THAT HAD ITS SOURCE AWAY BACK IN THE WOODS OF THE OLD CUTHBERT PLACE IT WAS REPUTED TO BE AN INTRICATE HEADLONG BROOK IN ITS EARLIER COURSE THROUGH THOSE WOODS WITH DARK SECRETS OF POOL AND CASCADE BUT BY THE TIME IT REACHED LYNDE'S HOLLOW IT WAS A QUIET WELL CONDUCTED LITTLE STREAM
ANYBODY WHO WENT OUT OF IT OR INTO IT HAD TO PASS OVER THAT HILL ROAD AND SO RUN THE UNSEEN GAUNTLET OF MISSUS RACHEL'S ALL SEEING EYE SHE WAS SITTING THERE ONE AFTERNOON IN EARLY JUNE THE SUN WAS COMING IN AT THE WINDOW WARM AND BRIGHT
MISSUS RACHEL KNEW THAT HE OUGHT BECAUSE SHE HAD HEARD HIM TELL PETER MORRISON THE EVENING BEFORE IN WILLIAM J BLAIR'S STORE OVER AT CARMODY THAT HE MEANT TO SOW HIS TURNIP SEED THE NEXT AFTERNOON
HAD IT BEEN ANY OTHER MAN IN AVONLEA MISSUS RACHEL DEFTLY PUTTING THIS AND THAT TOGETHER MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A PRETTY GOOD GUESS AS TO BOTH QUESTIONS BUT MATTHEW SO RARELY WENT FROM HOME THAT IT MUST BE SOMETHING PRESSING AND UNUSUAL WHICH WAS TAKING HIM
HE WAS THE SHYEST MAN ALIVE AND HATED TO HAVE TO GO AMONG STRANGERS OR TO ANY PLACE WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TO TALK MATTHEW DRESSED UP WITH A WHITE COLLAR AND DRIVING IN A BUGGY WAS SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN OFTEN MISSUS RACHEL PONDER AS SHE MIGHT COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT
BARELY VISIBLE FROM THE MAIN ROAD ALONG WHICH ALL THE OTHER AVONLEA HOUSES WERE SO SOCIABLY SITUATED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE DID NOT CALL LIVING IN SUCH A PLACE LIVING AT ALL IT'S JUST STAYING THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID AS SHE STEPPED ALONG THE DEEP RUTTED GRASSY LANE
ONE COULD HAVE EATEN A MEAL OFF THE GROUND WITHOUT OVERBRIMMING THE PROVERBIAL PECK OF DIRT MISSUS RACHEL RAPPED SMARTLY AT THE KITCHEN DOOR AND STEPPED IN WHEN BIDDEN TO DO SO THE KITCHEN AT GREEN GABLES WAS A CHEERFUL APARTMENT
AND HERE SHE SAT NOW KNITTING AND THE TABLE BEHIND HER WAS LAID FOR SUPPER MISSUS RACHEL BEFORE SHE HAD FAIRLY CLOSED THE DOOR
THERE WERE THREE PLATES LAID SO THAT MARILLA MUST BE EXPECTING SOME ONE HOME WITH MATTHEW TO TEA BUT THE DISHES WERE EVERYDAY DISHES AND THERE WAS ONLY CRAB APPLE PRESERVES AND ONE KIND OF CAKE SO THAT THE EXPECTED COMPANY COULD NOT BE ANY PARTICULAR COMPANY
THEY MAY BE ALL RIGHT I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE NOT BUT NO LONDON STREET ARABS FOR ME I SAID GIVE ME A NATIVE BORN AT LEAST THERE'LL BE A RISK NO MATTER WHO WE GET BUT I'LL FEEL EASIER IN MY MIND AND SLEEP SOUNDER AT NIGHTS IF WE GET A BORN CANADIAN
SO MATTHEW WENT TO BRIGHT RIVER TO MEET HIM MISSUS SPENCER WILL DROP HIM OFF THERE OF COURSE SHE GOES ON TO WHITE SANDS STATION HERSELF MISSUS RACHEL PRIDED HERSELF ON ALWAYS SPEAKING HER MIND SHE PROCEEDED TO SPEAK IT NOW HAVING ADJUSTED HER MENTAL ATTITUDE TO THIS AMAZING PIECE OF NEWS
NOR HOW HE'S LIKELY TO TURN OUT WHY IT WAS ONLY LAST WEEK I READ IN THE PAPER HOW A MAN AND HIS WIFE UP WEST OF THE ISLAND TOOK A BOY OUT OF AN ORPHAN ASYLUM AND HE SET FIRE TO THE HOUSE AT NIGHT SET IT ON PURPOSE MARILLA AND NEARLY BURNT THEM TO A CRISP IN THEIR BEDS
IT SEEMS UNCANNY TO THINK OF A CHILD AT GREEN GABLES SOMEHOW THERE'S NEVER BEEN ONE THERE FOR MATTHEW AND MARILLA WERE GROWN UP WHEN THE NEW HOUSE WAS BUILT IF THEY EVER WERE CHILDREN WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THEM I WOULDN'T BE IN THAT ORPHAN'S SHOES FOR ANYTHING
CHAPTER TWO MATTHEW CUTHBERT IS SURPRISED MATTHEW CUTHBERT AND THE SORREL MARE JOGGED COMFORTABLY OVER THE EIGHT MILES TO BRIGHT RIVER IT WAS A PRETTY ROAD RUNNING ALONG BETWEEN SNUG FARMSTEADS WITH NOW AND AGAIN A BIT OF BALSAMY FIR WOOD TO DRIVE THROUGH
SHE'S A CASE I SHOULD SAY I'M NOT EXPECTING A GIRL SAID MATTHEW BLANKLY IT'S A BOY I'VE COME FOR HE SHOULD BE HERE MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS TO BRING HIM OVER FROM NOVA SCOTIA FOR ME THE STATIONMASTER WHISTLED
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL WHAT DID THAT TREE LEANING OUT FROM THE BANK ALL WHITE AND LACY MAKE YOU THINK OF SHE ASKED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW WHY A BRIDE OF COURSE A BRIDE ALL IN WHITE WITH A LOVELY MISTY VEIL
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BUT I CAN IMAGINE WHAT SHE WOULD LOOK LIKE I DON'T EVER EXPECT TO BE A BRIDE MYSELF I'M SO HOMELY NOBODY WILL EVER WANT TO MARRY ME UNLESS IT MIGHT BE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY I SUPPOSE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY MIGHTN'T BE VERY PARTICULAR
BUT I DO HOPE THAT SOME DAY I SHALL HAVE A WHITE DRESS THAT IS MY HIGHEST IDEAL OF EARTHLY BLISS I JUST LOVE PRETTY CLOTHES AND I'VE NEVER HAD A PRETTY DRESS IN MY LIFE THAT I CAN REMEMBER BUT OF COURSE IT'S ALL THE MORE TO LOOK FORWARD TO ISN'T IT AND THEN
SHE SAID SHE HADN'T TIME TO GET SICK WATCHING TO SEE THAT I DIDN'T FALL OVERBOARD SHE SAID SHE NEVER SAW THE BEAT OF ME FOR PROWLING ABOUT BUT IF IT KEPT HER FROM BEING SEASICK IT'S A MERCY I DID PROWL ISN'T IT AND I WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO BE SEEN ON THAT BOAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I'D EVER HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
HE DETESTED THE WAY THEY HAD OF SIDLING PAST HIM TIMIDLY WITH SIDEWISE GLANCES AS IF THEY EXPECTED HIM TO GOBBLE THEM UP AT A MOUTHFUL IF THEY VENTURED TO SAY A WORD THAT WAS THE AVONLEA TYPE OF WELL BRED LITTLE GIRL BUT THIS FRECKLED WITCH WAS VERY DIFFERENT
AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD ALL HER MOTHER'S AMOROUS AND PECUNIARY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE INTIMATE SECRETARY MOREOVER
STILL WHEN HE RECOLLECTED THE INDEPENDENT PROUD SPIRIT OF EUGENIE HE POSITIVELY REJECTED IT AS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THOUGH THE SAME THOUGHT AGAIN CONTINUALLY RECURRED AND FOUND A RESTING PLACE IN HIS HEART TEA PLAY
AND HAD GONE TO BED AND TO SLEEP SHE CALLED THE MAID AND QUESTIONED HER MADEMOISELLE EUGENIE SAID THE MAID
AND HER GLANCE WAS TURNED TOWARDS HEAVEN
AND YET HIS MANNERS SHOWED THE EFFECTS OF A SORT OF EDUCATION IF NOT A COMPLETE ONE
NO ONE COULD SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACQUAINTED WITH OR HAD LENT HIMSELF TO ANY OF ANDREA'S INTRIGUES
HE HAD ONLY TO TURN HIS EYES ON ONE SIDE AND ALLOW ANDREA TO FLY AND FOLLOW UP THE CRIME UNDER THAT SHADOW OF GUILT CALLED CONTEMPT OF COURT AND AFTER THIS REASONING SHE SLEPT EASILY
FOR THE LAST MONTH THIS WRETCHED HOUSE HAD PRESENTED THE GLOOMY APPEARANCE OF A LAZARETTO INFECTED WITH THE PLAGUE SOME OF THE APARTMENTS WERE CLOSED WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE SHUTTERS WERE ONLY OPENED TO ADMIT A MINUTE'S AIR SHOWING THE SCARED FACE OF A FOOTMAN
THREE TIMES DID THE BELL RING WITH A DULL HEAVY SOUND SEEMING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GENERAL SADNESS BEFORE THE CONCIERGE APPEARED AND PEEPED THROUGH THE DOOR WHICH HE OPENED JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIS WORDS TO BE HEARD
SAID THE PROCUREUR WITH HIS IMPERTURBABLE CALMNESS OF MANNER I CONSIDER THOSE ALONE MISFORTUNES WHICH ARE IRREPARABLE AND DO YOU SUPPOSE THIS WILL BE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING WILL BE FORGOTTEN MADAME SAID VILLEFORT
BUT THIS ANNOYS YOU LET US CHANGE THE SUBJECT YOU WERE SAYING MADAME I CAME TO ASK YOU MY FRIEND SAID THE BARONESS WHAT WILL BE DONE WITH THIS IMPOSTOR IMPOSTOR
IMPOSSIBLE MADAME JUSTICE HAS ITS FORMALITIES WHAT EVEN FOR ME SAID THE BARONESS HALF JESTING HALF IN EARNEST FOR ALL EVEN FOR MYSELF AMONG THE REST
YOU WHO PURSUE CRIME SO VINDICTIVELY ANSWER NOW
AND WHO IS THIS WRETCH WHO CAN TELL A VAGABOND A CORSICAN HAS NO ONE OWNED HIM NO ONE HIS PARENTS ARE UNKNOWN
BUT WHO WAS THE MAN WHO BROUGHT HIM FROM LUCCA ANOTHER RASCAL LIKE HIMSELF PERHAPS HIS ACCOMPLICE THE BARONESS CLASPED HER HANDS
WELL BE IT SO LET ME BLUSH FOR THE FAULTS YOU KNOW AND PERHAPS PERHAPS FOR EVEN MORE THAN THOSE BUT HAVING SINNED MYSELF IT MAY BE MORE DEEPLY THAN OTHERS
BUT THIS IS TRAMPLING ON THE WEAK SIR THE WEAKNESS OF A MURDERER HIS DISHONOR REFLECTS UPON US
PALE AND COLD ADIEU SIR SHE SAID ADIEU MADAME REPLIED THE KING'S ATTORNEY AS IN AN ALMOST JOYFUL MANNER HE CONDUCTED HER TO THE DOOR
GEORGE MISSUS DARLING EXCLAIMED PAINED TO SEE HER DEAR ONE SHOWING HIMSELF IN SUCH AN UNFAVOURABLE LIGHT THEN HE BURST INTO TEARS AND THE TRUTH CAME OUT HE WAS AS GLAD TO HAVE THEM AS SHE WAS HE SAID
MIND YOU I AM NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE A DRAWING ROOM BUT WE PRETEND WE HAVE AND IT'S ALL THE SAME HOOP LA HE WENT OFF DANCING THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL CRIED HOOP LA AND DANCED AFTER HIM SEARCHING FOR THE DRAWING ROOM AND I FORGET WHETHER THEY FOUND IT
MAY I MUMMY CERTAINLY NOT I HAVE GOT YOU HOME AGAIN AND I MEAN TO KEEP YOU BUT HE DOES SO NEED A MOTHER SO DO YOU MY LOVE OH ALL RIGHT PETER SAID AS IF HE HAD ASKED HER FROM POLITENESS MERELY
THOUGH THEY JEERED AT HIM SO HE WAS WITH WENDY WHEN PETER CAME FOR HER AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR SHE FLEW AWAY WITH PETER IN THE FROCK SHE HAD WOVEN FROM LEAVES AND BERRIES IN THE NEVERLAND AND HER ONE FEAR WAS THAT HE MIGHT NOTICE HOW SHORT IT HAD BECOME BUT HE NEVER NOTICED HE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT HIMSELF
BUT THEY ARE SO LITTLE THAT A SHORT TIME SEEMS A GOOD WHILE TO THEM WENDY WAS PAINED TOO TO FIND THAT THE PAST YEAR WAS BUT AS YESTERDAY TO PETER
PERHAPS HE IS ILL MICHAEL SAID YOU KNOW HE IS NEVER ILL MICHAEL CAME CLOSE TO HER AND WHISPERED WITH A SHIVER PERHAPS THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON WENDY AND THEN WENDY WOULD HAVE CRIED IF MICHAEL HAD NOT BEEN CRYING
PETER CAME NEXT SPRING CLEANING AND THE STRANGE THING WAS THAT HE NEVER KNEW HE HAD MISSED A YEAR THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THE GIRL WENDY EVER SAW HIM FOR A LITTLE LONGER SHE TRIED FOR HIS SAKE NOT TO HAVE GROWING PAINS
YOU SEE THAT JUDGE IN A WIG COMING OUT AT THE IRON DOOR THAT USED TO BE TOOTLES THE BEARDED MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANY STORY TO TELL HIS CHILDREN
TRYING TO IMITATE PETER'S CROW NO IT WASN'T JANE SAID GRAVELY
A BIG WOMAN HULLO WENDY HE SAID NOT NOTICING ANY DIFFERENCE FOR HE WAS THINKING CHIEFLY OF HIMSELF AND IN THE DIM LIGHT HER WHITE DRESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NIGHTGOWN IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER FIRST HULLO PETER
FOR ALMOST THE ONLY TIME IN HIS LIFE THAT I KNOW OF PETER WAS AFRAID DON'T TURN UP THE LIGHT HE CRIED SHE LET HER HANDS PLAY IN THE HAIR OF THE TRAGIC BOY SHE WAS NOT A LITTLE GIRL HEART BROKEN ABOUT HIM
AND WENDY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO COMFORT HIM THOUGH SHE COULD HAVE DONE IT SO EASILY ONCE SHE WAS ONLY A WOMAN NOW AND SHE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM TO TRY TO THINK PETER CONTINUED TO CRY AND SOON HIS SOBS WOKE JANE
IT WAS ALREADY HER EASIEST WAY OF MOVING ABOUT WENDY RUSHED TO THE WINDOW NO NO SHE CRIED IT IS JUST FOR SPRING CLEANING TIME JANE SAID HE WANTS ME ALWAYS TO DO HIS SPRING CLEANING
IF ONLY I COULD GO WITH YOU WENDY SIGHED YOU SEE YOU CAN'T FLY SAID JANE OF COURSE IN THE END WENDY LET THEM FLY AWAY TOGETHER
OUR LAST GLIMPSE OF HER SHOWS HER AT THE WINDOW
I'M SURE SHE HAS LIVED ALL HER LIFE IN A BOARDING HOUSE AND I DETEST THE MANNERS AND THE LIBERTIES OF SUCH PLACES IF YOU ASK ME IF I PREFER MY OWN MANNERS WHICH YOU DOUBTLESS THINK VERY BAD I'LL TELL YOU THAT I PREFER THEM IMMENSELY
WHICH EXCITED A VEIN OF COUNTER ARGUMENT ON THE PART OF THE CORRESPONDENT OF THE INTERVIEWER WHO IN THE EXERCISE OF HER PROFESSION HAD ACQUAINTED HERSELF IN THE WESTERN WORLD WITH EVERY FORM OF CARAVANSARY
SHOULD YOU LIKE ME BETTER IF I WERE YOUR BUTLER DEAR HER HUSBAND ASKED I DON'T THINK I SHOULD YOU WOULDN'T AT ALL HAVE THE TENUE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN I LIKE THAT MISS STACKPOLE SAID RALPH
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION WHEN I SAID FREEMEN I DIDN'T MEAN YOU SIR AND THIS WAS THE ONLY REWARD THAT RALPH GOT FOR HIS COMPLIMENT MISS STACKPOLE WAS BAFFLED
ISABEL RESPONDED YOU SAY THAT RIGHT I HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TALK WITH HIM HE HAS COME AFTER YOU DID HE TELL YOU SO NO HE TOLD ME NOTHING THAT'S HOW I KNEW IT SAID HENRIETTA CLEVERLY
HE SAID VERY LITTLE ABOUT YOU BUT I SPOKE OF YOU A GOOD DEAL ISABEL WAITED AT THE MENTION OF MISTER GOODWOOD'S NAME SHE HAD TURNED A LITTLE PALE I'M VERY SORRY YOU DID THAT SHE OBSERVED AT LAST
BUT SHE FALTERED BEFORE HER FRIEND'S IMPLACABLE GLITTER MY DEAR CHILD YOU CERTAINLY ENCOURAGED HIM ISABEL MADE FOR THE MOMENT AS IF TO DENY THIS CHARGE INSTEAD OF WHICH HOWEVER SHE PRESENTLY ANSWERED
I HOPE HE'LL HATE ME THEN SAID ISABEL I BELIEVE YOU HOPE IT ABOUT AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE HIM CAPABLE OF IT TO THIS OBSERVATION OUR HEROINE MADE NO RETURN
BUT SHE WAS NOTIFIED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS OCCASION OF THE FINITE CHARACTER OF BUNCHIE'S INTELLECT HITHERTO SHE HAD BEEN MAINLY STRUCK WITH ITS EXTENT
CASPAR GOODWOOD ISABEL READ THIS MISSIVE WITH SUCH DEEP ATTENTION THAT SHE HAD NOT PERCEIVED AN APPROACHING TREAD ON THE SOFT GRASS
BUT WAS NEVER OVER INQUISITIVE AS REGARDS THE TERRITORY OF HER NEIGHBOUR ISABEL CAME AT LAST TO HAVE A KIND OF UNDEMONSTRABLE PITY FOR HER THERE SEEMED SOMETHING SO DREARY IN THE CONDITION OF A PERSON WHOSE NATURE HAD AS IT WERE
SO LITTLE SURFACE OFFERED SO LIMITED A FACE TO THE ACCRETIONS OF HUMAN CONTACT NOTHING TENDER NOTHING SYMPATHETIC HAD EVER HAD A CHANCE TO FASTEN UPON IT
YOU SEEM TO ME TROUBLED SAID RALPH I AM TROUBLED ABOUT WHAT FOR A MOMENT SHE ANSWERED NOTHING THEN SHE BROKE OUT DO YOU THINK IT GOOD FOR ME SUDDENLY TO BE MADE SO RICH
RALPH WENT ON MORE GRAVELY I THINK IT VERY GOOD FOR YOU TO HAVE MEANS ISABEL LOOKED AT HIM WITH SERIOUS EYES I WONDER WHETHER YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME OR WHETHER YOU CARE IF I KNOW DEPEND UPON IT I CARE
ISABEL HAD LISTENED QUICKLY YOU'VE TOO MUCH POWER OF THOUGHT ABOVE ALL TOO MUCH CONSCIENCE RALPH ADDED IT'S OUT OF ALL REASON THE NUMBER OF THINGS YOU THINK WRONG PUT BACK YOUR WATCH DIET YOUR FEVER
AS YET FOR REGARDING AS AGITATED BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PICTURING TO HERSELF BY THE LIGHT OF HER HOPES HER FEARS HER FANCIES HER AMBITIONS HER PREDILECTIONS
LIVID LIGHT OF A JUDGEMENT DAY THE GIRL MOREOVER WAS NOT PRONE TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT SHE HERSELF LIVED IN THE MIND OF OTHERS
SHE SHOULD RECEIVE THE NEWS WITHOUT A PANG EVEN OF SURPRISE IT WOULD HAVE PROVED THAT HE BELIEVED SHE WAS FIRM WHICH WAS WHAT SHE WISHED TO SEEM TO HIM
ON APRIL FOURTH A CONFERENCE WAS OPENED BETWEEN THE ENVOYS AND SIX COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED BY THE STATES TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSALS OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT FOR A MORE STRICT AND INTIMATE ALLIANCE AND UNION BETWEEN THE TWO STATES THE DUTCH QUICKLY PERCEIVED
THERE WAS CONSTERNATION IN HOLLAND AND THE STATES GENERAL DETERMINED TO SEND A SPECIAL EMBASSY TO LONDON
A MAN IN WHOSE RIPE JUDGMENT THEY HAD CONFIDENCE TO THE OFFICE OF COUNCIL PENSIONARY
NOW LIEUTENANT ADMIRAL OF HOLLAND WAS SENT TO SEA WITH FIFTY SHIPS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO PROTECT DUTCH MERCHANTMEN FROM INTERFERENCE AND TO SEE THAT THE STATES SUFFERED NO AFFRONT NOTHING WAS ACTUALLY SAID ABOUT THE STRIKING OF THE FLAG
IT CAME SUDDENLY THROUGH A MISUNDERSTANDING THE DUTCH ADMIRAL WHILE CRUISING PAST DOVER MET ON MAY TWENTY NINTH FIFTEEN ENGLISH SHIPS UNDER BLAKE
BUT POPULAR FEELING ON BOTH SIDES WAS NOW AROUSED
WAS SUPERIOR IN ALMOST ALL OTHER RESPECTS THE STUARTS HAD DEVOTED GREAT ATTENTION TO THE FLEET AND WOULD HAVE DONE MORE BUT FOR LACK OF MEANS CHARLES MUCH ABUSED SHIP MONEY WAS EMPLOYED BY HIM FOR THE CREATION OF THE FIRST ENGLISH PROFESSIONAL NAVY
EARLY IN JULY SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO BLAKE AT THE HEAD OF SIXTY SHIPS SET SAIL FOR THE NORTH TO INTERCEPT THE DUTCH BALTIC COMMERCE AND TO DESTROY THEIR FISHING FLEET OFF THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND
TROMP WAS PREVENTED FROM FOLLOWING BLAKE BY STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS HE THEN TURNED UPON AYSCUE WHOSE SMALL FORCE HE MUST HAVE OVERWHELMED BUT FOR A SUDDEN CHANGE TO A SOUTHERLY GALE THE DUTCH ADMIRAL NOW SAILED NORTHWARDS AND JULY TWENTY FIFTH
AND TO MEET AND CONVOY BACK THE HOME COMING SHIPS
AND AS THE ORANGE PARTISANS WERE EVERYWHERE CLAMOROUSLY ACTIVE THE ADMIRAL WAS SUSPECT IN HIS PLACE CORNELISZ WITTE DE WITH WAS APPOINTED A CAPABLE SAILOR BUT DISLIKED IN THE FLEET AS MUCH AS TROMP WAS BELOVED DE WITH EFFECTED A JUNCTION WITH DE RUYTER
THE OLD HERO FELL MORTALLY WOUNDED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF WHAT PROVED TO BE AN UNEQUAL FIGHT
COMPENSATION TO BE MADE FOR THE MASSACRE OF AMBOINA AND THE OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT PUNISHED THE NUMBER OF WARSHIPS IN ENGLISH WATERS WAS TO BE LIMITED THE FLAG HAD TO BE STRUCK WHEN ENGLISH SHIPS WERE MET AND THE RIGHT OF SEARCH TO BE PERMITTED THESE DEMANDS
TO INCREASE THE FLEET AND SECURE THE ACTIVE CO OPERATION OF DENMARK AND FRANCE BOTH FRIENDLY TO THE STATES BUT CROMWELL REALLY WANTED PEACE AND SHOWED HIMSELF READY TO YIELD ON CERTAIN MINOR POINTS BUT HE CONTINUED TO INSIST ON THE EXCLUSION OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
ADDRESSED TO THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND NOT AT THE MOMENT IN SESSION
THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO PASS A VOTE OF THANKS TO THE ENVOYS FOR NOT HAVING DELIVERED THE ACT TO CROMWELL DE WITT'S POSITION APPEARED HOPELESS
WHILE THE CLERK WAS LABORIOUSLY DECIPHERING THE DESPATCH THE ENVOYS READ BETWEEN THE LINES OF DE WITT'S LETTER AND WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY WENT TO WHITEHALL AND PLACED THE ACT IN CROMWELL'S HANDS THE STATES GENERAL HAD THUS NO ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN ACCEPTANCE OF THE FAIT ACCOMPLI
AND FROM THE SKILL AND COURAGE WITH WHICH HE ACHIEVED HIS END IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES AND DIFFICULTIES THAT SEEMED INSURMOUNTABLE BUT FOR THE COURSE OF DOUBLE DEALING AND CHICANERY BY WHICH HE TRIUMPHED THE ONLY DEFENCE THAT CAN BE OFFERED IS THAT THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY
THERE IS HOWEVER EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT DE WITT WAS PROMPTED TO TAKE THE RISKS HE DID BY PURELY PATRIOTIC MOTIVES AND NOT THROUGH SPITE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ORANGE
SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER DIP IN EGG AND CORN MEAL AND FRY IN DEEP FAT
DRAIN AND SERVE WITH OYSTER SAUCE PERCH A L'ALLEMANDE PUT TWO LARGE CLEANED PERCH INTO A SAUCEPAN WITH TWO CHOPPED CARROTS A SPRIG OF PARSLEY A CELERY ROOT A SLICED ONION AND A PINCH OF SALT
COOK WITH A TABLESPOONFUL EACH OF BUTTER AND FLOUR THICKENED TOGETHER TAKE FROM THE FIRE ADD A TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER AND THE JUICE OF TWO LEMONS POUR OVER THE FISH AND SERVE
EVERY PROMISE OF THE SOUL HAS INNUMERABLE FULFILMENTS EACH OF ITS JOYS RIPENS INTO A NEW WANT NATURE UNCONTAINABLE FLOWING FORELOOKING
IN THE FIRST SENTIMENT OF KINDNESS ANTICIPATES ALREADY A BENEVOLENCE WHICH SHALL LOSE ALL PARTICULAR REGARDS IN ITS GENERAL LIGHT THE INTRODUCTION TO THIS FELICITY IS IN A PRIVATE AND TENDER RELATION OF ONE TO ONE WHICH IS THE ENCHANTMENT OF HUMAN LIFE
WHICH HAVE GIVEN HIM SINCEREST INSTRUCTION AND NOURISHMENT HE WILL SHRINK AND MOAN ALAS I KNOW NOT WHY BUT INFINITE COMPUNCTIONS EMBITTER IN MATURE LIFE THE REMEMBRANCES OF BUDDING JOY AND COVER EVERY BELOVED NAME
DWELL CARE AND CANKER AND FEAR WITH THOUGHT WITH THE IDEAL IS IMMORTAL HILARITY THE ROSE OF JOY ROUND IT ALL THE MUSES SING BUT GRIEF CLEAVES TO NAMES AND PERSONS AND THE PARTIAL INTERESTS OF TO DAY AND YESTERDAY
THE STRONG BENT OF NATURE IS SEEN IN THE PROPORTION WHICH THIS TOPIC OF PERSONAL RELATIONS USURPS IN THE CONVERSATION OF SOCIETY WHAT DO WE WISH TO KNOW OF ANY WORTHY PERSON SO MUCH AS HOW HE HAS SPED IN THE HISTORY OF THIS SENTIMENT
AND WHAT FASTENS ATTENTION IN THE INTERCOURSE OF LIFE LIKE ANY PASSAGE BETRAYING AFFECTION BETWEEN TWO PARTIES PERHAPS WE NEVER SAW THEM BEFORE AND NEVER SHALL MEET THEM AGAIN BUT WE SEE THEM EXCHANGE A GLANCE OR BETRAY A DEEP EMOTION AND WE ARE NO LONGER STRANGERS
NO MAN EVER FORGOT THE VISITATIONS OF THAT POWER TO HIS HEART AND BRAIN WHICH CREATED ALL THINGS ANEW WHICH WAS THE DAWN IN HIM OF MUSIC POETRY AND ART WHICH MADE THE FACE OF NATURE RADIANT WITH PURPLE LIGHT
THE WORDS OF THE BELOVED OBJECT ARE NOT LIKE OTHER IMAGES WRITTEN IN WATER BUT AS PLUTARCH SAID ENAMELLED IN FIRE AND MAKE THE STUDY OF MIDNIGHT THOU ART NOT GONE BEING GONE WHERE'ER THOU ART
THE CLOUDS HAVE FACES AS HE LOOKS ON THEM THE TREES OF THE FOREST THE WAVING GRASS AND THE PEEPING FLOWERS HAVE GROWN INTELLIGENT AND HE ALMOST FEARS TO TRUST THEM WITH THE SECRET WHICH THEY SEEM TO INVITE YET NATURE SOOTHES AND SYMPATHIZES
A MIDNIGHT BELL A PASSING GROAN THESE ARE THE SOUNDS WE FEED UPON BEHOLD THERE IN THE WOOD THE FINE MADMAN HE IS A PALACE OF SWEET SOUNDS AND SIGHTS HE DILATES HE IS TWICE A MAN
THE APOLOGIES WHICH ARE DUE TO YOU I FEEL THAT ANYTHING LESS WILL NEITHER REHABILITATE ME IN YOUR ESTEEM NOR SECURE FOR ME THE REMNANTS OF MY SHATTERED SELF RESPECT I AM HOPING YOU WILL DINE WITH ME NEXT WEEK AND MEET A MOST INTERESTING MAN GEORGE GATHERCOLE
KARA FOLDED THE LETTER AND INSERTED IT IN ITS ENVELOPE HE RANG A BELL ON HIS TABLE AND THE GIRL WHO HAD SO FILLED T X WITH A SENSE OF AWE CAME FROM AN ADJOINING ROOM YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS IS DELIVERED MISS HOLLAND
AND YOU WILL HURT HIM BEYOND FORGETFULNESS FEAR IS A TYRANT AND A DESPOT MORE TERRIBLE THAN THE RACK MORE POTENT THAN THE STAKE FEAR IS MANY EYED AND SEES HORRORS WHERE NORMAL VISION ONLY SEES THE RIDICULOUS
TO REFUSE THE FAVOURS OF REMINGTON KARA WAS BY HIM REGARDED AS SOMETHING OF AN AFFRONT
A PAIR OF PINCE NEZ SAT CROOKEDLY ON HIS NOSE AND TWO FAT VOLUMES UNDER HIS ARM COMPLETED THE PICTURE FISHER WHO WAS AN OBSERVER OF SOME DISCERNMENT NOTICED UNDER THE OVERCOAT A CREASED BLUE SUIT LARGE BLACK BOOTS
DEFTLY HE LIFTED HIS LEFT HAND FROM THE POCKET CROOKED THE ELBOW BY SOME QUICK MANIPULATION AND THRUST THE BOOKS WHICH THE VALET MOST RELUCTANTLY HANDED TO HIM BACK TO THE PLACE FROM WHENCE HE HAD TAKEN THEM TELL MISTER KARA I WILL CALL AT MY OWN TIME
FISHER WENT BACK TO THE LIBRARY THE GIRL WAS SEALING UP SOME LETTERS AS HE ENTERED AND LOOKED UP I AM AFRAID MISS HOLLAND I'VE GOT MYSELF INTO VERY SERIOUS TROUBLE WHAT IS THAT FISHER ASKED THE GIRL
THE MAID WHO WAS ALSO COOK AROSE UP AS THE GIRL ENTERED IT'S A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES TO SEE YOU IN MY KITCHEN MISS SHE SMILED I'M AFRAID YOU'RE RATHER LONELY MISSUS BEALE SAID THE GIRL SYMPATHETICALLY LONELY MISS CRIED THE MAID
I KNOW HE GOES IN SOMETIMES BECAUSE I TRIED A DODGE THAT MY BROTHER WHO'S A POLICEMAN TAUGHT ME I STRETCHED A BIT OF WHITE COTTON ACROSS IT AN IT WAS BROKE THE NEXT MORNING MISTER KARA KEEPS SOME OF HIS PRIVATE PAPERS IN THERE SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY HE HAS TOLD ME SO HIMSELF
IT CARRIED HIM BACK A DOZEN YEARS TO A DIRTY LITTLE PEASANT'S CABIN ON THE HILLSIDE OUTSIDE DURAZZO TO THE LIVID FACE OF A YOUNG ALBANIAN CHIEF WHO HAD LOST AT KARA'S WHIM ALL THAT LIFE HELD FOR A MAN
HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER GATHERCOLE AND KARA CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE TO MEET HIS AGENT WHO WITH TOP HAT STILL ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND HIS OVERCOAT DANGLING ABOUT HIS HEELS MUST HAVE MADE A REMARKABLE PICTURE
FISHER CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND RETURNED TO HIS DUTIES IN THE HALL BELOW TEN MINUTES LATER HE HEARD THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BOOMING VOICE OF THE STRANGER CAME DOWN TO HIM FISHER WENT UP THE STAIRS TO MEET HIM AND FOUND HIM ADDRESSING THE OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM IN HIS OWN ECCENTRIC FASHION
NO MORE PATAGONIA HE ROARED NO MORE TIERRA DEL FUEGO HE PAUSED CERTAINLY HE REPLIED TO SOME QUESTION BUT NOT PATAGONIA HE PAUSED AGAIN
ALWAYS GET YOUR MONEY IN ADVANCE IS THAT CLEAR TO YOU YES SIR SAID FISHER BUT I THINK YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND THAT MISTER KARA IS ALWAYS MOST GENEROUS ABOUT MONEY DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT MY POOR MAN SAID THE OTHER YOU
BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL IT TO BE WRONG THAT SO LITTLE NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THEM AND THAT HER FAILURE REALLY VERY GRATUITOUS TO MAKE HERSELF IMPORTANT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD NOT MUCH TO DO WITH THE ACRIMONY OF HER ALLUSIONS TO HER HUSBAND'S ADOPTED COUNTRY
ISABEL PRESENTLY FOUND HERSELF IN THE SINGULAR SITUATION OF DEFENDING THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION AGAINST HER AUNT
SHE WAS VERY CRITICAL HERSELF IT WAS INCIDENTAL TO HER AGE HER SEX AND HER NATIONALITY BUT SHE WAS VERY SENTIMENTAL AS WELL AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DRYNESS THAT SET HER OWN MORAL FOUNTAINS FLOWING NOW WHAT'S YOUR POINT OF VIEW
SHE ASKED OF HER AUNT WHEN YOU CRITICISE EVERYTHING HERE YOU SHOULD HAVE A POINT OF VIEW YOURS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AMERICAN YOU THOUGHT EVERYTHING OVER THERE SO DISAGREEABLE WHEN I CRITICISE I HAVE MINE IT'S THOROUGHLY AMERICAN
OF LAUGHING AT ALL THINGS BEGINNING WITH HIMSELF SUCH SLENDER FACULTY OF REVERENCE AS HE POSSESSED CENTRED WHOLLY UPON HIS FATHER FOR THE REST HE EXERCISED HIS WIT INDIFFERENTLY UPON HIS FATHER'S SON THIS GENTLEMAN'S WEAK LUNGS
IN THE FOLDS OF THE NATIONAL BANNER ISABEL'S CHIEF DREAD IN LIFE AT THIS PERIOD OF HER DEVELOPMENT WAS THAT SHE SHOULD APPEAR NARROW MINDED WHAT SHE FEARED NEXT AFTERWARDS WAS THAT SHE SHOULD REALLY BE SO BUT SHE NEVERTHELESS
SHE WOULD BE AS AMERICAN AS IT PLEASED HIM TO REGARD HER AND IF HE CHOSE TO LAUGH AT HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM PLENTY OF OCCUPATION SHE DEFENDED ENGLAND AGAINST HIS MOTHER BUT WHEN RALPH SANG ITS PRAISES ON PURPOSE AS SHE SAID TO WORK HER UP
I DON'T THINK YOU CARE FOR ANYTHING YOU DON'T REALLY CARE FOR ENGLAND WHEN YOU PRAISE IT YOU DON'T CARE FOR AMERICA EVEN WHEN YOU PRETEND TO ABUSE IT I CARE FOR NOTHING BUT YOU DEAR COUSIN SAID RALPH IF I COULD BELIEVE
AT A TIME WHEN HIS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF A BURDEN TO HIM HER SUDDEN ARRIVAL WHICH PROMISED NOTHING AND WAS AN OPEN HANDED GIFT OF FATE HAD REFRESHED AND QUICKENED THEM GIVEN THEM WINGS AND SOMETHING TO FLY FOR
POOR RALPH HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS STEEPED IN MELANCHOLY HIS OUTLOOK HABITUALLY SOMBRE LAY UNDER THE SHADOW OF A DEEPER CLOUD
AT THE PROSPECT OF LOSING HIS GREAT MOTIVE RALPH LOST INDEED HIS ONE INSPIRATION
FULL OF THE RURAL INCIDENTS SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND PAST COTTAGES THATCHED AND TIMBERED PAST ALE HOUSES LATTICED AND SANDED PAST PATCHES OF ANCIENT COMMON AND GLIMPSES OF EMPTY PARKS
BETWEEN HEDGEROWS MADE THICK BY MIDSUMMER WHEN THEY REACHED HOME THEY USUALLY FOUND TEA HAD BEEN SERVED ON THE LAWN
BUT THE TWO FOR THE MOST PART SAT SILENT THE OLD MAN WITH HIS HEAD BACK AND HIS EYES CLOSED HIS WIFE OCCUPIED WITH HER KNITTING AND WEARING THAT APPEARANCE OF RARE PROFUNDITY WITH WHICH SOME LADIES CONSIDER THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR NEEDLES
ONE DAY HOWEVER A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED THE TWO YOUNG PERSONS AFTER SPENDING AN HOUR ON THE RIVER STROLLED BACK TO THE HOUSE AND PERCEIVED LORD WARBURTON SITTING UNDER THE TREES AND ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION
HE DETERMINED TO POSTPONE HIS DEPARTURE TILL THE MORROW DURING THIS PERIOD HE ADDRESSED MANY OF HIS REMARKS TO ISABEL WHO ACCEPTED THIS EVIDENCE OF HIS ESTEEM WITH A VERY GOOD GRACE SHE FOUND HERSELF LIKING HIM EXTREMELY
THE FIRST IMPRESSION HE HAD MADE ON HER HAD HAD WEIGHT BUT AT THE END OF AN EVENING SPENT IN HIS SOCIETY SHE SCARCE FELL SHORT OF SEEING HIM THOUGH QUITE WITHOUT LURIDITY AS A HERO OF ROMANCE
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I SHOULD WAIT FOR YOU MISSUS TOUCHETT ANSWERED
MISSUS TOUCHETT GAVE A LITTLE LOOK OF DESPAIR AND SAT DOWN AGAIN
RALPH MEANWHILE HANDED ISABEL HER CANDLESTICK HE HAD BEEN WATCHING HER IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM HER TEMPER WAS INVOLVED AN ACCIDENT THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING BUT IF HE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING OF A FLARE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED FOR THE GIRL SIMPLY LAUGHED A LITTLE
YES I THINK I'M VERY FOND OF THEM BUT I ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW THE THINGS ONE SHOULDN'T DO SO AS TO DO THEM ASKED HER AUNT
BUT IT ONLY RINGS TO WARN US THAT OUR FRIENDS ARE IN GREAT DANGER THE KNIFE FREES ALL IT TOUCHES FROM THE SPELLS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID ON THEM WHILE THE STICK WILL CARRY YOU WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO I WILL GIVE YOU THE KNIFE TO GUARD YOU AGAINST THE ENCHANTMENTS OF WIZARDS
AND BESOUGHT HIM NOT TO BE SO MAD AND TO THROW AWAY HIS LIFE IN SUCH A FOOLISH MANNER BUT HE ONLY LAUGHED
THE PINK AND WHITE OF HER FACE REMINDED YOU OF THE SHELLS OF HER PALACE WHILE HER LONG BLACK HAIR WAS INTERTWINED WITH STRINGS OF CORAL AND HER DRESS OF GREEN SILK SEEMED FORMED OUT OF THE SEA AT THE SIGHT OF HER HOUARN STOPPED DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY
AND TO THE POND WHICH CONTAINED THE FISH THEIR SIDES SHINING WITH A THOUSAND DIFFERENT COLOURS
AT FIRST UNDER DIFFERENT ANIMAL SHAPES SINCE THAT TIME PARTLY FROM HABIT AND PARTLY TO AMUSE OURSELVES WE HAVE CONTINUED TO TRANSFORM OURSELVES AND IT WAS IN THIS WAY THAT I GOT TO KNOW YOU HOW EXCLAIMED JEGU FILLED WITH ASTONISHMENT
THE RACKS FILLED WITH HAY THE COWS MILKED AND THE PAILS STANDING NEATLY IN A ROW
AND MY WET LINEN TO BE STRETCHED ON THE HEDGE TO DRY AND SHE NEED NEVER GIVE ANOTHER THOUGHT TO THE MATTER IF SHE FOUND THE RYE BREAD TOO HARD TO BAKE OR THE OVEN TAKING TOO LONG TO HEAT SHE JUST MURMURED I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MY SIX LOAVES ON THE SHELF ABOVE THE BREAD BOX
AND SHE COULD SLEEP EVERY MORNING TILL BREAKFAST TIME JUST LIKE A YOUNG LADY AND AS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
INEVITABLE IN THE COMING TOGETHER OF ANY TWO PERSONS INTENSIFIED WHEN THOSE TWO PERSONS ARE AS DIFFERENT AS A MAN AND A WOMAN AND UNAVOIDABLE FOR TWO COMMITTED TO A LIFETIME TOGETHER IN THE CLOSE QUARTERS OF MARRIAGE TWO
IT IS AN EMPTY HONOR FOR THE ONE WHO BENDS BUT DOES NOT BREAK WILL READILY DEVELOP THE FINE ART OF INFLUENCING THE HEADSTRONG ONE BECAUSE IT IS PART OF THE TRADITIONAL FEMININE CHARACTER TO ENJOY GIVING IN TO THE MAN THIS TENDENCY MUST BE SCRUTINIZED WHEN IT APPEARS
A CHAMELEON CHANGES COLOR EASILY TO MATCH ITS ENVIRONMENT OR TEMPER OF THE MOMENT BUT A HUMAN BEING'S MORE LASTING CHANGE IS NOT SO READILY MADE EACH MARRIAGE PARTNER MUST BE PROUD OF THE OTHER AND LET THE OTHER CONTINUE TO BE PROUD OF HIM OR HER
THE FACTOR THAT UNDERLIES ALL THE PERPLEXITIES AND MOST OF THE CONTENTMENT OF MARRIAGE IS ITS UNIQUE DEGREE OF CONCENTRATED INTIMACY HERE THE SUPREME TESTING ALWAYS COMES EACH MEANS SO MUCH TO THE OTHER
AND THE TWO PERSONS HAVE TO WORK OUT A COMMON LIFE THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO THEM OVER AND ABOVE THE PLEASURE THEY MAY TAKE IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY AS A CONTINUING PART OF THIS LIFE ADJUSTMENT SEX ADJUSTMENT CAN DEVELOP INTO A PERMANENT FACTOR OF MARRIED HAPPINESS

BOBBY WALKED FROM THE ROOM HE HADN'T CARED TO REPLY HE FEARED AS IT WAS THAT HE HAD LET SLIP HIS INCREASED SELF DOUBT HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND HAT AND LEFT THE HOUSE THE RAW COLD THE YEAR'S FIRST OMEN OF WINTER MADE HIS BLOOD RUN QUICKER
THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
A STRANGE MAN APPEARED WALKING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE HIS BLACK CLOTHING RELIEVED ONLY BY NARROW EDGES OF WHITE CUFFS BETWEEN THE SLEEVES AND THE HEAVY MOURNING GLOVES FITTED WITH SOLEMN HARMONY INTO THE LANDSCAPE AND BOBBY'S MOOD
I WON'T BLAME CARLOS FOR THAT BOBBY MUTTERED HE INFLUENCED YOU AGAINST YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT GRAHAM PERSISTED TO REFUSE TO LEAVE WITH ME THE NIGHT OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH MARIA DID HER SHARE BOBBY SAID HE BROKE OFF LOOKING AT GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE TO DIRECT YOUR BODY WHEN YOUR MIND NO LONGER CONTROLLED IT IT'S A NASTY THOUGHT BUT I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS YOU MEAN CARLOS MAY HAVE MADE ME GO TO THE HALL LAST NIGHT PERHAPS SENT ME TO THE OLD ROOM THOSE OTHER TIMES
IF IT'S SO FAR FETCHED GRAHAM ASKED QUIETLY WHY DO YOU REVOLT FROM THE IDEA BOBBY TURNED ON HIM AND WHY DO YOU FILL MY MIND WITH SUCH THOUGHTS IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY SAY SO GO TELL ROBINSON SO
HIS EYES STUDYING THE FIRE HIS FINGERS ON THE CHAIR ARM WERE RESTLESS DOCTOR GROOM STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TALKING WITH THE CLERGYMAN A STOUT AND UNCTUOUS FIGURE
BOBBY WENT IN WITH THE OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT HE CATALOGUED REMEMBERED OBJECTS ALL INTIMATE TO HIS GRANDFATHER EACH ODDLY ENTANGLED IN HIS MIND WITH HIS DISLIKE OF THE OLD MAN THE IRON BED THE CHEST OF DRAWERS
FROM THE CHEST OF DRAWERS TWO CANDLES THE ONLY LIGHT

I DE LITE CLEANS DUSTS POLISHES ALL VARNISHED OR WAXED WOODWORK FLOORS PIANOS FURNITURE WHITE ENAMEL AUTOMOBILE BODIES WITH EASE AND SATISFACTION A SPOONFUL ON A DAMPENED CHEESE CLOTH WIPED OVER THE VARNISH AND POLISHED WITH A DRY CHEESE CLOTH
THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE THIS MATTER OF PERFUMES FROM OUR STANDPOINT
THE GENIE SPOKE TO HIM IN A TERRIBLE VOICE RISE THAT I MAY KILL THEE WITH THIS CIMETER AS THOU HAST KILLED MY SON AND ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS WITH A FRIGHTFUL CRY
REPLIED THE MERCHANT BUT CERTAINLY I NEVER KILLED YOUR SON AND IF I HAVE IT WAS UNKNOWN TO ME AND I DID IT INNOCENTLY I BEG YOU THEREFORE TO PARDON ME AND SUFFER ME TO LIVE NO NO RETURNED THE GENIE
PERSISTING IN HIS RESOLUTION I MUST KILL THEE SINCE THOU HAST KILLED MY SON THEN TAKING THE MERCHANT BY THE ARM HE THREW HIM WITH HIS FACE ON THE GROUND AND LIFTED UP HIS CIMETER TO CUT OFF HIS HEAD THE MERCHANT WITH TEARS
ALL THIS WHINING SAID THE MONSTER IS TO NO PURPOSE
IN THE ORIGINAL WORK SCHEHERAZADE CONTINUALLY BREAKS OFF TO ASK THE SULTAN TO SPARE HER LIFE FOR ANOTHER DAY THAT SHE MAY FINISH THE STORY SHE IS RELATING AS THESE INTERRUPTIONS CONSIDERABLY INTERFERE WITH THE CONTINUED INTEREST OF THE STORIES IT HAS BEEN DEEMED ADVISABLE TO OMIT THEM
THE CHILDREN ALL IN TEARS MADE THE HOUSE RESOUND WITH THEIR GROANS AND THE FATHER NOT BEING ABLE TO RESIST THE IMPULSE OF NATURE MINGLED HIS TEARS WITH THEIRS SO THAT IN A WORD THEY EXHIBITED THE MOST AFFECTING SPECTACLE POSSIBLE
SUBMIT WITH FORTITUDE TO THIS NECESSITY AND CONSIDER THAT IT IS THE DESTINY OF MAN TO DIE HAVING THUS SPOKEN HE WENT OUT OF THE HEARING OF THE CRIES OF HIS FAMILY AND PURSUING HIS JOURNEY ARRIVED ON THE DAY APPOINTED
BROTHER MAY I ASK WHY YOU ARE COME INTO THIS DESERT PLACE WHICH IS POSSESSED SOLELY BY EVIL SPIRITS AND WHERE CONSEQUENTLY YOU CANNOT BE SAFE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL TREES WHICH ARE SEEN HERE ONE MIGHT INDEED SUPPOSE THE PLACE INHABITED
SUFFERED HER TO LIVE THAT DAY ALSO THE NEXT MORNING DINARZADE MADE THE SAME REQUEST TO HER SISTER AS BEFORE MY DEAR SISTER SAID SHE
BUT THE SULTAN WISHING TO LEARN WHAT FOLLOWED BETWIXT THE MERCHANT AND THE GENIE BADE HER PROCEED WITH THAT WHICH SHE DID AS FOLLOWS SIR WHILE THE MERCHANT AND THE OLD MAN WHO LED THE HIND WERE CONVERSING
WHAT IS MORE MY WIFE SHE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN I MARRIED HER SO THAT I MAY JUSTLY SAY SHE OUGHT TO REGARD ME EQUALLY AS HER FATHER HER KINSMAN AND HER HUSBAND
AND COMBATING MY COMPASSION WHICH SUSPENDED THE SACRIFICE WAS GOING TO GIVE HER THE FATAL BLOW WHEN THE VICTIM REDOUBLING HER TEARS AND BELLOWING DISARMED ME A SECOND TIME
THAT I WOULD HAVE ANOTHER CALF TO SACRIFICE AND NOT THAT SHE USED ALL HER ENDEAVOURS TO PERSUADE ME TO CHANGE MY RESOLUTION BUT I CONTINUED FIRM
AS SOON AS I ARRIVED I WENT FORTHWITH TO THE STALL WHERE MY SON WAS KEPT HE COULD NOT RETURN MY EMBRACES BUT RECEIVED THEM IN SUCH A MANNER AS FULLY SATISFIED ME HE WAS MY SON
ONLY I MUST PRAY YOU NOT TO TAKE HER LIFE I AM GOING THEN ANSWERED SHE TO TREAT HER AS SHE TREATED YOUR SON TO THIS I CONSENT SAID I
AND IN AN INSTANT HE RECOVERED HIS NATURAL FORM MY SON
BUT IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT YOU WILL MAKE YOUR DELIVERER YOUR WIFE AS I HAVE PROMISED HE JOYFULLY CONSENTED BUT BEFORE THEY MARRIED SHE CHANGED MY WIFE INTO A HIND AND THIS IS SHE WHOM YOU SEE HERE
DO YOU ASSURE ME THAT YOU WILL CURE MY LEPROSY WITHOUT POTION OR APPLYING ANY EXTERNAL MEDICINE YES SIRE REPLIED THE PHYSICIAN I PROMISE MYSELF SUCCESS THROUGH GOD'S ASSISTANCE
AND TO MORROW WITH YOUR MAJESTY'S PERMISSION I WILL MAKE THE TRIAL THE PHYSICIAN RETURNED TO HIS QUARTERS MADE A HOLLOW MACE AND AT THE HANDLE HE PUT IN HIS DRUGS
WITH WHICH NEXT MORNING HE PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING AND FALLING DOWN AT HIS FEET KISSED THE GROUND
BOWED HIMSELF BEFORE THE THRONE WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND THE KING PERCEIVING HIM MADE HIM SIT DOWN BY HIS SIDE PRESENTED HIM TO THE ASSEMBLY AND GAVE HIM ALL THE COMMENDATION HE DESERVED
IT IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS FOR A MONARCH TO CONFIDE IN A MAN WHOSE FIDELITY HE HAS NEVER TRIED
I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS PHYSICIAN WHOM YOU SUSPECT TO BE A VILLAIN AND A TRAITOR IS ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST VIRTUOUS OF MEN YOU KNOW BY WHAT MEDICINE OR RATHER BY WHAT MIRACLE HE CURED ME OF MY LEPROSY
I SHOULD NEVER PAY HIM SUFFICIENTLY FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE I PERCEIVE IT TO BE HIS VIRTUE THAT RAISES YOUR ENVY BUT DO NOT THINK I WILL BE UNJUSTLY PREJUDICED AGAINST HIM I REMEMBER TOO WELL WHAT A VIZIER SAID TO KING SINBAD HIS MASTER
AFTER HAVING REPRESENTED TO KING SINBAD THAT HE OUGHT TO BEWARE LEST ON THE ACCUSATION OF A MOTHER IN LAW HE SHOULD COMMIT AN ACTION OF WHICH HE MIGHT AFTERWARDS REPENT
SHE WAS SILENT WHEN VIDA RAVED THAT THOUGH AMERICA HATED WAR AS MUCH AS EVER WE MUST INVADE GERMANY AND WIPE OUT EVERY MAN BECAUSE IT WAS NOW PROVEN THAT THERE WAS NO SOLDIER IN THE GERMAN ARMY WHO WAS NOT CRUCIFYING PRISONERS
WHICH SINCE ALL THE WORK WAS DONE BY ASSISTANTS WAS THE ONE SINECURE IN TOWN THE ONE REWARD FOR POLITICAL PURITY BUT IT PROVED THAT MISTER BERT TYBEE THE FORMER BARTENDER DESIRED THE POSTMASTERSHIP AT HER SOLICITATION
HE WAS WELL BUT STILL WEAK FROM HAVING BEEN GASSED HE HAD BEEN DISCHARGED AND HE CAME HOME AS THE FIRST OF THE WAR VETERANS IT WAS RUMORED THAT HE SURPRISED VIDA BY COMING UNANNOUNCED THAT VIDA FAINTED WHEN SHE SAW HIM AND FOR A NIGHT AND DAY
WOULD NOT SHARE HIM WITH THE TOWN WHEN CAROL SAW THEM VIDA WAS HAZY ABOUT EVERYTHING EXCEPT RAYMIE AND NEVER WENT SO FAR FROM HIM THAT SHE COULD NOT SLIP HER HAND UNDER HIS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHY CAROL WAS TROUBLED BY THIS INTENSITY
THE TOWNSMEN INVITED THEMSELVES TO THE FEAST MILLERS REAL ESTATE MEN LAWYERS MERCHANTS AND DOCTOR WILL KENNICOTT THEY BOUGHT LAND AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SOLD IT NEXT DAY AT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY AND BOUGHT AGAIN
IN THREE MONTHS KENNICOTT MADE SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH WAS RATHER MORE THAN FOUR TIMES AS MUCH AS SOCIETY PAID HIM FOR HEALING THE SICK IN EARLY SUMMER BEGAN A CAMPAIGN OF BOOSTING
CHUCKED HIM IN THE RIBS AND SAID SAY BOY
I'LL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW I'VE SEEN EM I'VE DONE EUROPE FROM SOUP TO NUTS THEY CAN'T SPRING THAT STUFF ON JIM BLAUSSER AND GET AWAY WITH IT AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE ONLY LIVE THING IN EUROPE IS OUR BOYS THAT ARE FIGHTING THERE NOW LONDON
NOW THE POINT OF THIS IS I'M NOT ONLY INSISTING THAT GOPHER PRAIRIE IS GOING TO BE MINNESOTA'S PRIDE THE BRIGHTEST RAY IN THE GLORY OF THE NORTH STAR STATE
SHE LEARNED THAT PLOVER AND MINNIEMASHIE LAKES WERE WORLD FAMED FOR THEIR BEAUTEOUS WOODED SHORES AND GAMEY PIKE AND BASS NOT TO BE EQUALLED ELSEWHERE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT THE RESIDENCES OF GOPHER PRAIRIE WERE MODELS
OF DIGNITY COMFORT AND CULTURE WITH LAWNS AND GARDENS KNOWN FAR AND WIDE THAT THE GOPHER PRAIRIE SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC LIBRARY IN ITS NEAT AND COMMODIOUS BUILDING WERE CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THE GOPHER PRAIRIE MILLS MADE THE
KENNICOTT WAS TRIUMPHANT WHEN THE COMMERCIAL CLUB DID CAPTURE ONE SMALL SHY FACTORY WHICH PLANNED TO MAKE WOODEN AUTOMOBILE WHEELS BUT WHEN CAROL SAW THE PROMOTER
AS SHE FLITTED UP SIXTEENTH STREET AFTER A KREISLER RECITAL GIVEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON FOR THE GOVERNMENT CLERKS AS THE LAMPS KINDLED IN SPHERES OF SOFT FIRE AS THE BREEZE FLOWED INTO THE STREET FRESH AS PRAIRIE WINDS AND KINDLIER
AS SHE GLANCED UP THE ELM ALLEY OF MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE AS SHE WAS RESTED BY THE INTEGRITY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE TEMPLE SHE LOVED THE CITY AS SHE LOVED NO ONE SAVE HUGH SHE ENCOUNTERED NEGRO SHANTIES TURNED INTO STUDIOS
WERE EQUALLY WICKED AND TO BE AVOIDED AND BY CLEAVING TO TINCOMB CHURCH THEY KEPT THEIR IDEALS FROM ALL CONTAMINATION THEY WELCOMED CAROL ASKED ABOUT HER HUSBAND GAVE HER ADVICE REGARDING COLIC IN BABIES
CHEMISTS AND GEOGRAPHERS AND FISCAL EXPERTS FROM THE BUREAUS AND A TEACHER WHO WAS A FAMILIAR OF THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE HEADQUARTERS THE TEACHER TOOK HER TO HEADQUARTERS CAROL NEVER BECAME A PROMINENT SUFFRAGIST
THOUGH IT ABSORBED MOST OF HER SALARY AN EXCELLENT NURSE FOR HUGH SHE HERSELF PUT HIM TO BED AND PLAYED WITH HIM ON HOLIDAYS THERE WERE WALKS WITH HIM THERE WERE MOTIONLESS EVENINGS OF READING BUT CHIEFLY WASHINGTON WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE
A WESTERN MINING SETTLEMENT LIKE A TUMOR A BOOMING SEMI CITY WITH PARKS AND CLEVER ARCHITECTS VISITED BY FAMOUS PIANISTS AND UNCTUOUS LECTURERS BUT IRRITABLE FROM A STRUGGLE BETWEEN UNION LABOR AND THE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
THE LINES ARE BROKEN AND UNCERTAIN OF DIRECTION OFTEN INSTEAD OF RISING THEY SINK IN WAVERING SCRAWLS AND THE COLORS ARE WATERY BLUE AND PINK AND THE DIM GRAY OF RUBBED PENCIL MARKS A FEW LINES ARE TRACEABLE
UNHAPPY WOMEN ARE GIVEN TO PROTECTING THEIR SENSITIVENESS BY CYNICAL GOSSIP BY WHINING BY HIGH CHURCH AND NEW THOUGHT RELIGIONS OR BY A FOG OF VAGUENESS CAROL HAD HIDDEN IN NONE OF THESE REFUGES FROM REALITY
CHAPTER SEVEN JOHNNY CHUCK JOINS THE CLASS
IT WASN'T FOR YOUR BENEFIT THAT I SENT WORD FOR YOU TO BE HERE THIS MORNING IT WAS FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS NOW SIT UP SO THAT ALL CAN GET A GOOD LOOK AT YOU
DOWN A LITTLE WAY THE TUNNEL GREW SMALLER AND THEN REMAINED THE SAME SIZE ALL THE REST OF THE WAY WAY DOWN AT THE FARTHER END WAS A NICE LITTLE BEDROOM WITH SOME GRASS IN IT THERE WERE ONE OR TWO OTHER LITTLE ROOMS
AND THERE WERE TWO BRANCH TUNNELS LEADING UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND MAKING SIDE OR BACK DOORWAYS THERE WAS NO SAND AROUND EITHER OF THESE AND THEY WERE QUITE HIDDEN BY THE LONG GRASS HANGING OVER THEM
AND TO MORROW I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THEM IF YOU WANT ME TO
THE DAY WITH THE WIFE OF THE WORTHY GENTLEMAN WHO IS RECEIVING US WHO IS HE
HIS BANKER DANGLARS IS HIS BANKER IS HE NOT ASKED CHATEAU RENAUD OF DEBRAY I BELIEVE SO REPLIED THE SECRETARY WITH SLIGHT UNEASINESS BUT MONTE CRISTO IS NOT THE ONLY ONE I MISS HERE I DO NOT SEE MORREL
STILL HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HERE SAID DEBRAY I WONDER WHAT WILL BE TALKED ABOUT TO NIGHT THIS FUNERAL IS THE NEWS OF THE DAY BUT HUSH HERE COMES OUR MINISTER OF JUSTICE
FOR INDEED MISFORTUNE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF MY HOUSE WHEN I PERCEIVED YOU I WAS JUST ASKING MYSELF WHETHER I HAD NOT WISHED HARM TOWARDS THOSE POOR MORCERFS WHICH WOULD HAVE JUSTIFIED THE PROVERB OF
AND THEN MYSELF COVERED WITH RIDICULE THROUGH THE VILLANY OF BENEDETTO BESIDES BESIDES WHAT ASKED THE COUNT ALAS DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT NEW CALAMITY MY DAUGHTER
NO WITH A RELATION BUT STILL WE HAVE QUITE LOST OUR DEAR EUGENIE FOR I DOUBT WHETHER HER PRIDE WILL EVER ALLOW HER TO RETURN TO FRANCE STILL BARON SAID MONTE CRISTO
THAT MONEY MITIGATES MANY TRIALS AND IF YOU ADMIT THE EFFICACY OF THIS SOVEREIGN BALM YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY EASILY CONSOLED YOU THE KING OF FINANCE THE FOCUS OF IMMEASURABLE POWER
THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE DURING WHICH THE NOISE OF THE BANKER'S PEN WAS ALONE HEARD WHILE MONTE CRISTO EXAMINED THE GILT MOULDINGS ON THE CEILING ARE THEY SPANISH HAITIAN
BUT DID YOU RECEIVE MY LETTER YESTERDAY YES I HAVE BROUGHT MY RECEIPT
FIVE MILLIONS HERE IS HIS RECEIPT BELIEVE YOUR OWN EYES
FROM TWELVE TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS BUT TO RETURN TO OUR MILLIONS
AH YOU ARE LAUGHING AT ME SEND TO MORROW AT TWELVE AND THE BANK SHALL BE NOTIFIED I WILL COME MYSELF BETTER STILL SINCE IT WILL AFFORD ME THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU THEY SHOOK HANDS
NO SAID THE BANKER I HAVE APPEARED RATHER RIDICULOUS SINCE THAT AFFAIR OF BENEDETTO SO I REMAIN IN THE BACKGROUND BAH YOU ARE WRONG HOW WERE YOU TO BLAME IN THAT AFFAIR
FOOL THEN ENCLOSING MONTE CRISTO'S RECEIPT IN A LITTLE POCKET BOOK HE ADDED YES COME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK I SHALL THEN BE FAR AWAY THEN HE DOUBLE LOCKED HIS DOOR EMPTIED ALL HIS DRAWERS COLLECTED ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS IN BANK NOTES
IN THE STREET THE LAMPS OF THE TAXI CABS SENT OUT GLISTENING SHEENS ALONG THE ALREADY BLACK PAVEMENT THE UNWELCOME NOVEMBER RAIN HAD PERVERSELY STOLEN THE DAY'S LAST HOUR AND PAWNED IT WITH THAT ANCIENT FENCE THE NIGHT
THAT DEPRESSED HIM WITH ITS HEAVY ODOR COMPOUNDED OF THE TOBACCO SMELL OF THE MEN AND THE FETID SENSUOUSNESS OF STALE POWDER ON WOMEN AFTER THE THICK CROWD CAME ANOTHER SCATTERING A STRAY HALF DOZEN A MAN ON CRUTCHES
AND THE NUMEROUS UNPLEASANT ASPECTS OF CITY LIFE WITHOUT MONEY OCCURRED TO HIM IN THREATENING PROCESSION THERE WAS THE GHASTLY STINKING CRUSH OF THE SUBWAY THE CAR CARDS THRUSTING THEMSELVES AT ONE LEERING OUT LIKE DULL BORES WHO GRAB YOUR ARM WITH ANOTHER STORY
THE QUERULOUS WORRY AS TO WHETHER SOME ONE ISN'T LEANING ON YOU A MAN DECIDING NOT TO GIVE HIS SEAT TO A WOMAN HATING HER FOR IT THE WOMAN HATING HIM FOR NOT DOING IT AT WORST A SQUALID PHANTASMAGORIA OF BREATH
HOW THE SMELL OF IT HAD SUDDENLY CLEARED THE AIR AND GIVEN EVERY ONE IN THE CAR A MOMENTARY GLOW I DETEST POOR PEOPLE THOUGHT AMORY SUDDENLY I HATE THEM FOR BEING POOR POVERTY MAY HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL ONCE BUT IT'S ROTTEN NOW
NEVER ANY MORE DID HE REPROACH HIMSELF FOR FEELINGS THAT WERE NATURAL AND SINCERE HE ACCEPTED ALL HIS REACTIONS AS A PART OF HIM UNCHANGEABLE UNMORAL THIS PROBLEM OF POVERTY TRANSFORMED MAGNIFIED ATTACHED TO SOME GRANDER
I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO
NO I AM MERELY AFRAID OF BEING POOR QUESTION VERY AFRAID
RATHER I DON'T WANT TO COMMIT MORAL SUICIDE QUESTION HAVE YOU NO INTERESTS LEFT
NOT NECESSARILY QUESTION WHAT WOULD BE THE TEST OF CORRUPTION
THEY DON'T THEY JUST WANT THE FUN OF EATING IT ALL OVER AGAIN THE MATRON DOESN'T WANT TO REPEAT HER GIRLHOOD SHE WANTS TO REPEAT HER HONEYMOON
WONDER WHAT HUMBIRD'S BODY LOOKED LIKE NOW IF HE HIMSELF HADN'T BEEN BAYONET INSTRUCTOR HE'D HAVE GONE UP TO LINE THREE MONTHS SOONER PROBABLY BEEN KILLED WHERE'S THE DARNED BELL
DO YOU SAY TO YOURSELF THIS PRISON MAY BE OUR TOMB TOMB PERHAPS STILL I WOULD NOT CHANGE IT FOR MAHOMET'S WHICH FLOATS IN SPACE BUT NEVER ADVANCES AN INCH
MURCHISON WILL LAUNCH THE ELECTRIC SPARK ON THE WIRE WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHARGE OF THE COLUMBIAD AT THAT PRECISE MOMENT WE SHALL LEAVE OUR SPHEROID THUS WE STILL HAVE TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO REMAIN ON THE EARTH
FOR SOME MOMENTS THE THREE TRAVELERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER THEN THEY BEGAN TO EXAMINE THE OBJECTS IMPRISONED WITH THEM EVERYTHING IS IN ITS PLACE SAID BARBICANE
WE MIGHT WELL ASK OURSELVES OF WHAT MATERIALS ARE THE HEARTS OF THESE AMERICANS MADE TO WHOM THE APPROACH OF THE MOST FRIGHTFUL DANGER ADDED NO PULSATION
THREE THICK AND SOLIDLY MADE COUCHES HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE PROJECTILE NICHOLL AND BARBICANE PLACED THEM IN THE CENTER OF THE DISC FORMING THE FLOOR
THERE THE THREE TRAVELERS WERE TO STRETCH THEMSELVES SOME MOMENTS BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE DURING THIS TIME ARDAN NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP STILL TURNED IN HIS NARROW PRISON LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE
I ONLY ASK TO BE ALLOWED TO PAY COME NICHOLL I SEE THAT YOU ARE A MAN OF METHOD WHICH I COULD NEVER BE BUT INDEED YOU HAVE MADE A SERIES OF BETS OF VERY LITTLE ADVANTAGE TO YOURSELF ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU
SAID BARBICANE IN A SERIOUS VOICE LET US PREPARE
THE ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT PAYS NEARLY ALL EXPENSES OF THIS WHOLE SYSTEM OF JOURNALISM ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR PRIVATE GAIN ARE PAID AT A REGULAR RATE IT COSTS MORE TO ADVERTISE AT CERTAIN PERIODS THAN AT OTHER TIMES
WHEN AN EXCHANGE OF SEATS IS NECESSARY IT IS ALL DONE SO EASILY AND SO QUICKLY THAT YOU WOULD WONDER WHY WE TOLERATE TROLLEY CARS IN TRAVELING FROM CITY TO CITY A SYSTEM IS IN USE THAT I WILL CALL THE TOBOGGAN SLIDE SYSTEM
PUBLIC HIGHWAYS THESE INTERESTING PEOPLE EXCEL US IN THEIR STYLE AND MANNER OF HOME BUILDING FENCING AND MAKING PUBLIC HIGHWAYS WE ARE HEATHENISH IN OUR PROGRESS ALONG THE LINE OF ROAD MAKING ESPECIALLY
AND THAT HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD LOSE THE THRONE OF CIVIL POWER THAT THEY WOULD BE TESTED FOR A SEASON IN THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION AND BY THE FIRES OF TERRIBLE PERSECUTION AND THAT THEY WHO WOULD ENDURE UNTO THE END WOULD BE GLORIFIED
THEN THE MARKS ON THE GROUND AT THE POINT FROM WHICH HE HAD FALLEN AND THE L B WERE HERE JUST AS HE REMEMBERED BUT NOT FAR FROM THE SMALL SHIP HE HAD DISCOVERED SOMETHING MORE A CAMPSITE WITH A SHELTER FASHIONED OUT OF SPALLS AND VINES
RYNCH BEGAN TO HOPE IT HAD ONLY BEEN DEFENDING ITS OWN HIDING PLACE FOR ITS PRESENT ATTITUDE SUGGESTED CONCEALMENT STILL FACING THAT FEATURELESS BLOB IN THE TREE THE MAN RETREATED ALERT FOR THE FIRST SIGN OF ADVANCE ON THE PART OF THE CREATURE ABOVE
NONE CAME AND HE DARED TO SLIP AROUND THE BOLE OF THE TREE UNDER WHICH HE STOOD LISTENING INTENTLY FOR ANY CORRESPONDING MOVEMENT OVERHEAD NOW HE WAS FACING THAT SURVIVOR'S CAMP
BUT THEY NO LONGER GATHERED IN STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LIGHT HIS PRESENCE NOW HE COULD SEE THEY DRIFTED ABOUT THE VEGETATION ABOUT THE LOG WHERE THE MAN SAT ABOUT ROCKS AND REEDS ONLY THEY WERE THICKER ABOUT THE STRANGER AS IF HIS BODY WERE A MAGNET
CLAWED AT THE GROUND ABOUT HIM ALREADY HE WAS BURIED TO HIS KNEES THEN HIS MID THIGHS IN THE ARTIFICIAL QUICKSAND BUT HE HAD NOT LOST HIS HEAD AND WAS JERKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN AN EFFORT TO PULL FREE RYNCH GOT TO HIS FEET
SUPPOSE RYNCH'S VOICE WAS RUSTY SOUNDING IN HIS OWN EARS WE TALK NOW THE MAN NODDED
I WILL GIVE YOU LETTERS TO CONDE AND RECOLLECT THAT WHATEVER GENERAL YOU TAKE SERVICE UNDER YOU WILL FOLLOW HIM WITHOUT PRETENDING TO CALCULATE HOW FAR HIS MOVEMENTS MAY BE RIGHT OR WRONG THAT IS NOT YOUR AFFAIR
CONDE OBTAINED THE VICTORY AT BLENAN AND IN APRIL SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO ADVANCED TO PARIS TURENNE WHO HAD TAKEN THE COMMAND OF THE FRENCH ARMY FOLLOWED HIM
AND NOT RECEIVING THE ASSISTANCE HE EXPECTED FROM THE SPANIARDS HE FELL BACK TO THE FRONTIERS OF CHAMPAGNE PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE FROM PARIS EDWARD HAD RECEIVED HUMPHREY'S LETTER EXPLAINING AWAY THE INTENDANT'S CONDUCT
HE WROTE A LETTER TO THE INTENDANT THANKING HIM FOR HIS KIND FEELINGS AND INTENTIONS TOWARD HIM AND HE TRUSTED THAT HE MIGHT ONE DAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HIM AGAIN HE DID NOT HOWEVER THINK IT ADVISABLE TO MENTION THE NAME OF HIS DAUGHTER
AFTER THE PEACE AND THE PARDON OF CONDE BY THE FRENCH KING THE ARMIES WERE DISBANDED AND THE THREE ADVENTURERS WERE FREE THEY TOOK THEIR LEAVE OF THE PRINCE WHO THANKED THEM FOR THEIR LONG AND MERITORIOUS SERVICES
THEY ARE THY SISTERS ALICE AND EDITH
WHICH IT GAVE TO EDWARD TO FIND HIS SISTERS GROWN SUCH ACCOMPLISHED AND ELEGANT YOUNG WOMEN THAT HIS TWO FRIENDS WHO WERE AS THE READER WILL RECOLLECT OLD ACQUAINTANCES OF ALICE AND EDITH WERE WARMLY RECEIVED WE HARDLY NEED SAY
WITH HER TO DAY WHEN DID YOU HEAR FROM HUMPHREY EDITH A FEW DAYS BACK HE HAS LEFT THE COTTAGE NOW ALTOGETHER INDEED WHERE DOES HE RESIDE THEN AT ARNWOOD THE HOUSE HAS BEEN REBUILT
AND I UNDERSTAND IS A VERY PRINCELY MANSION HUMPHREY HAS CHARGE OF IT UNTIL IT IS ASCERTAINED TO WHOM IT IS TO BELONG IT BELONGS TO MISTER HEATHERSTONE DOES IT NOT REPLIED EDWARD
HOW CAN YOU SAY SO EDWARD YOU RECEIVED HUMPHREY'S LETTERS A LONG WHILE AGO YES I DID BUT LET US NOT TALK ABOUT IT ANY MORE MY DEAR EDITH I AM IN GREAT PERPLEXITY
WHAT IS YOUR PERPLEXITY WELL REPLIED EDWARD SINCE IT IS TO BE SO LET US SIT DOWN AND TALK OVER THE MATTER I ACKNOWLEDGE THE KINDNESS OF MISTER HEATHERSTONE
AT ALL EVENTS EDWARD RECOLLECT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARE THE INTENTIONS OF MISTER HEATHERSTONE WAIT AND SEE WHAT HE PROFFERS FIRST BUT MY DEAR SISTER IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE EVIDENT
AND I THEREFORE SAY AGAIN MY DEAR EDWARD MAKE NO APPLICATION TILL YOU ASCERTAIN WHAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE'S INTENTIONS MAY BE YOUR ADVICE IS GOOD MY DEAR ALICE AND I WILL BE GUIDED BY IT REPLIED EDWARD
THOSE WHO HOLD THE PROPERTY THINK SO TOO AND SO FAR IT IS FORTUNATE NOW FROM WISER HEADS THAN MINE
AND WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF HIS SISTERS CHALONER AND GRENVILLE WERE NOT WITH HIM THEY HAD OBTAINED LEAVE TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE OBJECT WE HAVE BEFORE REFERRED TO WHEN HIS EYES CAUGHT ADVANCING TOWARD THE KING
MISTER HEATHERSTONE WHO LED HIS DAUGHTER PATIENCE THAT THEY HAD NOT PERCEIVED HIM WAS EVIDENT INDEED HER EYES WERE NOT RAISED ONCE FROM THE NATURAL TIMIDITY FELT BY A YOUNG WOMAN IN THE PRESENCE OF ROYALTY
IT IS NOW SEVEN YEARS SINCE YOU QUITTED THE FOREST AND IN YOUR LETTERS TO MISTER HEATHERSTONE YOU MADE NO REMARK UPON WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN YOU AND PATIENCE SINCE THAT YOU HAVE NEVER CORRESPONDED OR SENT ANY MESSAGES
AND YOU CAN HARDLY EXPECT THAT A GIRL FROM THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR WILL CHERISH THE IMAGE OF ONE WHO TO SAY THE LEAST HAD TREATED HER WITH INDIFFERENCE THAT IS MY VIEW OF THE MATTER EDWARD IT MAY BE WRONG
NAY EDWARD RECOLLECT THAT I HAVE AS EDITH OBSERVED PASSED MY LIFE IN THE WOODS EDWARD WAS MOST KINDLY RECEIVED BY MISTER HEATHERSTONE EDWARD
CLAIMED BY AN ELDERLY RELATION WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTRY AND WHOSE INFIRM STATE OF HEALTH DID NOT PERMIT HIM TO QUIT THE HOUSE HE LEFT HIS PROPERTY TO CLARA ABOUT A YEAR AFTER HER MARRIAGE TO HUMPHREY
OF COURSE SOCIETY HAS TO BE SURE THAT NO POSSIBLE MISUSE AND DAMAGE ARE TO RESULT FROM SUCH PRACTICE FEARS IN THAT DIRECTION HAVE BEEN UTTERED REPEATEDLY BUT FROM VERY DIFFERENT STANDPOINTS
BUT IF WE WERE TO STRIKE OUT ALL SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCES FROM SOCIAL LIFE WE SHOULD GIVE UP SOCIAL LIFE ITSELF SUGGESTION IS GIVEN WHEREVER MEN COME IN CONTACT IN ITSELF IT IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD THE GOOD RESOLUTION AND THE BAD ONE CAN BE SUGGESTED
BELONGING THEREFORE ENTIRELY TO THE PURPOSIVE VIEW OF THE MIND BUT WE HAVE NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE IT IS OUR DUTY TO DO JUSTICE TO THIS PURPOSIVE VIEW TOO AS LONG AS WE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM ENTIRELY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PHYSICIAN
AS NO STRONGER NATURAL DESIRE AND NO MORAL OBJECTION STAND IN THE WAY HE CARRIES OUT THAT MEANINGLESS IMPULSE AND PERHAPS EVEN INVENTS A FOOLISH MOTIVE TO EXPLAIN TO HIMSELF WHY HE WANTED TO LOOK AT THAT BOOK
EVERY SUGGESTION HAS TO RELY ON THE EFFORTS AND STRUGGLES OF THE PATIENT HIMSELF AND ALL THAT THE PSYCHOTHERAPISTS CAN GIVE HIM IS HELP IN HIS OWN MORAL FIGHT HIS OWN WILL IS PRESUPPOSITION FOR BEING HYPNOTIZED
IN TRUTH IT WAS THE RESULT OF FOUR MONTHS OF THE MOST NOBLE AND COURAGEOUS SUFFERING AND STRUGGLING HE HAD BEEN FOR YEARS A SLAVE TO HIS PASSION TO QUOTE FROM HIS LITTLE AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHEN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ADDICTED TO MORPHINE
I WAS CUT OFF BY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION HALF A GRAIN AND THIS PUT ME TO FIGHTING THE DESIRE AGAIN
HE WAS THUS AT EVERY MOMENT DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE DEADLY POISON WITH WHICH HE COULD HAVE FULLY SATISFIED HIS CRAVING IT WAS A MORAL VICTORY WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH HE WENT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
AND FINALLY PRESENTED THE REMAINING TABLETS TO A HOSPITAL AND YET THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE LEAST CHANCE FOR HIS WINNING THIS ETHICAL VICTORY WITHOUT THE OUTER HELP OF THE HYPNOTIST WE DO NOT ELIMINATE THE MORAL WILL BUT WE REMOVE SOME UNFAIR OBSTACLES FROM ITS PATH
OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED FOR ITS SKILLFUL USE TO HYPNOTIZE OR TO PERFORM ANY PERSISTENT PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT MAY THUS BE DANGEROUS IF IT IS DONE BY THE UNFIT
EVEN WHERE SOUND RELIGION WITHOUT SUPERSTITION AND WITHOUT PSEUDOPHILOSOPHY STANDS BEHIND THE THERAPEUTIC WORK THE COMMUNITY WILL NOT GIVE UP THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CHURCH DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEGLECT BY IT THE INTERESTS WHICH ARE SUPERIOR
BOTH EDUCATORS AND CRIMINOLOGISTS HAVE INDEED OFTEN RAISED SUCH QUESTIONS AND SOCIAL REFORMERS HAVE NOT SELDOM SEEN THERE WIDE PERSPECTIVES FOR SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN FUTURE TIMES
WHEREVER A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF OWN WILL FORCE AND ATTENTION CAN BE EXPECTED TO OVERCOME THE ANTAGONISTIC INFLUENCE THERE ARTIFICIAL HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE AVOIDED EVERYTHING OUGHT TO BE LEFT IN THAT CASE TO SUGGESTIONS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS
I HAVE STEADILY REFUSED REQUESTS OF STUDENTS AND OTHERS TO USE HYPNOTISM FOR THE PURPOSE OF OVERCOMING MERELY BAD HABITS SUCH AS THE HABIT OF BITING THE NAILS A CHILD WHO FINDS SOME DIFFICULTY IN STICKING SERIOUSLY TO HIS TASKS MIGHT LEARN NOW THIS
OF SUPPRESSING AN UGLY TENDENCY BY HIS OWN EFFORT ALL THAT FINDS ITS LIMITS WHERE THE INHIBITIONS OR OBSTACLES IN THE BRAIN OF THE CHILD ARE TOO STRONG POSSIBLY TO BE OVERCOME BY THE OWN GOOD WILL BUT IN THAT CASE
PSYCHOTHERAPY HAS ITS RIGHT THE FEEBLE MINDED AND THE RETARDED CHILD THE PERVERSE CHILD AND THE EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE CHILD BELONG UNDER THE CARE OF THE PHYSICIAN
AND IF THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH A PROPOSAL IS RECOGNIZED IT SEEMS TO MANY JUSTIFIED TO DEMAND SUCH AN INTRUSION AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THE BORN CRIMINAL EVEN IF THE OCCASIONAL CRIMINAL CANNOT BE REACHED
ON HIS WAY THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST HE PASSED A CERTAIN TREE HE WAS JUST PAST AND NO MORE WHEN A FAMILIAR VOICE HAILED HIM
WHAT'S YO HURRY PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND LOOKED UP IN THAT TREE THERE PEERING DOWN AT HIM FROM A HOLE HIGH UP IN THE TRUNK WAS A SHARP WHITISH GRAY FACE
MISTER OPOSSUM BUT PETER WASN'T LISTENING THE FACT IS PETER HAD STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR SCHOOL WITHOUT EVEN BEING POLITE ENOUGH TO SAY GOOD BY HE ARRIVED AT SCHOOL QUITE OUT OF BREATH
NOW HAVE I MADE IT QUITE CLEAR WHY ALTHOUGH THEY EAT FLESH UNC BILLY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE SAME BIG ORDER AS BUSTER BEAR AND THE OTHER FLESH EATERS EVERYBODY NODDED
UNC BILLY GRINNED AND GOOD NATUREDLY STARTED UP A TREE HE CREPT OUT ON A BRANCH THAT OVERHUNG ANOTHER BRANCH WAY OUT WHERE THE BRANCH WAS SMALL CREPT UNC BILLY
BUT NONE OF THEM CAN DO IT AS WELL AS UNC BILLY POSSUM PRETENDING TO BE DEAD IN ORDER TO REMAIN ALIVE IS THE CLEVEREST THING UNC BILLY DOES
HE COULD NOT TELL WHAT NAME THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TO RECUR OF SOME QUEER LONG FORGOTTEN SENSATION OF VEIN AND MUSCLE OF A FEELING OF VAST HOPELESS EFFORT
IT WENT UP BEYOND THE TOP OF HIS EYES HE TRIED TO THINK WHERE HE MIGHT BE DID IT MATTER SEEING HE WAS SO WRETCHED
THE MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD INVOLVED A PERCEPTION OF EXTREME PHYSICAL WEAKNESS HE SUPPOSED HE WAS IN BED IN THE HOTEL AT THE PLACE IN THE VALLEY BUT HE COULD NOT RECALL THAT WHITE EDGE HE MUST HAVE SLEPT
ABOUT HIS ARM AND HE SAW WITH A SHOCK THAT HIS SKIN WAS STRANGELY DRY AND YELLOW WAS BOUND A CURIOUS APPARATUS OF RUBBER BOUND SO CUNNINGLY
A COUPLE OF GRACEFUL CHAIRS AND ON THE TABLE A NUMBER OF DISHES WITH SUBSTANCES PILED ON THEM A BOTTLE AND TWO GLASSES HE REALISED THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HUNGRY HE COULD SEE NO ONE
THE APARTMENT LOST NONE OF ITS SIZE AND MAGNIFICENCE NOW THAT THE GREENISH TRANSPARENCY THAT HAD INTERVENED WAS REMOVED THE ARCHWAY HE SAW LED TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS GOING DOWNWARD WITHOUT THE INTERMEDIATION OF A DOOR
AND VOICES AND A DEEP UNDEVIATING DRONING NOTE HE SAT NOW FULLY AWAKE LISTENING ALERTLY FORGETTING THE VIANDS IN HIS ATTENTION
WERE VAST AND VAGUE ARCHITECTURAL FORMS THE TUMULT OF VOICES ROSE NOW LOUD AND CLEAR AND ON THE BALCONY AND WITH THEIR BACKS TO HIM GESTICULATING AND APPARENTLY IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION
THE TOP OF A BANNER PASSED AND ONCE SOME BRIGHTLY COLOURED OBJECT A PALE BLUE CAP OR GARMENT THROWN UP INTO THE AIR PERHAPS FLASHED ATHWART THE SPACE AND FELL THE SHOUTS SOUNDED LIKE ENGLISH

HE HAD THE HABIT OF SELF ENGROSSED SILENCES
HE POURED BITTER AND BITING RIDICULE ON HIS DISCOMFITED OPPONENTS HE SPOKE WITH SLEDGEHAMMER DIRECTNESS
I WAS EXTREMELY PERPLEXED I WILL PERMIT MYSELF THE LIBERTY OF SAYING I WOULD FAIN BELIEVE

AT DINNER IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE FAMOUS TARANTELLA WOULD BE DANCED IN THE LOWER HALL OF THE HOTEL AT NINE O'CLOCK AND THE GIRLS TOLD UNCLE JOHN THAT THEY MUST NOT MISS THIS FAMOUS SIGHT WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE IN SORRENTO OR INDEED IN ALL ITALY
A GOODLY AUDIENCE HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN THE ROOM AND AMONG THEM THE GIRL SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE AN ACQUAINTANCE FOR AFTER A BRIEF HESITATION SHE ADVANCED AND PLACED HER HAND IN THAT OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD RISEN ON HER ENTRANCE AND HASTENED TOWARD HER
THAT I CANNOT TELL YOU SIGNOR MERRICK OH PERHAPS YOU KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE NOBILITY OF YOUR COUNTRY I I KNOW LITTLE OF THE NOBILITY ANSWERED FLORIANO INDIGNANTLY
AND THAT IS RIGHT SIR WAS THE PROMPT REPLY ALLOW ME TO OFFER YOU MY CARD UNCLE JOHN TOOK THE CARD AND READ CONTE LEONARDI FERRALTI MILANO ITALIA
HE CAREFULLY PLACED THE CARD IN HIS POCKET BOOK THANK YOU SAID HE IT'S A FINE MORNING COUNT CHARMING MISTER MERRICK UNCLE JOHN WALKED AWAY HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD NOT SUSPECTED THE YOUNG MAN UNJUSTLY
BUT LOUISE COULD NOT BE MADE HAPPY SHE FLEW INTO HALF INSANE FITS OF TEMPER DURING WHICH SHE WAS SOMETIMES SILENT SOMETIMES NOISY AND QUARRELSOME SHE SWORE AND CRIED OUT IN HER ANGER SHE GOT A KNIFE FROM THE KITCHEN AND THREATENED HER HUSBAND'S LIFE
HE WAS TOO YOUNG THEN TO HAVE OPINIONS OF HIS OWN ABOUT PEOPLE BUT AT TIMES IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM NOT TO HAVE VERY DEFINITE OPINIONS ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO WAS HIS MOTHER DAVID WAS ALWAYS A QUIET ORDERLY BOY
WHEN HE HEARD HIS MOTHER SPOKEN OF HARSHLY OR WHEN HE OVERHEARD HER BERATING HIS FATHER HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND RAN AWAY TO HIDE SOMETIMES HE COULD NOT FIND A HIDING PLACE AND THAT CONFUSED HIM
HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND TRIED NOT TO THINK OF ANYTHING HE HAD A HABIT OF TALKING ALOUD TO HIMSELF AND EARLY IN LIFE A SPIRIT OF QUIET SADNESS OFTEN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM ON THE OCCASIONS WHEN DAVID WENT TO VISIT HIS GRANDFATHER ON THE BENTLEY FARM
THE DARKNESS ABOUT HIM SEEMED LIMITLESS THE SOUND OF THE WIND BLOWING IN TREES WAS TERRIFYING WHEN A TEAM OF HORSES APPROACHED ALONG THE ROAD IN WHICH HE WALKED HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND CLIMBED A FENCE THROUGH A FIELD HE RAN UNTIL HE CAME
THE MOST PEACEFUL AND LOVELY THING HE HAD EVER SEEN
AND SO YOUNG DAVID WENT TO LIVE IN THE BENTLEY FARMHOUSE WITH JESSE TWO OF THE OLD FARMER'S SISTERS WERE ALIVE AND STILL LIVED IN THE HOUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF JESSE AND RARELY SPOKE WHEN HE WAS ABOUT
BEGAN TO THINK THAT AT LAST HIS PRAYERS HAD BEEN ANSWERED ALTHOUGH HE WAS AT THAT TIME ONLY FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD HE LOOKED SEVENTY AND WAS WORN OUT WITH MUCH THINKING AND SCHEMING
AND THE STARS CAME OUT IT WAS HARDER TO GET BACK THE OLD FEELING OF A CLOSE AND PERSONAL GOD WHO LIVED IN THE SKY OVERHEAD AND WHO MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT REACH OUT HIS HAND TOUCH HIM ON THE SHOULDER
WHEN HE HAD FIRST COME OUT OF THE CITY TO LIVE ON THE LAND
THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE BOY AND MAN ON THEIR KNEES IN SOME LONELY SPOT IN THE FOREST WOULD MAKE THE MIRACLE HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR ALMOST INEVITABLE
HE CLIMBED OVER A FALLEN LOG AND WHEN HE HAD COME TO AN OPEN PLACE AMONG THE TREES HE DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES AND BEGAN TO PRAY IN A LOUD VOICE A KIND OF TERROR HE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE TOOK POSSESSION OF DAVID
THE MAN DID NOT LOOK LIKE HIS GRANDFATHER THE CONVICTION THAT SOMETHING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE HAD HAPPENED THAT BY SOME MIRACLE A NEW AND DANGEROUS PERSON HAD COME INTO THE BODY OF THE KINDLY OLD MAN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
WITH A LUMINOUS NETWORK WHAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THESE SPARKLING RAYS WHICH SHONE ON THE PLAINS AS WELL AS ON THE RELIEFS AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY MIGHT BE ALL STARTED FROM A COMMON CENTER THE CRATER
BY JOVE REPLIED MICHEL ARDAN
SEEMED TO US TO MOVE ON THE MOON'S SURFACE
RELATIVELY THE ORGANIZING FORCE OF MATTER HAS BEEN MUCH MORE VIOLENT IN THE INTERIOR OF THE MOON THAN IN THE INTERIOR OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE THE ACTUAL STATE OF THIS CRACKED TWISTED AND BURST DISC ABUNDANTLY PROVES THIS
VAPOR DEPOSITED ITSELF IN THE SHAPE OF CLOUDS THIS NATURAL SCREEN TEMPERED THE ARDOR OF THE SOLAR RAYS AND RETAINED THE NOCTURNAL RADIATION
AND THE INCANDESCENT MATTER CONCENTRATED ITSELF THE LUNAR CRUST COOLED BY DEGREES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PHENOMENA SHOWED THEMSELVES IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ORGANIZED BEINGS AND BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF VEGETATION SOON THE ATMOSPHERE WAS RAREFIED
AND HAVE THEY CALCULATED THE TIME WHICH OUR UNFORTUNATE SPHERE WILL TAKE TO COOL CERTAINLY AND YOU KNOW THESE CALCULATIONS PERFECTLY
BUT AS SURE AS HE FOUND A PRINCESS HE FOUND SOME FAULT IN HER OF COURSE HE COULD NOT MARRY A MERE WOMAN HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL AND THERE WAS NO PRINCESS TO BE FOUND WORTHY OF HIM
WHETHER THE PRINCE WAS SO NEAR PERFECTION THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO DEMAND PERFECTION ITSELF I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE WAS A FINE HANDSOME
FOR THE HATCHING OF A REAL HEARTY LAUGH REQUIRES THE INCUBATION OF GRAVITY AND PERHAPS THIS WAS HOW THE PRINCE MISTOOK THE LAUGHTER FOR SCREAMING LOOKING OVER THE LAKE HE SAW SOMETHING WHITE IN THE WATER AND IN AN INSTANT HE HAD TORN OFF HIS TUNIC
I PITY YOU THE PRINCE NOW SAW THAT HE HAD COME UPON THE BEWITCHED PRINCESS AND HAD ALREADY OFFENDED HER BUT BEFORE HE COULD THINK WHAT TO SAY NEXT SHE BURST OUT ANGRILY GIVING A STAMP WITH HER FOOT
FOR HER ANGER MADE HER MORE CHARMING THAN ANY ONE ELSE HAD EVER BEHELD HER AND AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE WHICH CERTAINLY WAS NOT FAR SHE HAD NOT A SINGLE FAULT ABOUT HER EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT SHE HAD NOT ANY GRAVITY
VERY WELL SAID THE PRINCE AND CATCHING HER UP IN HIS ARMS HE SPRANG WITH HER FROM THE ROCK THE PRINCESS HAD JUST TIME TO GIVE ONE DELIGHTED SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER BEFORE THE WATER CLOSED OVER THEM
I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER BUT I DON'T CARE AT ALL EVENTS AS WE HAVE FALLEN IN LET US HAVE A SWIM TOGETHER WITH ALL MY HEART RESPONDED THE PRINCE
AND AWAY THEY WENT SWIMMING AND DIVING AND FLOATING UNTIL AT LAST THEY HEARD CRIES ALONG THE SHORE AND SAW LIGHTS GLANCING IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS NOW QUITE LATE AND THERE WAS NO MOON I MUST GO HOME SAID THE PRINCESS
AT LEAST I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHERE IT IS I WISH I HADN'T ONE EITHER REJOINED THE PRINCESS IT IS SO STUPID I HAVE A GREAT MIND SHE CONTINUED TO PLAY THEM ALL A TRICK WHY COULDN'T THEY LEAVE ME ALONE
THEY WON'T TRUST ME IN THE LAKE FOR A SINGLE NIGHT YOU SEE WHERE THAT GREEN LIGHT IS BURNING THAT IS THE WINDOW OF MY ROOM NOW IF YOU WOULD JUST SWIM THERE WITH ME VERY QUIETLY AND WHEN WE ARE ALL BUT UNDER THE BALCONY
THE PRINCE LOOKED AT THE HOLE AND SAW BUT ONE WAY HE PUT BOTH HIS LEGS INTO IT SITTING ON THE STONE AND STOOPING FORWARD COVERED THE CORNER THAT REMAINED OPEN WITH HIS TWO HANDS IN THIS UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION
AND A LONG PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU PRINCE SAID THE PRINCESS AT LAST QUITE COOLLY AS SHE LAY IN THE BOAT WITH HER EYES SHUT I AM SORRY I CAN'T RETURN THE COMPLIMENT
THOUGHT THE PRINCE BUT YOU ARE WORTH DYING FOR AFTER ALL AGAIN A WAVELET AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED BOTH THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK OR MOVE
TWO THREE FOUR HOURS PASSED IN THIS WAY THE PRINCESS APPARENTLY ASLEEP AND THE PRINCE VERY PATIENT BUT HE WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED IN HIS POSITION FOR HE HAD NONE OF THE CONSOLATION HE HAD HOPED FOR
AND SHE BEGAN AT ONCE TO FEED HIM WITH BITS OF BISCUIT AND SIPS OF WINE AS SHE FED HIM HE CONTRIVED TO KISS THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS NOW AND THEN SHE DID NOT SEEM TO MIND IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT THE PRINCE FELT BETTER
ANSWERED SHE WITH CONDESCENSION AND SITTING DOWN SHE DID LOOK AT HIM AND KEPT LOOKING AT HIM WITH WONDERFUL STEADINESS CONSIDERING ALL THINGS THE SUN WENT DOWN AND THE MOON ROSE
YES I WILL ANSWERED THE PRINCESS AND KISSED HIM WITH A LONG SWEET COLD KISS NOW SAID HE WITH A SIGH OF CONTENT I DIE HAPPY
HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN THE PRINCESS GAVE HIM SOME WINE FOR THE LAST TIME HE WAS PAST EATING THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND LOOKED AT HIM THE WATER ROSE AND ROSE
AND THAT MADE HER THINK THAT HE COULD NOT GET ANY BREATH SHE WAS FRANTIC SHE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND HELD HIS HEAD ABOVE THE WATER WHICH WAS POSSIBLE NOW HIS HANDS WERE NO LONGER ON THE HOLE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE FOR HE WAS PAST BREATHING
BUT THE EXTREME IMPERTINENCE OF THE BARON DETERMINED HIM TO CONCLUDE THE MATCH
CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT
IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO
HA SAID PANGLOSS TO PAQUETTE PROVIDENCE HAS THEN BROUGHT YOU AMONGST US AGAIN MY POOR CHILD DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU COST ME THE TIP OF MY NOSE AN EYE AND AN EAR AS YOU MAY SEE WHAT A WORLD IS THIS
I CONTENT MYSELF WITH SENDING THERE FOR SALE THE FRUITS OF THE GARDEN WHICH I CULTIVATE HAVING SAID THESE WORDS HE INVITED THE STRANGERS INTO HIS HOUSE HIS TWO SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS PRESENTED THEM WITH SEVERAL SORTS OF SHERBET WHICH THEY MADE THEMSELVES
LET US WORK SAID MARTIN WITHOUT DISPUTING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO RENDER LIFE TOLERABLE THE WHOLE LITTLE SOCIETY ENTERED INTO THIS LAUDABLE DESIGN ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT ABILITIES THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
THERE IS A CONCATENATION OF EVENTS IN THIS BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS
IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN PUT INTO THE INQUISITION IF YOU HAD NOT WALKED OVER AMERICA IF YOU HAD NOT STABBED THE BARON IF YOU HAD NOT LOST ALL YOUR SHEEP FROM THE FINE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE EATING PRESERVED CITRONS AND PISTACHIO NUTS
THE DYING FIRES IN THE CLEARING CAST A DIM AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT ON THE DUSKY FIGURES THAT WERE SILENTLY STALKING TO AND FRO AND OCCASIONALLY A BRIGHTER GLEAM THAN COMMON GLANCED INTO THE LODGE AND EXHIBITED THE FIGURE OF UNCAS
AFTER THIS TERMINATION OF THE SCENE DUNCAN WANDERED AMONG THE LODGES UNQUESTIONED AND UNNOTICED ENDEAVORING TO FIND SOME TRACE OF HER IN WHOSE BEHALF HE INCURRED THE RISK HE RAN
HE WALKED INTO THE LODGE AND TOOK HIS SEAT WITH A GRAVITY THAT ACCORDED ADMIRABLY WITH THE DEPORTMENT OF HIS HOSTS A HASTY BUT SEARCHING GLANCE SUFFICED TO TELL HIM THAT THOUGH UNCAS STILL REMAINED WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIM
DAVID HAD NOT REAPPEARED NO OTHER RESTRAINT WAS IMPOSED ON THE FORMER THAN THE WATCHFUL LOOKS OF A YOUNG HURON WHO HAD PLACED HIMSELF AT HAND THOUGH AN ARMED WARRIOR LEANED AGAINST THE POST THAT FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE NARROW DOORWAY
I THANK HIM AN EVIL SPIRIT LIVES IN THE WIFE OF ONE OF MY YOUNG MEN CAN THE CUNNING STRANGER FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY HEYWARD POSSESSED SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE MUMMERY PRACTISED AMONG THE INDIANS
THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM MORE SATISFACTION AWARE OF THE NECESSITY OF PRESERVING THE DIGNITY OF HIS IMAGINARY CHARACTER HOWEVER HE REPRESSED HIS FEELINGS AND ANSWERED WITH SUITABLE MYSTERY SPIRITS DIFFER
DREW HIS TOMAHAWK FROM HIS GIRDLE AND FILLING THE BOWL ON ITS HEAD BEGAN TO INHALE THE VAPORS OF THE WEED THROUGH THE HOLLOW HANDLE
THE LOOKS OF MOST OF THE WARRIORS WERE RIVETED ON THE EARTH
LIKE MOST AROUND HIM FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE HIS LOOK TOO WAS ON THE GROUND BUT TRUSTING HIS EYES AT LENGTH TO STEAL A GLANCE ASIDE HE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS BECOMING AN OBJECT OF GENERAL ATTENTION
HE IS HAPPY WHO KNOWS THAT THE EVIL OF HIS RACE DIES WITH HIMSELF I HAVE DONE THE SPEAKER WHO WAS THE FATHER OF THE RECREANT YOUNG INDIAN LOOKED ROUND AND ABOUT HIM
SUFFERED HIM TO DEPART IN SILENCE THEN WITH AN ELEVATION OF BREEDING THAT MANY IN A MORE CULTIVATED STATE OF SOCIETY MIGHT PROFITABLY EMULATE ONE OF THE CHIEFS DREW THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG MEN
THOUGH THEY HAD SEEN FIT WITH THE MYSTERIOUS RESERVE SO COMMON AMONG THE NATIVES TO WITHHOLD THEIR ASSISTANCE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS MOST REQUIRED THE FRENCH HAD ACCOUNTED FOR THIS UNEXPECTED DEFECTION ON THE PART OF THEIR ALLY
IN VARIOUS WAYS IT WAS THE PREVALENT OPINION HOWEVER
FORTIFIED BY THESE ASSURANCES THE DARK FIGURE LEFT THE BROW OF THE NATURAL ROCKY TERRACE
SHE IS WELCOME RETURNED THE CHIEF OF THE LATTER NATION STILL MORE EMPHATICALLY THE BAFFLED MAGUA CONTINUED SILENT SEVERAL MINUTES APPARENTLY INDIFFERENT HOWEVER TO THE REPULSE HE HAD RECEIVED
WITH MANIFEST DISAPPROBATION IF NOT WITH ALARM
ESCAPED HIS VIGILANT EYES
THE DELAY HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE GRAVE PREPARATIONS THAT WERE DEEMED NECESSARY TO SO SOLEMN AND UNUSUAL A CONFERENCE BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS SEEN CLIMBING ABOVE THE TOPS OF THAT MOUNTAIN
HAD NUMBERED AN AMOUNT OF YEARS TO WHICH THE HUMAN RACE IS SELDOM PERMITTED TO ATTAIN HIS FRAME WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN TALL AND ERECT LIKE THE CEDAR WAS NOW BENDING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF MORE THAN A CENTURY
WHOSE DECISION WAS LIKELY TO PRODUCE SO DEEP AN INFLUENCE ON HIS OWN FORTUNES
THE AMERICANS SOMETIMES CALLED THEIR TUTELAR SAINT TAMENAY A CORRUPTION OF THE NAME OF THE RENOWNED CHIEF HERE INTRODUCED
WHO BELONGS RATHER TO ANOTHER WORLD THAN TO THIS WAS RECEIVED BY HIS PEOPLE AFTER A SUITABLE AND DECENT PAUSE
SO JUST AND SO VALIANT NONE BUT THE MOST DISTINGUISHED AMONG THE YOUTHFUL WARRIORS EVEN PRESUMED SO FAR AS TO PERFORM THE LATTER CEREMONY THE GREAT MASS OF THE MULTITUDE DEEMING IT A SUFFICIENT HAPPINESS
WITH LARGE BUSINESS SAGACITY AND AN EXECUTIVE CAPACITY WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN INHERITED FROM THEIR FATHER THEY NOW PROPOSED TO EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO A LARGER AREA AND DISTRIBUTE SOAP TO CONTIGUOUS VILLAGES
AND CASTING ASIDE WITHOUT THOUGHT OR PANG THE PLUSH CHAIR
AY SWEAT FOR THE HAPPY PRIVILEGE OF OCCUPYING THE SAME ROOM WITH THAT LAMP THROUGH THE COMING WINTER EVENINGS IT LOOKED TO BE ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL IN THE CATALOGUE AND EMMA JANE ADVISED CLARA BELLE TO MEASURE THE HEIGHT OF THE SIMPSON CEILINGS
BUT A NOTE IN THE MARGIN OF THE CIRCULAR INFORMED THEM THAT IT STOOD TWO AND A HALF FEET HIGH WHEN SET UP IN ALL ITS DIGNITY AND SPLENDOR ON A PROPER TABLE THREE DOLLARS EXTRA IT WAS ONLY OF POLISHED BRASS CONTINUED THE CIRCULAR
AND THE LATTER BEING INTENDED FOR THE TOILET THERE WAS A GREAT AMOUNT OF HILARITY IN THE PREPARATION FOR THIS EVENT AND A LONG COUNCIL IN EMMA JANE'S ATTIC THEY HAD THE SOAP COMPANY'S CIRCULAR FROM WHICH TO ARRANGE A PROPER SPEECH
SIX CAKES IN AN ORNAMENTAL BOX ONLY TWENTY CENTS FOR THE WHITE TWENTY FIVE CENTS FOR THE RED IT IS MADE FROM THE PUREST INGREDIENTS AND IF DESIRED COULD BE EATEN BY AN INVALID WITH RELISH AND PROFIT
I DON'T GET TO FEELING LIKE A FOOL SO AWFULLY EASY NOW LEAVE OUT THAT EATING PART IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT AND GO ON THE SNOW WHITE IS PROBABLY THE MOST REMARKABLE LAUNDRY SOAP EVER MANUFACTURED
THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AT EMMA JANE'S HOUSE WHERE REBECCA TO HER UNBOUNDED JOY WAS TO STAY OVER SUNDAY HER AUNTS HAVING GONE TO PORTLAND TO THE FUNERAL OF AN OLD FRIEND
SATURDAY BEING A HOLIDAY THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE THE OLD WHITE HORSE DRIVE TO NORTH RIVERBORO THREE MILES AWAY EAT A TWELVE O'CLOCK DINNER WITH EMMA JANE'S COUSINS AND BE BACK AT FOUR O'CLOCK PUNCTUALLY
SHE WAS AN INDULGENT PARENT HOWEVER AND REALLY HAD LITTLE OBJECTION TO EMMA JANE AMUSING HERSELF IN THIS UNUSUAL WAY IT WAS ONLY FOR REBECCA AS THE NIECE OF THE DIFFICULT MIRANDA SAWYER THAT SHE RAISED SCRUPLES
THEY DID NOT ACCOMPANY EACH OTHER TO THE DOORS OF THEIR CHOSEN VICTIMS FEELING SURE THAT TOGETHER THEY COULD NOT APPROACH THE SUBJECT SERIOUSLY BUT THEY PARTED AT THE GATE OF EACH HOUSE THE ONE HOLDING THE HORSE WHILE THE OTHER TOOK THE SOAP SAMPLES
AND INTERVIEWED ANY ONE WHO SEEMED OF A COMING ON DISPOSITION EMMA JANE HAD DISPOSED OF THREE SINGLE CAKES REBECCA OF THREE SMALL BOXES FOR A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO PERSUADE THE PUBLIC WAS CLEARLY DEFINED AT THE START
THOUGH NEITHER OF THEM ASCRIBED EITHER SUCCESS OR DEFEAT TO ANYTHING BUT THE IMPERIOUS FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES HOUSEWIVES LOOKED AT EMMA JANE AND DESIRED NO SOAP LISTENED TO HER DESCRIPTION OF ITS MERITS AND STILL DESIRED NONE
THAT LUCKY REBECCA ACCOMPLISHED WITH ALMOST NO EFFORT RESULTS THAT POOR LITTLE EMMA JANE FAILED TO ATTAIN BY HARD AND CONSCIENTIOUS LABOR IT'S YOUR TURN REBECCA AND I'M GLAD TOO SAID EMMA JANE
AT ALL EVENTS HE HAD AN AIR OF THE CITY ABOUT HIM WELL SHAVEN FACE WELL TRIMMED MUSTACHE WELL FITTING CLOTHES REBECCA WAS A TRIFLE SHY AT THIS UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT EXPLAIN HER PRESENCE
DO YOU NEED ANY SOAP QUERIED REBECCA DO I LOOK AS IF I DID HE RESPONDED UNEXPECTEDLY REBECCA DIMPLED I DIDN'T MEAN THAT I HAVE SOME SOAP TO SELL
SO YOU CONSIDER YOUR CHILDHOOD A THING OF THE PAST DO YOU YOUNG LADY I CAN STILL REMEMBER IT ANSWERED REBECCA GRAVELY THOUGH IT SEEMS A LONG TIME AGO
ANY CHILD COULD SEE THAT HIS EYES WERE TIRED AND HIS MOUTH WAS SAD WHEN HE WAS NOT SPEAKING I'M DOING PRETTY WELL THANK YOU SAID THE MAN WITH A DELIGHTFUL SMILE
I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID REBECCA CONSCIENTIOUSLY BUT I'LL LOOK IN THE CIRCULAR IT'S SURE TO TELL AND SHE DREW THE DOCUMENT FROM HER POCKET WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE MAGNIFICENT PROFITS YOU GET FROM THIS BUSINESS
WE ARE NOT SELLING FOR OUR OWN BENEFIT SAID REBECCA CONFIDENTIALLY MY FRIEND WHO IS HOLDING THE HORSE AT THE GATE IS THE DAUGHTER OF A VERY RICH BLACKSMITH AND DOESN'T NEED ANY MONEY
WHAT IF YOUR AUNT SHOULDN'T LIKE THE KIND OF SOAP QUERIED REBECCA NERVOUSLY MY AUNT ALWAYS LIKES WHAT I LIKE HE RETURNED MINE DOESN'T EXCLAIMED REBECCA THEN THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR AUNT OR WITH ME LAUGHED REBECCA
WHAT IS YOUR NAME YOUNG LADY REBECCA ROWENA RANDALL SIR WHAT WITH AN AMUSED SMILE BOTH YOUR MOTHER WAS GENEROUS SHE COULDN'T BEAR TO GIVE UP EITHER OF THE NAMES SHE SAYS
IT WOULD BE RATHER A NICE SURPRISE TO HAVE THE LAMP ARRIVE AT THE SIMPSONS ON THANKSGIVING DAY WOULDN'T IT HE ASKED AS HE TUCKED THE OLD LAP ROBE COSILY OVER THEIR FEET
EVEN IF MOTHER DID MAKE YOU PUT ON FLANNEL UNDERNEATH YOU DO LOOK SO PRETTY IN PINK AND RED REBECCA AND SO HOMELY IN DRAB AND BROWN I KNOW IT SIGHED REBECCA I WISH I WAS LIKE YOU PRETTY IN ALL COLORS
AND REBECCA LOOKED LONGINGLY AT EMMA JANE'S FAT ROSY CHEEKS AT HER BLUE EYES WHICH SAID NOTHING AT HER NEAT NOSE WHICH HAD NO CHARACTER AT HER RED LIPS FROM BETWEEN WHICH NO WORD WORTH LISTENING TO HAD EVER ISSUED
ON THANKSGIVING THE LAMP ARRIVED IN A LARGE PACKING BOX AND WAS TAKEN OUT AND SET UP BY SEESAW SIMPSON WHO SUDDENLY BEGAN TO ADMIRE AND RESPECT THE BUSINESS ABILITY OF HIS SISTERS
I TELL YOU HARRIET BEECHER STOWE HERSELF COULDN'T A DONE IT BETTER JUSTICE I TOOK IT ALL IN RESPONDED MISTER COBB WHO WAS PLEASED THAT MOTHER AGREED WITH HIM ABOUT REBECCA I AIN'T SURE BUT SHE'S GOIN TO TURN OUT SOMETHIN REMARKABLE
YES I DON'T LIKE A COW IN A COMPOSITION SAID THE DIFFICULT MISS DEARBORN
FOR THE NEXT WEEK MINNIE SMELLIE'S MOTHER TOLD MIRANDA SAWYER THAT SHE'D BETTER LOOK AFTER REBECCA FOR SHE WAS GIVEN TO SWEARING AND PROFANE LANGUAGE THAT SHE HAD BEEN HEARD SAYING SOMETHING DREADFUL THAT VERY AFTERNOON SAYING IT BEFORE EMMA JANE AND LIVING PERKINS WHO ONLY LAUGHED
WE COULDN'T KEEP FROM LAUGHING AFTER WE CAME OUT OF THE TENT BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTING ON SUCH A SMALL PLATFORM THAT ELIZA HAD TO RUN ROUND AND ROUND
THEY WERE YOUR OWN REBECCA INTERPOSED AUNT JANE AND IF YOU CHOSE TO SAVE THEM TO GIVE AWAY IT IS ALL RIGHT WE OUGHT NEVER TO LET THIS DAY PASS WITHOUT GIVING OUR NEIGHBORS SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR INSTEAD OF TAKING ALL THE TIME TO THINK OF OUR OWN MERCIES
THAT HE DECLARED HE WAS GOING TO BRING HER A CHRISTMAS PRESENT CONTINUED MISS ELLEN WELL THERE'S NO ACCOUNTIN FOR TASTES EXCLAIMED MISS MIRANDA CLARA BELLE'S GOT CROSS EYES AND RED HAIR BUT I'D BE THE LAST ONE TO GRUDGE HER A CHRISTMAS PRESENT
MURMURED SUSAN SAGACIOUSLY AT THE APPOINTED HOUR REBECCA DRAGGED HERSELF RELUCTANTLY AWAY FROM THE ENCHANTING SCENE
JANE ACCOMPANIED REBECCA INTO THE KITCHEN ALTHOUGH THE FEEBLE GLIMMER WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE FROM THAT DISTANCE DID NOT SEEM TO HER A DAZZLING EXHIBITION SHE TRIED TO BE AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS POSSIBLE REBECCA WHO WAS IT
THE THIRD MAN FROM THE END OH PATTY DID YOU BRING US SOME WEDDING CAKE DID YOU HAVE ANY ADVENTURES
IS IT LOCKED YES PATTY NODDED BUT MY KEY WILL OPEN IT
AND THINGS WHERE'D YOU GET IT WELL SAID PATTY LANGUIDLY IT'S A LONG STORY
MAM'SELLE WAS OUTRAGED SHE SAID IN FRENCH WHICH OF COURSE THEY ALL UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE THOUGHT AMERICAN COLLEGE BOYS HAD DISGRACEFUL MANNERS BUT I SMILED A LITTLE I COULDN'T HELP IT THEY WERE SO FUNNY AND THEN TWO OF THE BOTTOM ONES OFFERED THEIR SEATS AND WE SAT DOWN
EXCEPT JERMYN HILLIARD JUNIOR AND HE FOLLOWED ME RIGHT INTO THE PARLOR CAR AND SAT DOWN IN THE CHAIR EXACTLY OPPOSITE PATTY THEY CRIED IN SHOCKED CHORUS YOU SURELY DIDN'T SPEAK TO HIM
CONNY NODDED FEELINGLY THAT'S THE WAY THEY ACTED AT THE SEASIDE LAST SUMMER I THINK GROWN PEOPLE HAVE HORRID MANNERS I DID FEEL SORT OF YOUNG PATTY ACKNOWLEDGED
I TOLD YOU TO PUT IT UP SAID PRISCILLA JUST WAIT SAID PATTY PORTENTOUSLY WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS TO DRESS FOR DINNER THE MAID MET ME IN THE HALL WITH HER EYES POPPING OUT OF HER HEAD BEG PARDON MISS PATTY SHE SAID BUT IS THAT YOUR SUIT CASE YES I SAID OF COURSE IT'S MY SUIT CASE
BEFORE PATTY RESUMED HER CHRONICLE AND UNCLE TOM MADE ME TELL ABOUT THE SUIT CASE AT THE DINNER TABLE EVERYBODY LAUGHED IT MADE A VERY EXCITING STORY I TOLD THEM ABOUT THE WHOLE SCHOOL GOING TO THE GLEE CLUB AND FALLING IN LOVE IN A BODY WITH THE THIRD MAN FROM THE END
EIGHT OTHERS FOLLOWED HER EXAMPLE AND THRILLED AT THE TOUCH IT WAS CALCULATED TO FIT A FAR LARGER PERSON THAN ANY PRESENT EVEN IRENE MC CULLOUGH FOUND IT BAGGY HE HAD AWFULLY BROAD SHOULDERS SAID ROSALIE STROKING THE SATIN LINING
SIGHED MAE MERTELLE WHY NOT BRISTLED PATTY YOU'RE SO
MISSUS TRENT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MISS PATTY WYATT COME TO THE DRAWING ROOM AND I AM TO TAKE THE SUIT CASE DOWN THE GENTLEMAN IS WAITING OH PATTY A GASP WENT AROUND THE ROOM DO YOUR HAIR UP QUICK PRISCILLA CAUGHT PATTY'S TWIN BRAIDS AND WOUND THEM AROUND HER HEAD
INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION THEY FELL TO WEEPING WHICH ONLY SERVED TO HEIGHTEN THE CURIOSITY OF THE PEASANTS AND TO MOVE THEIR COMPASSION GANEM'S MOTHER TOLD THEM WHAT SHE AND HER DAUGHTER HAD ENDURED AT WHICH THE GOOD COUNTRYWOMEN WERE SENSIBLY AFFLICTED
AND ENDEAVOURED TO COMFORT THEM THEY TREATED THEM AS WELL AS THEIR POVERTY WOULD PERMIT TOOK OFF THEIR HORSE HAIR SHIFTS WHICH WERE VERY UNEASY TO THEM AND PUT ON THEM OTHERS WHICH THEY GAVE THEM WITH SHOES AND SOMETHING TO COVER THEIR HEADS AND SAVE THEIR HAIR
AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO ALEPPO BUT WOULD NOT STAY THERE AND CONTINUING THEIR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE EUPHRATES CROSSED THE RIVER
AND RETURN TO FETNAH SHE WAS STILL CONFINED CLOSELY IN THE DARK TOWER SINCE THE DAY THAT HAD BEEN SO FATAL TO GANEM AND HERSELF HOWEVER DISAGREEABLE AS HER PRISON WAS TO HER IT WAS MUCH LESS GRIEVOUS THAN THE THOUGHTS OF GANEM'S MISFORTUNE
STOPS AND DRAWING NEAR THE DOOR TO LISTEN DISTINCTLY HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH FETNAH WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE ALWAYS ON GANEM UTTERED WITH A LOUD VOICE O GANEM TOO UNFORTUNATE GANEM WHERE ARE YOU AT THIS TIME
THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WHO OUGHT TO HAVE REWARDED PERSECUTES YOU AND IN REQUITAL FOR HAVING ALWAYS REGARDED ME AS A PERSON RESERVED FOR HIS BED YOU LOSE YOUR FORTUNE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
WILL NOT PREVENT YOUR BEING CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED FOR YOUR VIOLENT AND UNJUST PROCEEDINGS HERE FETNAH CEASED HER COMPLAINTS HER SIGHS AND TEARS PUTTING A STOP TO HER UTTERANCE
I THINK YOU CHARGE ME WITH VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WHO IS HE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE REGARD AND RESPELL HE HAD FOR ME IS IN A MISERABLE CONDITION SPEAK FREELY
I MUST OWN THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT HE SAW ME HE PERHAPS DESIGNED TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO ME AND CONCEIVED HOPES OF ENGAGING ME TO ADMIT HIS LOVE I GUESSED AT THIS BY THE EAGERNESS WHICH HE SHEWED IN ENTERTAINING ME
AND DOING ME ALL THE GOOD OFFICES I SO MUCH WANTED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS THEN IN BUT AS SOON AS HE HEARD THAT I HAD THE HONOUR TO BELONG TO YOU AH MADAM SAID HE THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE MASTER IS FORBIDDEN TO THE SLAVE FROM THAT MOMENT
AND ENLARGING ON THE OBLIGATIONS SHE OWED TO GANEM BUT ABOVE ALL SHE HIGHLY EXTOLLED HIS DISCRETION
I BELIEVE ALL YOU HAVE TOLD ME BUT WHY WAS IT SO LONG BEFORE YOU LET ME HEAR FROM YOU WAS THERE ANY NEED OF STAYING A WHOLE MONTH AFTER MY RETURN BEFORE YOU SENT ME WORD WHERE YOU WERE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS ANSWERED FETNAH
AND WILL BE PLEASED TO STEP TO MY HOUSE
FOR THEY WERE THE PERSONS THE SYNDIC HAD BEEN SPEAKING OF TO FETNAH THE SYNDIC'S WIFE BEING INFORMED BY THE SLAVE THAT A LADY FROM THE PALACE WAS IN HER HOUSE WAS HASTENING TO MEET HER BUT FETNAH WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE SLAVE DID NOT GIVE HER TIME
MADAM REPLIED ABOU AYOUB'S DISCONSOLATE WIDOW A FAVOURITE OF THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS A LADY WHOSE NAME IS FETNAH IS THE OCCASION OF ALL OUR MISFORTUNES THESE WORDS WERE LIKE A THUNDERBOLT TO THE FAVOURITE
THEREFORE LOOK ON ME AS YOUR DAUGHTER AND PERMIT ME TO VOW ETERNAL DUTY AND AFFECTION HAVING SO SAID SHE BOWED DOWN ON GANEM'S MOTHER WHO WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE COULD RETURN NO ANSWER
FETNAH HELD HER LONG IN HER ARMS AND ONLY LEFT HER TO EMBRACE THE DAUGHTER WHO SITTING UP
BUT WHY SHOULD WE DESPAIR OF SEEING HIM AGAIN WE SHALL FIND HIM THE HAPPINESS OF MEETING WITH YOU MAKES ME CONCEIVE FRESH HOPES PERHAPS THIS IS THE LAST DAY OF YOUR SUFFERINGS AND THE BEGINNING OF A GREATER FELICITY THAN YOU ENJOYED IN DAMASCUS
WHEN GANEM WAS WITH YOU FETNAH WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED BUT THE SYNDIC OF THE JEWELLERS COMING IN INTERRUPTED HER MADAM SAID HE TO HER I COME FROM SEEING A VERY MOVING OBJECT IT IS A YOUNG MAN WHOM A CAMEL DRIVER HAD JUST CARRIED TO AN HOSPITAL
THOUGH SHE FOUND SOMETHING OF GANEM IN THE OBJETS SHE BEHELD YET IN OTHER RESPECTS HE APPEARED SO DIFFERENT THAT SHE DURST NOT IMAGINE IT WAS HE THAT LAY BEFORE HER UNABLE HOWEVER TO WITHSTAND THE EARNEST DESIRE OF BEING SATISFIED
AND TOMORROW MORNING I WILL RETURN TO YOU THIS SAID SHE EMBRACED THE MOTHER AND THE DAUGHTER AND WENT AWAY AS SOON AS SHE CAME TO THE PALACE
HAVING THEREFORE NO LONGER CAUSE TO DOUBT BUT THAT HE HAD UNJUSTLY PERSECUTED GANEM AND HIS FAMILY AND HAD PUBLICLY WRONGED THEM HE RESOLVED TO MAKE THEM PUBLIC SATISFACTION
THAT YOUR SEARCH HAS PROVED SO SUCCESSFUL IT IS A REAL SATISFACTION TO ME NOT SO MUCH FOR YOUR SAKE AS FOR MY OWN I WILL KEEP THE PROMISE I HAVE MADE YOU YOU SHALL MARRY GANEM AND I HERE DECLARE YOU ARE NO LONGER MY SLAVE YOU ARE FREE
WHAT MIRACLE HAS RESTORED YOU TO MY SIGHT
NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN ANSWERED THE LADY
THE SYNDIC HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE WERE SO MOVED AT THE SPECTACLE THAT THEY COULD NOT FORBEAR WEEPING NOR SUFFICIENTLY ADMIRE THE SECRET WORKINGS OF PROVIDENCE WHICH HAD BROUGHT TOGETHER INTO THEIR HOUSE FOUR PERSONS WHOM FORTUNE HAD SO CRUELLY PERSECUTED
WHEN THEY HAD DRIED UP THEIR TEARS GANEM DREW THEM AFRESH BY THE RECITAL OF WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED FROM THE DAY HE LEFT FETNAH TILL THE MOMENT THE SYNDIC BROUGHT HIM TO HIS HOUSE HE TOLD THEM THAT HAVING TAKEN REFUGE IN A SMALL VILLAGE HE THERE FELL SICK
THE SYNDIC WHO WAS A MAN OF A GOOD TASTE CHOSE SUCH AS WERE VERY HANDSOME AND HAD THEM MADE UP WITH ALL EXPEDITION THEY WERE FINISHED IN THREE DAYS AND GANEM FINDING HIMSELF STRONG ENOUGH PREPARED TO GO ABROAD
GANEM RETURNED NO OTHER ANSWER TO THE VIZIER'S COMPLIMENT THAN BY PROFOUNDLY BOWING HIS HEAD
I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU AND DESIRE TO HEAR FROM YOUR OWN MOUTH WHERE YOU FOUND MY FAVOURITE AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR HER GANEM OBEYED
BUT HE WAS RESOLVED TO MARRY HER HAROON THOUGHT THIS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY THAT HE ORDERED HIS HISTORIOGRAPHER TO COMMIT IT TO WRITING WITH ALL ITS CIRCUMSTANCES
FOR GOODNESS SAKE PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU DON'T KNOW WHOSE VOICE THAT IS SHE CRIED THAT'S ROSEBREAST HE AND MISSUS ROSEBREAST HAVE BEEN HERE FOR QUITE A LITTLE WHILE
ONE SONG WAS A LITTLE LOUDER AND CLEARER THAN THE OTHERS BECAUSE IT CAME FROM A TREE VERY CLOSE AT HAND THE VERY TREE FROM WHICH THOSE SQUEAKY NOTES HAD COME JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE PETER SUSPECTED THAT THAT MUST BE THE SONG JENNY WREN MEANT HE LOOKED PUZZLED
OVER EACH EYE WAS A WHITISH LINE ALTOGETHER SHE LOOKED MORE AS IF SHE MIGHT BE A BIG MEMBER OF THE SPARROW FAMILY THAN THE WIFE OF HANDSOME ROSEBREAST
YOU ASK FARMER BROWN'S BOY WHO HELPS HIM MOST IN HIS POTATO PATCH AND HE'LL TELL YOU IT'S THE GROSBEAKS THEY CERTAINLY DO LOVE POTATO BUGS THEY EAT SOME FRUIT BUT ON THE WHOLE THEY ARE ABOUT AS USEFUL AROUND A GARDEN AS ANY ONE I KNOW
NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SEEN REDCOAT SO CLOSE AT HAND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY IT CAME OVER PETER THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH REDCOAT AND HE HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THE TROUBLE MIGHT BE REDCOAT HEARD THE RUSTLE OF PETER'S FEET AMONG THE DRY LEAVES
THE WING WAS BLEEDING A LITTLE OH DEAR WHATEVER SHALL I DO PETER RABBIT
FARMER BROWN'S BOY TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND CAREFULLY CUT OFF THE TWIG ON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE WING THEN DOING HIS BEST TO BE CAREFUL AND TO HURT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE HE WORKED THE OTHER PART OF THE TWIG OUT FROM THE UNDER SIDE
THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED FOR MAKING THE CIRCUIT OF THIS COUPLE AND CONSIDERING IT UNDER ALL ITS ASPECTS THENARDIER HAD JUST PASSED HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY MADAME THENARDIER WAS APPROACHING HER FORTIES WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO FIFTY IN A WOMAN
WHEN ONE SAW HER HANDLE COSETTE ONE SAID THAT IS THE HANGMAN ONE OF HER TEETH PROJECTED WHEN HER FACE WAS IN REPOSE THENARDIER WAS A SMALL THIN PALE ANGULAR BONY FEEBLE MAN
HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD A SYSTEM IN ADDITION HE WAS A GREAT SWINDLER
WE BELIEVE THAT HE HAD SIMPLY STUDIED IN HOLLAND FOR AN INN KEEPER THIS RASCAL OF COMPOSITE ORDER WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY SOME FLEMING FROM LILLE IN FLANDERS A FRENCHMAN IN PARIS A BELGIAN AT BRUSSELS
BEATING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SELLING TO SOME STEALING FROM OTHERS AND TRAVELLING LIKE A FAMILY MAN WITH WIFE AND CHILDREN IN A RICKETY CART IN THE REAR OF TROOPS ON THE MARCH WITH AN INSTINCT FOR ALWAYS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO THE VICTORIOUS ARMY
AND AT SUCH TIMES SINCE HE WAS ENRAGED WITH THE HUMAN RACE IN GENERAL AS HE BORE WITHIN HIM A DEEP FURNACE OF HATRED AND SINCE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUALLY AVENGING THEIR WRONGS
WHO ACCUSE EVERYTHING THAT PASSES BEFORE THEM OF EVERYTHING WHICH HAS BEFALLEN THEM AND WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO CAST UPON THE FIRST PERSON WHO COMES TO HAND AS A LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCE THE SUM TOTAL OF THE DECEPTIONS THE BANKRUPTCIES AND THE CALAMITIES OF THEIR LIVES
WHEN ALL THIS LEAVEN WAS STIRRED UP IN HIM AND BOILED FORTH FROM HIS MOUTH AND EYES HE WAS TERRIBLE WOE TO THE PERSON WHO CAME UNDER HIS WRATH AT SUCH A TIME IN ADDITION TO HIS OTHER QUALITIES THENARDIER WAS ATTENTIVE AND PENETRATING
EVERY NEW COMER WHO ENTERED THE TAVERN SAID ON CATCHING SIGHT OF MADAME THENARDIER THERE IS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE A MISTAKE SHE WAS NOT EVEN THE MISTRESS THE HUSBAND WAS BOTH MASTER AND MISTRESS
WITH THE MOST PROFUNDITY AND IN THE MOST MODERN FASHION THAT THING WHICH IS A VIRTUE AMONG BARBAROUS PEOPLES AND AN OBJECT OF MERCHANDISE AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES HOSPITALITY BESIDES HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE POACHER
TO SHAVE THE MAN TO PLUCK THE WOMAN TO PICK THE CHILD CLEAN TO QUOTE THE WINDOW OPEN THE WINDOW SHUT THE CHIMNEY CORNER THE ARM CHAIR THE CHAIR THE OTTOMAN THE STOOL THE FEATHER BED THE MATTRESS AND THE TRUSS OF STRAW
TO KNOW HOW MUCH THE SHADOW USES UP THE MIRROR AND TO PUT A PRICE ON IT AND BY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEVILS TO MAKE THE TRAVELLER PAY FOR EVERYTHING
SHE CEASED AND WAS ABOUT TO PASS ON IN HER DISCOURSE TO THE EXPOSITION OF OTHER MATTERS WHEN I BREAK IN AND SAY EXCELLENT IS THINE EXHORTATION AND SUCH AS WELL BESEEMETH THY HIGH AUTHORITY
AT ALL AND IF SO WHAT IT IS THEN SHE MADE ANSWER I AM ANXIOUS TO FULFIL MY PROMISE COMPLETELY AND OPEN TO THEE A WAY OF RETURN TO THY NATIVE LAND
FOR INSTANCE IF A MAN IS DIGGING THE EARTH FOR TILLAGE AND FINDS A MASS OF BURIED GOLD NOW SUCH A FIND IS REGARDED AS ACCIDENTAL YET IT IS NOT
NOT FROM ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE DISCOVERER SINCE NEITHER HE WHO BURIED THE GOLD NOR HE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD INTENDED THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE FOUND BUT AS I SAID IT HAPPENED
AND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISING
INDEED AT TIMES THE HIGHER AND SUBLIMER THING TAKES PLACE WE LEARN TO DESPISE WHEN WE LOVE AND PRECISELY WHEN WE LOVE BEST ALL OF IT HOWEVER UNCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT NOISE
IS OPPOSED TO OUR TASTE NOWADAYS THIS IS ALSO AN ADVANCE AS IT WAS AN ADVANCE IN OUR FATHERS THAT RELIGION AS AN ATTITUDE FINALLY BECAME OPPOSED TO THEIR TASTE INCLUDING THE ENMITY
LET US BE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BEING CREDITED WITH MORAL TACT AND SUBTLETY IN MORAL DISCERNMENT THEY NEVER FORGIVE US IF THEY HAVE ONCE MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE US
I SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES
IS PRECISELY THE SPIRITUALISING OF JUSTICE
THE FACT THEREBY BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT THE GREATER PART OF WHAT INTERESTS AND CHARMS HIGHER NATURES AND MORE REFINED AND FASTIDIOUS TASTES SEEMS ABSOLUTELY UNINTERESTING TO THE AVERAGE MAN IF
THAT HE WANTED AND OBTAINED SOMETHING FOR IT PERHAPS SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF THAT HE RELINQUISHED HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE PERHAPS IN GENERAL TO BE MORE
AND WHO THE OTHER IS FOR INSTANCE IN A PERSON CREATED AND DESTINED FOR COMMAND SELF DENIAL AND MODEST RETIREMENT INSTEAD OF BEING VIRTUES WOULD BE THE WASTE OF VIRTUES
THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME
FELLOW SUFFERING IS PREACHED NOWADAYS AND IF I GATHER RIGHTLY NO OTHER RELIGION IS ANY LONGER PREACHED LET THE PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE HIS EARS OPEN THROUGH ALL THE VANITY THROUGH ALL THE NOISE WHICH IS NATURAL TO THESE PREACHERS
THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF WHICH ARE ALREADY SPECIFIED DOCUMENTARILY IN A THOUGHTFUL LETTER OF GALIANI TO MADAME D'EPINAY IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF THE MAN OF MODERN IDEAS
AND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ITS MOMENTS OF DESPERATION ON ACCOUNT OF NOTHING SUITING US IT IS IN VAIN TO GET OURSELVES UP AS ROMANTIC OR CLASSICAL OR CHRISTIAN
THE HISTORICAL SENSE OR THE CAPACITY FOR DIVINING QUICKLY THE ORDER OF RANK OF THE VALUATIONS ACCORDING TO WHICH A PEOPLE A COMMUNITY OR AN INDIVIDUAL HAS LIVED
HAS COME TO US IN THE TRAIN OF THE ENCHANTING AND MAD SEMI BARBARITY INTO WHICH EUROPE HAS BEEN PLUNGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC MINGLING OF CLASSES AND RACES IT IS ONLY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT HAS RECOGNIZED THIS FACULTY
AS ITS SIXTH SENSE OWING TO THIS MINGLING THE PAST OF EVERY FORM AND MODE OF LIFE AND OF CULTURES WHICH WERE FORMERLY CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS AND SUPERIMPOSED ON ONE ANOTHER FLOWS FORTH INTO US
AT LEAST TO THE VERY BAD TASTE AND WE CAN ONLY EVOKE IN OURSELVES IMPERFECTLY HESITATINGLY AND WITH COMPULSION THE SMALL SHORT AND HAPPY GODSENDS AND GLORIFICATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
APPLIES TO THAT WHICH HAS TO BE FASHIONED BRUISED FORGED STRETCHED ROASTED ANNEALED REFINED
PRECISELY HERE WE ARE MEN OF DUTY EVEN WE OCCASIONALLY IT IS TRUE WE DANCE IN OUR CHAINS AND BETWIXT OUR SWORDS
IT IS DESIRABLE THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD REFLECT UPON MORALS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT MORALS SHOULD NOT SOME DAY BECOME INTERESTING
HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
PONSONBY SOUND BUILD WIGWAMS AND SETTLE THE FUEGIANS BIFURCATION OF THE BEAGLE CHANNEL GLACIERS RETURN TO THE SHIP SECOND VISIT IN THE SHIP TO THE SETTLEMENT EQUALITY OF CONDITION AMONGST THE NATIVES
AND WE AS WELL AS OTHERS MAY CALL THIS GOOD SUCCESS BAY IN THE MORNING THE CAPTAIN SENT A PARTY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE FUEGIANS WHEN WE CAME WITHIN HAIL
AND THEY SEEM CLOSELY ALLIED TO THE FAMOUS PATAGONIANS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN THEIR ONLY GARMENT CONSISTS OF A MANTLE MADE OF GUANACO SKIN WITH THE WOOL OUTSIDE THIS THEY WEAR JUST THROWN OVER THEIR SHOULDERS LEAVING THEIR PERSONS AS OFTEN EXPOSED AS COVERED
AND THE EXPRESSION OF THEIR COUNTENANCES DISTRUSTFUL SURPRISED AND STARTLED AFTER WE HAD PRESENTED THEM WITH SOME SCARLET CLOTH WHICH THEY IMMEDIATELY TIED ROUND THEIR NECKS THEY BECAME GOOD FRIENDS THIS WAS SHOWN BY THE OLD MAN PATTING OUR BREASTS
WHICH OF US FOR INSTANCE COULD FOLLOW AN AMERICAN INDIAN THROUGH A SENTENCE OF MORE THAN THREE WORDS ALL SAVAGES APPEAR TO POSSESS TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE THIS POWER OF MIMICRY I WAS TOLD ALMOST IN THE SAME WORDS OF THE SAME LUDICROUS HABIT AMONG THE CAFFRES
AND WHEN EXCITED VIOLENTLY PASSIONATE HIS AFFECTIONS WERE VERY STRONG TOWARDS A FEW FRIENDS ON BOARD HIS INTELLECT GOOD JEMMY BUTTON WAS A UNIVERSAL FAVOURITE BUT LIKEWISE PASSIONATE THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE AT ONCE SHOWED HIS NICE DISPOSITION
OF A MAN BEING SEA SICK WAS TOO LUDICROUS AND HE WAS GENERALLY OBLIGED TO TURN ON ONE SIDE TO HIDE A SMILE OR LAUGH
POOR POOR FELLOW HE WAS OF A PATRIOTIC DISPOSITION AND HE LIKED TO PRAISE HIS OWN TRIBE AND COUNTRY
ALTHOUGH ALL THREE COULD BOTH SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND A GOOD DEAL OF ENGLISH IT WAS SINGULARLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN MUCH INFORMATION FROM THEM CONCERNING THE HABITS OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN THIS WAS PARTLY OWING TO THEIR APPARENT DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THE SIMPLEST ALTERNATIVE
WE THOUGHT THAT THEY MISTOOK TWO OR THREE OF THE OFFICERS WHO WERE RATHER SHORTER AND FAIRER THOUGH ADORNED WITH LARGE BEARDS FOR THE LADIES OF OUR PARTY
THE MOUNTAIN SIDES EXCEPT ON THE EXPOSED WESTERN COAST ARE COVERED FROM THE WATER'S EDGE UPWARDS BY ONE GREAT FOREST
HAD CLEARED A STRAIGHT SPACE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE BY THIS ROAD I ASCENDED TO A CONSIDERABLE ELEVATION AND OBTAINED A GOOD VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING WOODS THE TREES ALL BELONG TO ONE KIND THE FAGUS BETULOIDES
A RIDGE CONNECTED THIS HILL WITH ANOTHER DISTANT SOME MILES AND MORE LOFTY SO THAT PATCHES OF SNOW WERE LYING ON IT AS THE DAY WAS NOT FAR ADVANCED I DETERMINED TO WALK THERE AND COLLECT PLANTS ALONG THE ROAD
WHERE GALE SUCCEEDS GALE WITH RAIN HAIL AND SLEET SEEMS BLACKER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN LOOKING DUE SOUTHWARD FROM PORT FAMINE THE DISTANT CHANNELS BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS APPEARED FROM THEIR GLOOMINESS TO LEAD BEYOND THE CONFINES OF THIS WORLD
AND WE ENJOYED A FINE VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING ISLES CAPE HORN HOWEVER DEMANDED HIS TRIBUTE AND BEFORE NIGHT SENT US A GALE OF WIND DIRECTLY IN OUR TEETH WE STOOD OUT TO SEA AND ON THE SECOND DAY AGAIN MADE THE LAND
THE FUEGIAN WIGWAM RESEMBLES IN SIZE AND DIMENSIONS A HAYCOCK IT MERELY CONSISTS OF A FEW BROKEN BRANCHES STUCK IN THE GROUND AND VERY IMPERFECTLY THATCHED ON ONE SIDE WITH A FEW TUFTS OF GRASS AND RUSHES THE WHOLE CANNOT BE THE WORK OF AN HOUR
ON THE WEST COAST HOWEVER THE WIGWAMS ARE RATHER BETTER FOR THEY ARE COVERED WITH SEAL SKINS WE WERE DETAINED HERE SEVERAL DAYS BY THE BAD WEATHER THE CLIMATE IS CERTAINLY WRETCHED THE SUMMER SOLSTICE WAS NOW PASSED
YET EVERY DAY SNOW FELL ON THE HILLS AND IN THE VALLEYS THERE WAS RAIN ACCOMPANIED BY SLEET THE THERMOMETER GENERALLY STOOD
WHENEVER IT IS LOW WATER WINTER OR SUMMER NIGHT OR DAY THEY MUST RISE TO PICK SHELL FISH FROM THE ROCKS AND THE WOMEN EITHER DIVE TO COLLECT SEA EGGS OR SIT PATIENTLY IN THEIR CANOES AND WITH A BAITED HAIR LINE WITHOUT ANY HOOK JERK OUT LITTLE FISH
WHO DURING THIS TIME PRESERVED A PROFOUND SILENCE MISTER LOW BELIEVES THAT WHENEVER A WHALE IS CAST ON SHORE THE NATIVES BURY LARGE PIECES OF IT IN THE SAND AS A RESOURCE IN TIME OF FAMINE AND A NATIVE BOY WHOM HE HAD ON BOARD ONCE FOUND A STOCK THUS BURIED
THE DIFFERENT TRIBES WHEN AT WAR ARE CANNIBALS FROM THE CONCURRENT BUT QUITE INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE OF THE BOY TAKEN BY MISTER LOW AND OF JEMMY BUTTON IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT WHEN PRESSED IN WINTER BY HUNGER
THOUGH PERHAPS THE MUTTERING OF THE OLD MAN BEFORE HE DISTRIBUTED THE PUTRID BLUBBER TO HIS FAMISHED PARTY MAY BE OF THIS NATURE EACH FAMILY OR TRIBE HAS A WIZARD OR CONJURING DOCTOR WHOSE OFFICE WE COULD NEVER CLEARLY ASCERTAIN JEMMY BELIEVED IN DREAMS
THOUGH NOT AS I HAVE SAID IN THE DEVIL I DO NOT THINK THAT OUR FUEGIANS WERE MUCH MORE SUPERSTITIOUS THAN SOME OF THE SAILORS FOR AN OLD QUARTERMASTER FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THE SUCCESSIVE HEAVY GALES WHICH WE ENCOUNTERED OFF CAPE HORN WERE CAUSED BY OUR HAVING THE FUEGIANS ON BOARD
HAS ALWAYS APPEARED TO ME MOST MYSTERIOUS FROM WHAT YORK SAID WHEN WE FOUND THE PLACE LIKE THE FORM OF A HARE WHERE A SINGLE MAN HAD SLEPT THE NIGHT BEFORE
THEY CANNOT KNOW THE FEELING OF HAVING A HOME AND STILL LESS THAT OF DOMESTIC AFFECTION FOR THE HUSBAND IS TO THE WIFE A BRUTAL MASTER TO A LABORIOUS SLAVE WAS A MORE HORRID DEED EVER PERPETRATED THAN THAT WITNESSED ON THE WEST COAST BY BYRON
FOR REASON TO COMPARE OR JUDGMENT TO DECIDE UPON TO KNOCK A LIMPET FROM THE ROCK DOES NOT REQUIRE EVEN CUNNING THAT LOWEST POWER OF THE MIND THEIR SKILL IN SOME RESPECTS MAY BE COMPARED TO THE INSTINCT OF ANIMALS FOR IT IS NOT IMPROVED BY EXPERIENCE
OR WHAT CHANGE COMPELLED A TRIBE OF MEN TO LEAVE THE FINE REGIONS OF THE NORTH TO TRAVEL DOWN THE CORDILLERA OR BACKBONE OF AMERICA TO INVENT AND BUILD CANOES WHICH ARE NOT USED BY THE TRIBES OF CHILE PERU AND BRAZIL
AND THEN TO ENTER ON ONE OF THE MOST INHOSPITABLE COUNTRIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE GLOBE ALTHOUGH SUCH REFLECTIONS MUST AT FIRST SEIZE ON THE MIND YET WE MAY FEEL SURE THAT THEY ARE PARTLY ERRONEOUS THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE FUEGIANS DECREASE IN NUMBER
I CAN SEE NOW THAT TO CHILDREN WITH A PROPER EQUIPMENT OF PARENTS THESE THINGS WOULD HAVE WORN A DIFFERENT ASPECT BUT TO THOSE WHOSE NEAREST WERE AUNTS AND UNCLES A SPECIAL ATTITUDE OF MIND MAY BE ALLOWED THEY TREATED US INDEED WITH KINDNESS ENOUGH AS TO THE NEEDS OF THE FLESH
THOUGH THE WHOLE PLACE SWARMED WITH SUCH PORTENTS THEY CARED NOT ABOUT EXPLORING FOR ROBBERS CAVES NOR DIGGING FOR HIDDEN TREASURE PERHAPS INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THEIR BEST QUALITIES THAT THEY SPENT THE GREATER PART OF THEIR TIME STUFFILY INDOORS
THEN TOO HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO CONSTITUTE HIMSELF A HOSTILE ARMY OR A BAND OF MARAUDING INDIANS ON THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE NOTICE IN BRIEF A DISTINCTLY ABLE MAN WITH TALENTS SO FAR AS WE COULD JUDGE IMMENSELY ABOVE THE MAJORITY
UNDER THE DELUSION THAT THESE PALE PHANTASMS OF REALITY WERE AMONG THE IMPORTANCES OF LIFE WE ILLUMINATI EATING SILENTLY OUR HEADS FULL OF PLANS AND CONSPIRACIES COULD HAVE TOLD THEM WHAT REAL LIFE WAS
WE HAD JUST LEFT IT OUTSIDE AND WERE ALL ON FIRE TO GET BACK TO IT OF COURSE WE DIDN'T WASTE THE REVELATION ON THEM THE FUTILITY OF IMPARTING OUR IDEAS HAD LONG BEEN DEMONSTRATED ONE IN THOUGHT AND PURPOSE LINKED BY THE NECESSITY OF COMBATING ONE HOSTILE FATE
THAN THE KINDLY BEASTS WHO SHARED OUR NATURAL EXISTENCE IN THE SUN THE ESTRANGEMENT WAS FORTIFIED BY AN ABIDING SENSE OF INJUSTICE
BUT WAS THE MATTER ALLOWED TO END THERE I TROW NOT AGAIN WHEN HAROLD WAS LOCKED UP IN HIS ROOM ALL DAY FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY UPON A NEIGHBOUR'S PIG AN ACTION HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED BEING INDEED ON THE FRIENDLIEST TERMS WITH THE PORKER IN QUESTION
SOME ONE OF US HAD HAD PRESENTS AND PRETTY CONVENTIONAL SPEECHES AND HAD GLOWED WITH THAT SENSE OF HEROISM WHICH IS NO LESS SWEET THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO DESERVE IT BUT THE HOLIDAY WAS FOR ALL THE RAPTURE OF AWAKENING NATURE FOR ALL
FLASHED THE COLOUR BACK TRUE AND BRILLIANT AND THE SOFT AIR THRILLED WITH THE GERMINATING TOUCH THAT SEEMED TO KINDLE SOMETHING IN MY OWN SMALL PERSON AS WELL AS IN THE RASH PRIMROSE ALREADY LURKING IN SHELTERED HAUNTS OUT INTO THE BRIMMING SUN BATHED WORLD I SPED FREE OF LESSONS
DO SHOUTED EDWARD VALIANTLY I SHOULD I SHOULD I SHOULD
NO I WON'T I SWEAR I WON'T PROTESTED EDWARD I'LL BE QUITE A NEW LION THIS TIME SOMETHING YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE AND HE RACED OFF TO HIS POST CHARLOTTE HESITATED THEN SHE WENT TIMIDLY ON
AND PRESENTLY I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE VILLAGE CHURCH SITTING SOLITARY WITHIN ITS CIRCLE OF ELMS FROM FORTH THE VESTRY WINDOW PROJECTED TWO SMALL LEGS GYRATING HUNGRY FOR FOOTHOLD WITH LARCENY
I SEEMED TO DISCERN FAINTLY A SOMETHING OF THE STERN MEANING IN HER VALOROUS CHANT MY INVISIBLE COMPANION WAS SINGING ALSO AND SEEMED AT TIMES TO BE CHUCKLING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF DOUBTLESS AT THOUGHT OF THE STRANGE NEW LESSONS HE WAS TEACHING ME
STOOD THE ANCIENT WHIPPING POST OF THE VILLAGE ITS SIDES FRETTED WITH THE INITIALS OF A GENERATION THAT SCORNED ITS MUTE LESSON BUT STILL CLIPPED BY THE STOUT RUSTY SHACKLES THAT HAD TETHERED THE WRISTS
KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT THREE MAKE ONE KNIT ONE MAKE ONE KNIT THREE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT ONE MAKE ONE SECOND ROW
MAKE ONE KNIT ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER
THERE WAS HOPE THAT OTHERS MIGHT ALSO ESCAPE THOUGH THE GALE HAD SENT TWO TO THE BOTTOM A SWIFT SAILING STEAMER HAD BROUGHT THESE SCANTY NEWS AND HAPPIER ONES MIGHT COME AT ANY HOUR BUT KIND FRANZ HAD NOT ADDED THAT THE SAILORS REPORTED THE CAPTAIN'S BOAT AS UNDOUBTEDLY WRECKED BY THE FALLING MAST
NOTHING COULD COMFORT HER NAN DOSED IN VAIN DAISY'S CHEERFUL WORDS WENT BY LIKE THE WIND AND BESS'S DEVICES TO AMUSE HER ALL FAILED UTTERLY TO CRY IN MOTHER'S ARMS AND TALK ABOUT THE WRECK WHICH HAUNTED HER EVEN IN HER SLEEP WAS ALL SHE CARED TO DO
AND LET HER ROMANCES WAIT NOW MESSAGES OF CONGRATULATION FLOWED IN AND BEAMING FACES SHOWED EVERYWHERE ROB AMAZED HIS PARENTS BY PRODUCING A POEM WHICH WAS REMARKABLY GOOD FOR ONE OF HIS YEARS AND DEMI SET IT TO MUSIC THAT IT MIGHT BE SUNG WHEN THE SAILOR BOY RETURNED
WITH THE SHADOW OF PAST SORROW TO TONE DOWN HER FORMER VIVACITY AND SHOW THAT SHE HAD LEARNED A LESSON IN TRYING TO ACT WELL HER PART ON THE REAL STAGE WHERE ALL HAVE TO TAKE THEIR SHARE IN THE GREAT DRAMA OF LIFE
WHILE THEY WAIT AND WORK SO HAPPILY LET US SEE HOW OUR OTHER ABSENT BOYS ARE FARING AS THEY TOO WAIT AND WORK AND HOPE FOR BETTER DAYS NAT WAS TOILING STEADILY ALONG THE PATH HE HAD WISELY CHOSEN THOUGH IT WAS BY NO MEANS STREWN WITH FLOWERS
THAT HE WAS CHOSEN WITH SEVERAL OTHER OF HIS MOST PROMISING PUPILS TO JOIN THE MUSICAL SOCIETY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PART IN THE GREAT FESTIVAL IN LONDON THE NEXT JULY HERE WAS NOT ONLY HONOUR FOR THE VIOLINIST BUT HAPPINESS FOR THE MAN AS IT BROUGHT HIM NEARER HOME
HE HAD FOUND THE LITTLE GUIDE BOOK THAT CHRISTIAN CARRIED IN HIS BOSOM AND LOVE PENITENCE AND PRAYER THE THREE SWEET SISTERS HAD GIVEN HIM THE ARMOUR WHICH WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE HE HAD NOT LEARNED TO WEAR IT YET AND CHAFED AGAINST IT THOUGH HE FELT ITS VALUE
WHEN HE THOUGHT OF IT DAN FELT AS IF HE COULD NOT WAIT BUT MUST BURST THAT NARROW CELL AND FLY AWAY AS THE CADDIS WORMS HE USED TO WATCH BY THE BROOKSIDE SHED THEIR STONY COFFINS TO CLIMB THE FERNS AND SOAR INTO THE SKY NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE LULLED HIMSELF TO SLEEP WITH PLANNING HOW
OF COURSE PETER COULDN'T BE LEFT OUT OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND HE SCAMPERED FOR THE SCENE OF TROUBLE AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD TAKE HIM
SCRAPPER'S SLIGHTLY RAISED CAP SEEMED ALL BLACK BUT IF PETER COULD HAVE GOTTEN CLOSE ENOUGH HE WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT HIDDEN IN IT WAS A PATCH OF ORANGE RED WHILE PETER SAT STARING UP AT HIM SCRAPPER SUDDENLY DARTED OUT INTO THE AIR
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY HONEY IF I DID
THERE'S A FLY WAY OVER THERE BEYOND THAT OLD APPLE TREE WATCH ME CATCH IT PETER KNEW BETTER THAN TO WASTE ANY EFFORT TRYING TO SEE THAT FLY HE KNEW THAT HE COULDN'T HAVE SEEN IT HAD IT BEEN ONLY ONE FOURTH THAT DISTANCE AWAY
BUT IF HE COULDN'T SEE THE FLY HE COULD HEAR THE SHARP CLICK OF SCRAPPER'S BILL AND HE KNEW BY THE WAY SCRAPPER KEPT OPENING AND SHUTTING HIS MOUTH AFTER HIS RETURN THAT HE HAD CAUGHT THAT FLY AND IT HAD TASTED GOOD
HE JUST COULDN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THOSE CAST OFF SUITS OF THE SNAKE FAMILY AND HE FELT SURE THAT JENNY WREN COULD TELL HIM FINALLY CURIOSITY GOT THE BEST OF HIM AND BACK HE SCAMPERED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP TO THE FOOT OF THE TREE IN WHICH JENNY WREN HAD HER HOME
JENNY CALLED PETER JENNY WREN JENNY WREN NO ONE ANSWERED HIM HE COULD HEAR MISTER WREN SINGING IN ANOTHER TREE BUT HE COULDN'T SEE HIM JENNY JENNY WREN JENNY WREN CALLED PETER AGAIN
GO TO FOR WHAT SNAPPED JENNY WREN WHAT IS IT YOU'VE COME TO ME FOR SNAKE SKINS REPLIED PETER SNAKE SKINS SNAKE SKINS SHRIEKED JENNY WREN
HE JUST HAD TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS ANYTHING NEW OVER THERE HARDLY HAD HE REACHED IT WHEN HE HEARD A PLAINTIVE VOICE CRYING PEE WEE PEE WEE PEE WEE PETER CHUCKLED HAPPILY
BUT NO ONE COULD EVER MISTAKE PEWEE FOR ANY OF HIS RELATIVES FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE KEEPS REPEATING HIS OWN NAME OVER AND OVER AREN'T YOU HERE EARLY ASKED PETER PEWEE NODDED
THEN AS PETER SHOOK HIS HEAD HER TONGUE RAN ON WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIM TO REPLY CRESTY AND HIS WIFE ALWAYS INSIST UPON HAVING A PIECE OF SNAKE SKIN IN THEIR NEST SAID SHE WHY THEY WANT IT GOODNESS KNOWS BUT
IN A HOLE IN A TREE LIKE THE REST OF US SENSIBLE PEOPLE RETORTED JENNY WREN PROMPTLY PETER LOOKED QUITE AS SURPRISED AS HE FELT DOES CRESTY MAKE THE HOLE HE ASKED GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO EXCLAIMED JENNY WREN
THE OLDER IT IS THE BETTER IT SUITS ME BUT THE WOODPECKERS SEEM TO LIKE NEW HOUSES BEST WHICH AS I SAID BEFORE IS A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US
HE HAD JUST A GLIMPSE OF A BROWN FORM DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF SOME TALL BUSHES THEN PETER CHUCKLED
HIS BACK WAS A MIXTURE OF GRAY BROWN BLACK AND BUFF WHILE HIS BREAST AND UNDER PARTS WERE A BEAUTIFUL REDDISH BUFF IT WAS HIS HEAD THAT MADE HIM LOOK QUEER
HIS EYES WERE VERY BIG AND THEY WERE SET SO FAR BACK THAT PETER WONDERED IF IT WASN'T EASIER FOR HIM TO LOOK BEHIND HIM THAN IN FRONT OF HIM SUDDENLY LONGBILL PLUNGED HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND HE PLUNGED IT IN FOR THE WHOLE LENGTH
I THINK THERE IS ONE RIGHT UNDER MY FEET NOW WATCH ME GET HIM LONGBILL BORED INTO THE GROUND UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS ALMOST AGAINST IT WHEN HE PULLED HIS BILL OUT SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A WORM OF COURSE EXPLAINED LONGBILL IT IS ONLY IN SOFT GROUND THAT I CAN DO THIS
IN THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE SURFACE IS BROKEN BY NUMEROUS BARRIERS SUCH AS MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS ALMOST EVERY VALLEY WAS FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY A DISTINCT GROUP OF INDIANS CALLED A TRIBE
WOULD BE THE MOST ADVANCED IN CIVILIZATION BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE MANY OF THEM WERE AMONG THE MOST DEGRADED UPON THE CONTINENT THEY SEEMED UNABLE TO ADAPT THEMSELVES TO THE WHITE MAN AND HIS WAYS
AT CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR WHEN SALMON WERE PLENTIFUL EACH TRIBE OR GROUP OF INDIANS ESTABLISHED ITS CAMP NEAR ONE OF THE MANY RAPIDS AND WATERFALLS ALONG THE COLUMBIA RIVER LARGE NUMBERS OF THE SALMON WERE CAUGHT BY THE USE OF TRAPS
AFTER BEING PARTLY DRIED THEY WERE PACKED IN BALES FOR WINTER USE THE FISH THUS PREPARED WERE CONSIDERED VERY VALUABLE AND FORMED AN ARTICLE OF TRADE WITH THE TRIBES LIVING FARTHER FROM THE RIVER
BUT THIS ENTHUSIASM QUICKLY DISAPPEARS IF A HEAD WIND COMES UP AND THE PARTY GOES ASHORE TO WAIT FOR THE BREEZE TO TURN IN A MORE FAVORABLE DIRECTION THESE INDIANS AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED LIVE LARGELY UPON FISH
FOR THESE INDIANS DO NOT MOVE ABOUT AS MUCH AS THOSE FARTHER SOUTH WHERE THE FORESTS ARE LESS DENSE FIGURE SIXTY FIVE SHOWS THE FRAMEWORK OF A PARTIALLY BUILT HOUSE WHILE ANOTHER STANDS AT ONE SIDE COMPLETED
AND THE BUILDING IS PRACTICALLY FINISHED SUCH A HOUSE IS USUALLY OCCUPIED BY A NUMBER OF FAMILIES UPON QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS THERE IS A DWELLING OF THIS KIND LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD SEVEN HUNDRED INDIANS
SOLOMON OWL MADE NO REPLY HE WAS A PERSON OF FEW WORDS IF ANYBODY ASKED HIS OPINION HE WAS READY TO GIVE IT BUT HE SELDOM GAVE ANY UNSOUGHT ADVICE
WHY DIDN'T YOU GRAB HIM OUT OF THE SNOW SIMON ASKED WHAT ARE YOUR CLAWS FOR WHAT'S YOUR BEAK FOR I COULDN'T DIG HIM OUT SOLOMON OWL REPLIED THE SNOW IS THREE FEET DEEP
EATING A TREE AS SIMON SCREECHER REMARKED TO HIS COUSIN SOLOMON OWL IT WAS A HARD WINTER THE SNOW WAS DEEP THE DAYS WERE COLD AND THE NIGHTS WERE COLDER AND WORST OF ALL FOOD BECAME SCARCE
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THAT MY COUSIN FORGOT TO EXPLAIN SO I SUPPOSE I'LL HAVE TO RUN AFTER HIM AGAIN AND ASK HIM WHAT HE MEANT THE FOURTH TIME THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE FOUND HIS COUSIN HE TOOK NO CHANCES
HIS COUSIN REPLIED STRUGGLING DESPERATELY TO FREE HIMSELF FOR HE WAS TOO BUSY TO STOP LONG THEN EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CRIED EAT THE BARK HIS COUSIN ANSWERED
I OUGHT TO HAVE PUT WIRE NETTING AROUND THOSE YOUNG TREES HE TOLD THE HIRED MAN THIS IS WHAT COMES OF A HARD WINTER
JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS SKATING FOR JOHNNIE GREEN ON TOP OF THE BROOK IT MUSTN'T BE SUPPOSED THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE A SWIM WHEN HE WANTED ONE
FOR THE MUSKRATS ALL HAD A WARNING SIGNAL THAT TOLD EVERYBODY WHEN THERE WAS DANGER WHEN ONE OF THEM CAUGHT SIGHT OF PETER MINK HE NEVER FAILED IF HE WAS IN THE WATER TO GIVE A LOUD SLAP UPON THE SURFACE WITH HIS TAIL
MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS HAD ONE EAR THAT WAS LISTENING FOR THAT SLAP AND WHEN IT SOUNDED HE NEVER WAITED AN INSTANT BUT DARTED INTO HIS TUNNEL WITHOUT EVEN STOPPING TO SHAKE THE WATER OFF HIS COAT
OH I WON'T BOTHER TO LOOK FOR PETER MINK TO DAY HE MUST BE MILES AWAY I'LL STEP RIGHT OUT OF MY TUNNEL AND HAVE MY SWIM WITHOUT TAKING A LOOK SEE FIRST BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS NEVER SO LAZY AS THAT
THAT PARADISE IS ATTAINED BY TOUCH FOR IN TOUCH IS ALL LOVE AND INTELLIGENCE THIS SMALL INCIDENT STARTED ME ON A CHAT ABOUT HANDS AND IF MY CHAT IS FORTUNATE I HAVE TO THANK MY DOG STAR
IN ALL MY EXPERIENCES AND THOUGHTS I AM CONSCIOUS OF A HAND WHATEVER MOVES ME WHATEVER THRILLS ME IS AS A HAND THAT TOUCHES ME IN THE DARK AND THAT TOUCH IS MY REALITY YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT A SIGHT WHICH MAKES YOU GLAD
OF BEAUTY OR OF INCONGRUITY FOR WITH MY HANDS I CAN FEEL THE COMIC AS WELL AS THE BEAUTIFUL IN THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF THINGS REMEMBER THAT YOU DEPENDENT ON YOUR SIGHT DO NOT REALIZE HOW MANY THINGS ARE TANGIBLE
THE PLEASING CHANGES OF ROUGH AND SMOOTH PLIANT AND RIGID CURVED AND STRAIGHT IN THE BARK AND BRANCHES OF A TREE GIVE THE TRUTH TO MY HAND THE IMMOVABLE ROCK WITH ITS JUTS AND WARPED SURFACE
THE SILENT WORKER IS IMAGINATION WHICH DECREES REALITY OUT OF CHAOS WITHOUT IMAGINATION WHAT A POOR THING MY WORLD WOULD BE
WHICH HE HAS EMBODIED IN A SCULPTURED FORM ALTHOUGH COMPARED WITH THE LIFE WARM MOBILE FACE OF A FRIEND THE MARBLE IS COLD AND PULSELESS AND UNRESPONSIVE YET IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO MY HAND
WHEN I TOUCH WHAT THERE IS OF THE WINGED VICTORY IT REMINDS ME AT FIRST OF A HEADLESS LIMBLESS DREAM THAT FLIES TOWARDS ME IN AN UNRESTFUL SLEEP
AND THEY LEARNED THEIR CUNNING FROM THE WISE HAND OF ANOTHER WHICH ITSELF GUIDED BY IMAGINATION LED ME SAFELY IN PATHS THAT I KNEW NOT
I S'POSE YOU'RE HERE ASKIN AFTER BARD
AN YOU SET OVER EM LIKE A HEN THEY LOOK LIKE EGGS THEY FEEL LIKE EGGS BUT THEY DON'T NEVER HATCH THAT'S THE WAY WITH YOUR IDEAS THEY LOOK ALL RIGHT THEY SOUND ALL RIGHT BUT THEY DON'T MEAN NOTHIN SO LONG
WHERE'S THE FOLKS HE ASKED MA'S SICK A LITTLE AND DIDN'T GET UP TO DAY PA'S DOWN TO THE CORRAL CUSSING MAD BUT I CAN COOK YOU UP SOME CHOW ALL RIGHT SON I GOT A DOLLAR HERE THAT'LL BUY YOU A PRETTY GOOD STORE KNIFE
RECOGNIZING THE TRUE WESTERN BREED EVEN IN THIS SMALL EDITION NASH GRINNED SPEAKIN MAN TO MAN SON I DIDN'T THINK THAT BUT I THOUGHT I'D SORT OF FEEL MY WAY WHICH I'LL SAY YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DIDN'T TRY TO FEEL YOUR WAY WITH PA
I WAS JUST THINKIN OF PA WHAT'S HE SORE ABOUT COME OUT SHORT AT POKER LATELY NO HE LOST A HOSS HA HA HA HE EXPLAINED
NASH SIPPED HIS COFFEE AND WAITED ON THE MOUNTAIN DESERT ONE DOES NOT DRAW OUT A NARRATOR WITH QUESTIONS
HE WAS A SURE ENOUGH TENDERFOOT LEASTWAYS HE LOOKED IT AN HE TALKED IT BUT HE WASN'T THE FAMILIARITY OF THIS DESCRIPTION MADE STEVE SIT UP A TRIFLE STRAIGHTER WAS HE A RINGER MAYBE I DUNNO
PA MEETS HIM AT THE DOOR AND ASKS HIM IN
THE BOY PAUSED TO REMEMBER AND THEN WITH TWINKLING EYES HE MIMICKED THAT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU SIR BUT I'LL ONLY STOP TO MAKE A TRADE WITH YOU THIS HORSE AND SOME CASH TO BOOT FOR A DURABLE MOUNT OUT OF YOUR CORRAL
WHEN HE SEEN THAT HE WAS ALL LAID OUT TO MAKE A TRIP BY HIMSELF
WELL THIS TENDERFOOT HE LOOKS OVER THE HOSS IN THE CORRAL AND SAYS
WHICH MAYBE YOU SORT OF GATHER THAT HE HAD TO KEEP ON PERFORMIN BECAUSE THE TENDERFOOT WAS STILL IN THE SADDLE HE WAS AN HE NEVER PULLED LEATHER NO SIR HE NEVER TOUCHED THE BUCKIN STRAP BUT JEST SAT THERE WITH HIS TEETH SET
AND HIS LIPS TWISTIN BACK THE SAME SMILE HE HAD WHEN HE GOT INTO THE SADDLE BUT PRETTY SOON I S'POSE JO HAD A CHANCE TO FIGURE OUT THAT IT DIDN'T DO HIM NO PARTICULAR HARM TO BE ALONE THE MINUTE HE SEEN THAT HE STOPPED FIGHTIN
BUT THE POINT IS I DIDN'T SEE IT D'YOU MIND IF I TURN IN ON THAT BUNK OVER THERE HELP YOURSELF SAID THE BOY WHAT TIME D'YOU WANT ME TO WAKE YOU UP NEVER MIND I WAKE UP AUTOMATIC S'LONG BUD
GHOST HOURS OF THE EARLY MORNING THEY DID NOT RELAX THEIR VIGIL
APPARENTLY THE PLACE WAS A HARMLESS ROOMING HOUSE OF FAIRLY GOOD QUALITY NOT A SIGN OF CAROLINE SMITH APPEARED EVEN DURING THE SECOND DAY
BY THIS TIME THE NERVES OF THE TWO WATCHERS WERE SHATTERED BY THE CONSTANT STRAIN AND THE MONOTONOUS VIEW FROM THE FRONT WINDOW WAS BEGINNING TO MADDEN THEM IT'S PROOF THAT SHE AIN'T YONDER SAID BILL GREGG
THERE STOOD CAROLINE SMITH IN THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE SHE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND WALKING TO THE TOP OF THE STEPS PAUSED THERE AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE STREET BILL GREGG GROANED
AND SO SWIFT WAS THAT DESCENT THAT WHEN THE GIRL IDLING DOWN THE STEPS ACROSS THE STREET CAME ONTO THE SIDEWALK BILL GREGG RUSHED OUT FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND RAN TOWARD HER
THE SAME DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEIR CLOTHES WAS IN THEIR FACES THE FINELY MODELED PRETTINESS OF HER FEATURES AND THE BIG CARELESS CHISELING OF THE FEATURES OF BILL GREGG RONICKY DOONE DID NOT WONDER THAT AFTER HER FIRST FEAR HER GESTURE WAS ONE OF DISDAIN AND SURPRISE
THE GIRL HESITATED A MOMENT
AS FOR BILL GREGG HE BORE HIMSELF STRAIGHT AS A SOLDIER AND CAME BACK ACROSS THE PAVEMENT BUT IT WAS THE ERECTNESS OF A SOLDIER WHO HAS MET WITH A CRUSHING DEFEAT AND ONLY PRESERVES AN OUTWARD RESOLUTION WHILE ALL THE SPIRIT WITHIN IS CRUSHED
LOOK AT THE WAY THINGS HAVE GONE YOU START OUT WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF A GIRL NOW YOU'VE FOLLOWED HER FOUND HER NAME
NOT YOU BILL YOU'RE GOING TO BUCK UP AND GO AHEAD FULL STEAM
D'YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID WELL BILL GREGG SHE SAYS I DON'T REMEMBER ANY SUCH NAME THAT TOOK THE WIND OUT OF ME I ONLY HAD ENOUGH LEFT TO SAY
SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE'D RUN AFTER YOU AND TRY TO EXPLAIN BUT THE FEAR OF THAT FELLOW UP IN THE WINDOW WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER AND SHE DIDN'T DARE BILL
CHAPTER TWELVE THE STRANGE BARGAIN RONICKY DREW HIS GUN AND WAITED GOOD SAID THE MAN OF THE SNEER GO AHEAD IT WAS DOWN IN THE CELLAR THAT WE FOUND THE FIRST TRACKS
THE TIME HAD ALMOST COME FOR ONE DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE AND HE WAS READY TO SHOOT TO KILL A MOMENT OF PAUSE HAD COME A PAUSE WHICH IN THE IMAGINATION OF RONICKY
YOU FOOL THEY SIMPLY GREW DIM WHEN THEY GOT TO THIS DOOR I'VE BEEN HERE FOR SOME TIME GO BACK AND TELL THEM TO HUNT SOME MORE GO UP TO THE ATTIC AND SEARCH THERE THAT'S THE PLACE AN AMATEUR WOULD MOST LIKELY HIDE
HAD THE CLEVER DEVIL GUESSED AT THE TRUTH SO EASILY HAD HE SENT HIS FOLLOWER AWAY MERELY TO AVOID HAVING IT KNOWN THAT A MAN HAD TAKEN SHELTER IN THE ROOM OF THE GIRL HE LOVED GO ON THE LEADER WAS REPEATING LET ME HEAR THE WHOLE TRUTH
THOUGH I WASN'T PLAYING MY HAND AT EAVESDROPPING I COULDN'T HELP HEARING YOU PARTNER THE MAN OF THE SNEER LOOKED HIM OVER LEISURELY WESTERN HE SAID AT LAST DECIDEDLY WESTERN ARE YOU STAYING LONG IN THE EAST MY FRIEND
RELIEF WONDER AND EVEN A GLEAM OF OUTRIGHT HAPPINESS SHOT INTO THE EYES OF JOHN MARK CAROLINE YOU CAME FOR THAT SUDDENLY HE LAUGHED HEARTILY BUT THERE WAS A TREMOR OF EMOTION IN THAT LAUGHTER
AND HE BRUSHED A HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD AND WAS INSTANTLY HIMSELF CALM AND COOL VERY WELL THEN IT SEEMS I'VE MADE AN ASS OF MYSELF BUT I'LL TRY TO MAKE UP FOR IT NOW WHAT ABOUT CAROLINE

SUPPOSE WE SHAKE HANDS TO BIND THE BARGAIN SAID RONICKY YOU SEND FOR CAROLINE SMITH I'M TO DO THE PERSUADING TO GET HER OUT OF THE HOUSE WE'RE SAFE TO THE DOORS OF THE HOUSE THE MINUTE WE STEP INTO THE STREET
SAID THEY THEN THE DRAGON SEIZED THEM IN HIS CLAWS TOOK THEM THROUGH THE AIR OVER THE ARMY AND SET THEM DOWN ON THE EARTH A LONG WAY FROM IT HE GAVE THEM A LITTLE WHIP SAYING
THEY WENT INTO A FIELD SAT DOWN AND THE TWO PULLED LONG FACES AN OLD WOMAN PASSED BY AND ASKED THEM WHY THEY WERE SO SAD
IF YOU WOULD HELP YOURSELVES ONE OF YOU MUST GO INTO THE WOOD AND THERE HE WILL COME UPON A TUMBLE DOWN BUILDING OF ROCKS WHICH LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE HOUSE HE MUST GO IN AND THERE HE WILL FIND HELP THE TWO MELANCHOLY ONES THOUGHT
THAT WON'T SAVE US AND THEY REMAINED WHERE THEY WERE BUT THE THIRD AND MERRY ONE JUMPED UP AND WENT INTO THE WOOD TILL HE FOUND THE ROCK HUT IN THE HUT SAT A VERY OLD WOMAN WHO WAS THE DRAGON'S GRANDMOTHER
ONCE THERE LIVED A KING WHO HAD NO CHILDREN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER HIS MARRIAGE AT LENGTH HEAVEN GRANTED HIM A DAUGHTER OF SUCH REMARKABLE BEAUTY THAT HE COULD THINK OF NO NAME SO APPROPRIATE FOR HER AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRY
SHE NOTICED THAT THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PRODUCE A BRILLIANT RAINBOW SHE STOOD STILL TO ADMIRE IT WHEN TO HER GREAT SURPRISE SHE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESSING HER WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE CENTRE OF ITS RAYS
AS TO CERTAIN DEATH AS SHE WAS CROSSING A WOOD A BIRD SANG TO HER TO PICK UP A SHINING PEBBLE WHICH SHE WOULD FIND IN A FOUNTAIN CLOSE BY AND TO USE IT WHEN NEEDED
SHE TOOK THE BIRD'S ADVICE AND IN DUE TIME ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF LOCRINOS LUCKILY SHE ONLY FOUND HIS WIFE AT HOME WHO WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE PRINCESS'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY AND SWEET GENTLE MANNERS
SHE READILY LET FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAVE THE FIRE
AND FOR SOME TIME THE LOVERS ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF SUNSHINE TOGETHER ONE DAY PRINCE RAINBOW APPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF WOE HE HAD JUST HEARD THAT HE WAS TO BE BANISHED FROM THIS LOVELY SPOT BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS TO GO
FAIRER THAN A FAIRY EAGERLY RAN TO THE WINDOW BUT IN HER HASTE SHE UPSET THE BASIN AND SPILT ALL THE WATER WITH WHICH SHE HAD CAREFULLY FILLED IT OVERNIGHT NO OTHER WATER WAS AT HAND EXCEPT THAT IN THE TWO BOTTLES
AND ARRIVED JUST AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAD FALLEN FAST ASLEEP THIS TIME SHE MADE SURE OF CATCHING HER VICTIM BUT THE CAT SPIED HER OUT
FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FELT A STRONG DESIRE TO ENTER THIS CASTLE BUT BESIDES BEING HUNG A LITTLE ABOVE THE GROUND THERE SEEMED TO BE NEITHER DOORS NOR WINDOWS SHE HAD NO DOUBT THOUGH REALLY I CANNOT THINK WHY
SHE ENTERED A MAGNIFICENT ROOM WHICH APPEARED TO OCCUPY THE ENTIRE CASTLE AND WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY GOLD AND JEWELLED STARS IN THE CEILING
AND THAT HE MIGHT RETURN IN PEACE TO REIGN OVER HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE LONGING FOR HIS PRESENCE THE COURT RECEIVED THE NEW KING WITH JOYFUL ACCLAMATIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED HIM AT ANY OTHER TIME
FAR AWAY IN NORTH AMERICA WHERE THE RED INDIANS DWELL
VERY SOON HE NOTICED WITH WONDER THAT NEITHER ROCKS NOR TREES BARRED HIS PATH HE PASSED THROUGH THEM WITHOUT KNOWING IT FOR INDEED THEY WERE NOT ROCKS AND TREES AT ALL BUT ONLY THE SOULS OF THEM FOR THIS WAS THE LAND OF SHADOWS
THEY ENTERED THE CASTLE AND WALKED THROUGH TWELVE SPLENDID HALLS ALL MADE OF GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE TWELFTH ROOM THEY FOUND THE MOTHER DRAGON SEATED ON A DIAMOND THRONE SHE WAS THE
AND AGAIN SHE LED HIM TO THE BALL ROOM THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM SAFE AND SOUND AND WHEN THEY WERE DANCING TOGETHER SHE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR IF YOU SUCCEED AGAIN TO MORROW WAIT FOR ME WITH THE FOAL IN THE MEADOW
AFTER THE BALL WE WILL FLY AWAY TOGETHER ON THE THIRD DAY THE PRINCE LED THE MARE TO THE MEADOW AGAIN BUT ONCE MORE SHE VANISHED BEFORE HIS EYES THEN THE PRINCE TOOK OUT HIS LITTLE BELL AND RANG IT THREE TIMES
SHE SAID TO HIM YOU ARE A BRAVE YOUTH AND I WILL MAKE YOU MY BODY SERVANT BUT WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU AS A REWARD TO BEGIN WITH
THE PRINCE AND SHE FLEW LIKE THE WIND TILL THEY REACHED THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DWELLING BUT THE DRAGONS HAD NOTICED THEIR FLIGHT AND WOKE THEIR BROTHER OUT OF HIS YEAR'S SLEEP HE FLEW INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE WHEN HE HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED
THIS LITTLE WORK WAS FINISHED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN O THREE AND INTENDED FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION IT WAS DISPOSED OF TO A BOOKSELLER IT WAS EVEN ADVERTISED
THE PUBLIC ARE ENTREATED TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE IT WAS FINISHED MANY MORE SINCE IT WAS BEGUN AND THAT DURING THAT PERIOD PLACES MANNERS BOOKS AND OPINIONS HAVE UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE CHANGES
CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY
BUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY MISTER ALLEN
SHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEM
CHAPTER THIRTY CATHERINE'S DISPOSITION WAS NOT NATURALLY SEDENTARY NOR HAD HER HABITS BEEN EVER VERY INDUSTRIOUS BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HITHERTO HAVE BEEN HER DEFECTS OF THAT SORT
CATHERINE TOOK UP HER WORK DIRECTLY SAYING IN A DEJECTED VOICE THAT HER HEAD DID NOT RUN UPON BATH MUCH THEN YOU ARE FRETTING ABOUT GENERAL TILNEY AND THAT IS VERY SIMPLE OF YOU
APPLIED TO HER WORK BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES SUNK AGAIN WITHOUT KNOWING IT HERSELF INTO LANGUOR AND LISTLESSNESS MOVING HERSELF IN HER CHAIR FROM THE IRRITATION OF WEARINESS MUCH OFTENER THAN SHE MOVED HER NEEDLE
HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER
SHE KNEW NOT THAT A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES TILL ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST OBJECT SHE BEHELD WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
AND ON DEVELOPING FROM AMIDST ALL HER PERPLEXITY OF WORDS IN REPLY THE MEANING WHICH ONE SHORT SYLLABLE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO THEM AND
ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW HIM THE WAY YOU MAY SEE THE HOUSE FROM THIS WINDOW SIR WAS INFORMATION ON SARAH'S SIDE WHICH PRODUCED ONLY A BOW OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE GENTLEMAN AND A SILENCING NOD FROM HER MOTHER
AND DELIGHTED IN ALL THE EXCELLENCIES OF HER CHARACTER AND TRULY LOVED HER SOCIETY I MUST CONFESS THAT HIS AFFECTION ORIGINATED IN NOTHING BETTER THAN GRATITUDE OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT A PERSUASION OF HER PARTIALITY FOR HIM
AND BEING AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN DAILY EXPECTATION OF MORLAND'S ENGAGING ISABELLA BUT LIKEWISE PRETTY WELL RESOLVED UPON MARRYING CATHERINE HIMSELF
BEEN CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF GIVING THE YOUNG PEOPLE EVEN A DECENT SUPPORT THEY WERE IN FACT A NECESSITOUS FAMILY NUMEROUS TOO ALMOST BEYOND EXAMPLE BY NO MEANS RESPECTED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
THE TERRIFIED GENERAL PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF ALLEN WITH AN INQUIRING LOOK AND HERE TOO THORPE HAD LEARNT HIS ERROR THE ALLENS HE BELIEVED HAD LIVED NEAR THEM TOO LONG
IN WHAT POINTS HIS OWN CONJECTURES MIGHT ASSIST HIM AND WHAT PORTION MUST YET REMAIN TO BE TOLD IN A LETTER FROM JAMES
THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM AT NORTHANGER HAD BEEN OF THE MOST UNFRIENDLY KIND HENRY'S INDIGNATION ON HEARING HOW CATHERINE HAD BEEN TREATED ON COMPREHENDING HIS FATHER'S VIEWS AND BEING ORDERED TO ACQUIESCE IN THEM
HAD BEEN OPEN AND BOLD THE GENERAL ACCUSTOMED ON EVERY ORDINARY OCCASION TO GIVE THE LAW IN HIS FAMILY PREPARED FOR NO RELUCTANCE BUT OF FEELING
THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS IN HIS ANGER AND THEY PARTED IN DREADFUL DISAGREEMENT HENRY IN AN AGITATION OF MIND WHICH MANY SOLITARY HOURS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPOSE
A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON FROM THE FRIVOLOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY WHO HAD BEGUN TO TAKE THE MEASURE OF EUROPE ON THE LAWN AT GARDENCOURT A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE
SHE HAD LEFT HER HUSBAND BEHIND HER BUT HAD BROUGHT HER CHILDREN TO WHOM ISABEL NOW PLAYED WITH EQUAL MUNIFICENCE AND TENDERNESS THE PART OF MAIDEN AUNT MISTER LUDLOW
THE LITTLE LUDLOWS HAD NOT YET EVEN FROM THE AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW
THE TROPHIES LILY'S CONCEPTION OF SUCH ACHIEVEMENTS WAS EXTREMELY VAGUE BUT THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED OF ISABEL TO GIVE IT FORM AND BODY
SET HER RIGHT AGAIN SHE WAS SO FOND OF THE SPECTACLE OF HUMAN LIFE THAT SHE ENJOYED EVEN THE ASPECT OF GATHERING DUSK IN THE LONDON STREETS THE MOVING CROWDS THE HURRYING CABS THE LIGHTED SHOPS THE FLARING STALLS THE DARK
IN THE SEPTEMBER PREVIOUS HAD BEEN RECALLED TO AMERICA BY A TELEGRAM FROM THE INTERVIEWER
BUT SHE ADDED THAT SHE HERSELF HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSUMED WITH THE DESIRE TO VISIT ATHENS AND CONSTANTINOPLE THE TWO LADIES ACCORDINGLY EMBARKED ON THIS EXPEDITION AND SPENT THREE MONTHS IN GREECE IN TURKEY IN EGYPT
ADVANTAGEOUS TO HEAR SHE HAD ONCE OR TWICE HAD A POSITIVE SCARE SINCE IT SO AFFECTED HER TO HAVE TO EXCLAIM OF HER FRIEND
DURING WHICH THE FACT OF HER BEING WITH HIS OLD FRIEND MADAME MERLE IN WHOSE HOUSE SHE HAD GONE TO LODGE MADE IT VIRTUALLY INEVITABLE THAT HE SHOULD SEE HER EVERY DAY WHEN THE LAST OF APRIL CAME
SHE SEEMED INDIFFERENT TO HER POSSESSIONS WAS NOT HALF SO SOLICITOUS ABOUT THEM AS HER FRIENDS WERE SHE WAS TALL DARK SEVERE WITH SOMETHING INDIAN LIKE IN THE RIGID IMMOBILITY OF HER FACE HER MANNER WAS COLD AND SHE TALKED LITTLE
GUESTS FELT THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING NOT CONFERRING A FAVOR WHEN THEY STAYED AT HER HOUSE EVEN THE SMARTEST TRAVELING MEN WERE FLATTERED WHEN MISSUS GARDENER STOPPED TO CHAT WITH THEM FOR A MOMENT
WHEN HE WAS THREE WEEKS OLD HE HAD AN ILLNESS WHICH LEFT HIM TOTALLY BLIND
AND HIS MAMMY SAID HE WAS N'T ALL WRONG SHE NAMED HIM SAMSON BECAUSE HE WAS BLIND BUT ON THE PLANTATION HE WAS KNOWN AS YELLOW MARTHA'S SIMPLE CHILD
HE WAS DOCILE AND OBEDIENT BUT WHEN HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD HE BEGAN TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME ALWAYS TAKING THE SAME DIRECTION HE FELT HIS WAY THROUGH THE LILACS ALONG THE BOXWOOD HEDGE
HE SEEMED TO KNOW THAT IT MUST BE DONE WITH THE FINGERS NOT WITH THE FISTS OR THE FEET HE APPROACHED THIS HIGHLY ARTIFICIAL INSTRUMENT THROUGH A MERE INSTINCT AND COUPLED HIMSELF TO IT AS IF HE KNEW IT WAS TO PIECE HIM OUT AND MAKE A WHOLE CREATURE OF HIM
THAT LAY UNDER THE BONES OF HIS PINCHED CONICAL LITTLE SKULL DEFINITE AS ANIMAL DESIRES THE DOOR OPENED MISS NELLIE AND HER MUSIC MASTER STOOD BEHIND IT BUT BLIND SAMSON WHO WAS SO SENSITIVE TO PRESENCES DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE THERE
AS PIANO PLAYING IT WAS PERHAPS ABOMINABLE BUT AS MUSIC IT WAS SOMETHING REAL VITALIZED BY A SENSE OF RHYTHM THAT WAS STRONGER THAN HIS OTHER PHYSICAL SENSES THAT NOT ONLY FILLED HIS DARK MIND BUT WORRIED HIS BODY INCESSANTLY
SOMEBODY DANCING IN THERE HE JERKED HIS BULLET HEAD TOWARD THE DINING ROOM I HEAR LITTLE FEET GIRLS I SPECT ANSON KIRKPATRICK MOUNTED A CHAIR AND PEEPED OVER THE TRANSOM
SHE LOOKED BOLD AND RESOURCEFUL AND UNSCRUPULOUS AND SHE WAS ALL OF THESE THEY WERE HANDSOME GIRLS HAD THE FRESH COLOR OF THEIR COUNTRY UP BRINGING AND IN THEIR EYES THAT BRILLIANCY WHICH IS CALLED BY NO METAPHOR ALAS
OR THE WAY HE LOOKED AT HER I FEEL AS IF HE IS UP TO SOME OF HIS TRICKS AGAIN
THE MAN BECAME INSANE HE STOOD OVER ME CHOKING ME WITH ONE FIST AND BEATING ME IN THE FACE WITH THE OTHER HISSING AND CHUCKLING AND LETTING OUT A FLOOD OF ABUSE SO THIS IS WHAT SHE'S UP TO WHEN I'M AWAY IS IT WHERE IS SHE YOU NASTY WHELP
AND ONE EYE WAS SWOLLEN SHUT AND HIDEOUSLY DISCOLORED GRANDMOTHER SAID WE MUST HAVE THE DOCTOR AT ONCE BUT I IMPLORED HER AS I HAD NEVER BEGGED FOR ANYTHING BEFORE NOT TO SEND FOR HIM I COULD STAND ANYTHING I TOLD HER
IF THE STORY ONCE GOT ABROAD I WOULD NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT I COULD WELL IMAGINE WHAT THE OLD MEN DOWN AT THE DRUG STORE WOULD DO WITH SUCH A THEME
AND HAD LEFT AGAIN ON THE SIX O'CLOCK TRAIN FOR DENVER THAT MORNING THE AGENT SAID HIS FACE WAS STRIPED WITH COURT PLASTER AND HE CARRIED HIS LEFT HAND IN A SLING HE LOOKED SO USED UP THAT THE AGENT ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM SINCE TEN O'CLOCK THE NIGHT BEFORE
MY OWN GARMENTS HAD BEEN TREATED SO BADLY THAT I NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN GRANDMOTHER BURNED THEM IN THE CUTTERS KITCHEN RANGE WHILE ANTONIA WAS PACKING HER TRUNK AND PUTTING HER ROOM IN ORDER TO LEAVE IT THE FRONT DOOR BELL RANG VIOLENTLY
ANTONIA WAS FRIGHTENED AND WAS GOING HOME TO STAY FOR A WHILE SHE TOLD MISSUS CUTTER IT WOULD BE USELESS TO INTERROGATE THE GIRL FOR SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEN MISSUS CUTTER TOLD HER STORY
BROUGHT INTO THE BARE ROOM THE SOFTNESS OF THE SKY THE LANGUOR OF THE EARTH THE BEWITCHING BREATH OF THE EASTERN WATERS THERE WERE PERFUMES IN IT SUGGESTIONS OF INFINITE REPOSE THE GIFT OF ENDLESS DREAMS
HE ASSOCIATED NATURALLY WITH THE MEN OF HIS CALLING IN THE PORT THESE WERE OF TWO KINDS SOME VERY FEW AND SEEN THERE BUT SELDOM LED MYSTERIOUS LIVES
AND WHEN CLEAR OF CONFINING RAILS SPREAD ON ALL SIDES OVER THE DECK FLOWED FORWARD AND AFT OVERFLOWED DOWN THE YAWNING HATCHWAYS FILLED THE INNER RECESSES OF THE SHIP LIKE WATER FILLING A CISTERN
COMING FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AND FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE EAST AFTER TREADING THE JUNGLE PATHS DESCENDING THE RIVERS COASTING IN PRAUS ALONG THE SHALLOWS CROSSING IN SMALL CANOES FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND PASSING THROUGH SUFFERING
AND ON THE SECRET PURPOSES OF THEIR HEARTS THE STEAMER POUNDED IN THE DUSK THE CALM WATER OF THE STRAIT AND FAR ASTERN OF THE PILGRIM SHIP A SCREW PILE LIGHTHOUSE PLANTED BY UNBELIEVERS ON A TREACHEROUS SHOAL SEEMED TO WINK AT HER
AND THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY WAS BEING HELD IN THE POLICE COURT OF AN EASTERN PORT HE STOOD ELEVATED IN THE WITNESS BOX WITH BURNING CHEEKS IN A COOL LOFTY ROOM
WHO WANTED FACTS AFTER HIS FIRST FEELING OF REVOLT HE HAD COME ROUND TO THE VIEW THAT ONLY A METICULOUS PRECISION OF STATEMENT WOULD BRING OUT THE TRUE HORROR BEHIND THE APPALLING FACE OF THINGS
THE FACTS THOSE MEN WERE SO EAGER TO KNOW HAD BEEN VISIBLE TANGIBLE OPEN TO THE SENSES OCCUPYING THEIR PLACE IN SPACE AND TIME REQUIRING FOR THEIR EXISTENCE A FOURTEEN HUNDRED TON STEAMER
PERDITION THAT DWELT WITHIN LIKE A MALEVOLENT SOUL IN A DETESTABLE BODY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE THIS CLEAR THIS HAD NOT BEEN A COMMON AFFAIR EVERYTHING IN IT HAD BEEN OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
FELT A SHIVER RUN DOWN HIS BACK THE BIG ASSESSOR HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS AND DRUMMED ON WITHOUT A SOUND CARELESS AND MOURNFUL THE EYES OF THE OTHER ABOVE THE SUNBURNT CLASPED FINGERS
AND IN DRILL SUITS THAT SEEMED TO FIT THEM AS CLOSE AS THEIR SKINS AND HOLDING THEIR ROUND PITH HATS ON THEIR KNEES WHILE GLIDING ALONG THE WALLS THE COURT PEONS BUTTONED TIGHT IN LONG WHITE COATS FLITTED RAPIDLY TO AND FRO
AND AUDIBLY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AFTER DINNER ON A VERANDAH DRAPED IN MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS IN THE DEEP DUSK SPECKLED BY FIERY CIGAR ENDS THE ELONGATED BULK OF EACH CANE CHAIR
OVERSHADOWED BY A FRAGMENT OF AN UNRUFFLED FOREHEAD AND WITH THE VERY FIRST WORD UTTERED MARLOW'S BODY EXTENDED AT REST IN THE SEAT WOULD BECOME VERY STILL AS THOUGH HIS SPIRIT HAD WINGED ITS WAY BACK INTO THE LAPSE OF TIME
AT HIS BACK WAS THE DARK NIGHT WITH THE CLEAR STARS WHOSE DISTANT GLITTER DISPOSED IN RETREATING PLANES LURED THE EYE INTO THE DEPTHS OF A GREATER DARKNESS
LIKE THIS HE SAID IT DOES ME GOOD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME YOU DON'T WORDS SEEMED TO FAIL HIM IT WAS A DISTINCT GLIMPSE HE WAS A YOUNGSTER OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO SEE ABOUT YOU
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR A FELLOW IN MY POSITION TO BE BELIEVED MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO AN ELDER MAN IT IS SO DIFFICULT SO AWFULLY UNFAIR SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
SURELY IN NO OTHER CRAFT AS IN THAT OF THE SEA DO THE HEARTS OF THOSE ALREADY LAUNCHED TO SINK OR SWIM GO OUT SO MUCH TO THE YOUTH ON THE BRINK LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES UPON THAT
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GREED OF ADVENTURES THAT ARE THEIR OWN AND ONLY REWARD WHAT WE GET WELL WE WON'T TALK OF THAT BUT CAN ONE OF US RESTRAIN A SMILE
AND HE HAD BEEN DELIBERATING UPON DEATH CONFOUND HIM HE HAD FOUND THAT TO MEDITATE ABOUT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE WHILE ALL ITS GLAMOUR HAD GONE WITH THE SHIP IN THE NIGHT WHAT MORE NATURAL
BUT IT WASN'T TRUTH ALL THE SAME IT WAS SOMETHING ONE KNOWS A DOWNRIGHT LIE THERE WAS NOT THE THICKNESS OF A SHEET OF PAPER BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF THIS AFFAIR
HE PRONOUNCED WITH A CONVULSIVE EFFORT WHOSE STRESS AS IF PROPAGATED BY THE WAVES OF THE AIR MADE MY BODY STIR A LITTLE IN THE CHAIR HE FIXED ME WITH LOWERING EYES DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME HE CRIED I SWEAR
A LITTLE VICIOUSLY I FEAR DON'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CRAFT I WAS AGGRIEVED AGAINST HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CHEATED ME
I WISH I'D ASKED HER TO WRITE TO ME THOUGH HE THOUGHT AND YET
BUT THAT SORT OF GLOW DIES OUT MEMORY GETS SADLY DILUTED WITH TIME AND IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REVIVE US ADAM WAS NO LONGER SO CONFIDENT AS HE HAD BEEN HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PERHAPS DINAH'S OLD LIFE
WOULD HAVE TOO STRONG A GRASP UPON HER
IT WOULD BE WORSE TO HAVE A DISCOURAGING ANSWER BY LETTER THAN FROM HER OWN LIPS FOR HER PRESENCE RECONCILED HIM TO HER WILL YOU PERCEIVE HOW IT WAS ADAM WAS HUNGERING FOR THE SIGHT OF DINAH
THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO SNOWFIELD ON HORSEBACK THIS TIME FOR HIS HOURS WERE PRECIOUS NOW AND HE HAD BORROWED JONATHAN BURGE'S GOOD NAG FOR THE JOURNEY WHAT KEEN MEMORIES WENT ALONG THE ROAD WITH HIM
THE STORY OF THAT PAINFUL PAST WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL BY HEART BUT NO STORY IS THE SAME TO US AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME OR RATHER WE WHO READ IT ARE NO LONGER THE SAME INTERPRETERS AND ADAM
WE CAN NO MORE WISH TO RETURN TO A NARROWER SYMPATHY THAN A PAINTER OR A MUSICIAN CAN WISH TO RETURN TO HIS CRUDER MANNER OR A PHILOSOPHER TO HIS LESS COMPLETE FORMULA
OCTOBER SUNSHINE THAN IT HAD IN THE EAGER TIME OF EARLY SPRING AND THE ONE GRAND CHARM IT POSSESSED IN COMMON WITH ALL WIDE STRETCHING WOODLESS REGIONS
THAT IT FILLED YOU WITH A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE OVERARCHING SKY HAD A MILDER MORE SOOTHING INFLUENCE THAN USUAL ON THIS ALMOST CLOUDLESS DAY ADAM'S DOUBTS AND FEARS MELTED UNDER THIS INFLUENCE
THE LITTLE GREY DESOLATE LOOKING HAMLET UNSCREENED BY SHELTERING TREES LAY IN SIGHT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED IT AND AS HE CAME NEAR HE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF VOICES SINGING A HYMN
SHE WAS MUCH LONGER COMING THAN HE EXPECTED HE WAITED AN HOUR AT LEAST WATCHING FOR HER AND THINKING OF HER WHILE THE AFTERNOON SHADOWS LENGTHENED AND THE LIGHT GREW SOFTER AT LAST HE SAW THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE
COMING FROM BETWEEN THE GREY HOUSES AND GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE FOOT OF THE HILL SLOWLY ADAM THOUGHT BUT DINAH WAS REALLY WALKING AT HER USUAL PACE WITH A LIGHT QUIET STEP
ADAM WAS GLAD FOR WITH THE FINE INSTINCT OF A LOVER HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR HER TO HEAR HIS VOICE BEFORE SHE SAW HIM HE CAME WITHIN THREE PACES OF HER AND THEN SAID DINAH
HEAT THEM IN THE SOUP AND SERVE TIME
BUT BY THE END OF AUGUST THEY BECOME HEALTHY HAVING RECOVERED FROM THE EFFECTS OF SPAWNING WHEN THEY ARE NOT IN SEASON THE MALES HAVE A BLACK
THE PRICKLY STAR CREEPS ON WITH FULL DECEIT TO FORCE THE OYSTER FROM HIS CLOSE RETREAT WHEN GAPING LIDS THEIR WIDEN'D VOID DISPLAY THE WATCHFUL STAR THRUSTS IN A POINTED RAY OF ALL ITS TREASURES SPOILS THE RIFLED CASE
PRAWN SOUP
TWO PINTS OF PRAWNS THE CRUMBS OF A FRENCH ROLL ANCHOVY SAUCE OR MUSHROOM KETCHUP TO TASTE ONE BLADE OF MACE ONE PINT OF VINEGAR A LITTLE LEMON JUICE MODE
RUB THEM THROUGH A TAMMY AND MIX THEM BY DEGREES WITH THE SOUP ADD KETCHUP OR ANCHOVY SAUCE TO TASTE WITH A LITTLE LEMON JUICE WHEN IT IS WELL COOKED PUT IN A FEW PICKED PRAWNS LET THEM GET THOROUGHLY HOT AND SERVE
IF MADE WITH WATER SEASONABLE AT ANY TIME SUFFICIENT FOR EIGHT PERSONS NOTE THIS CAN BE THICKENED WITH TOMATOES AND VERMICELLI SERVED IN IT
THIS LITTLE FISH BEARS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THE SHRIMP BUT IS NEITHER SO COMMON NOR SO SMALL
HER HEAD WAS STILL BENT AND HER VOICE WAS SO LOW AS TO BE ALMOST INAUDIBLE TELL YOU WHAT SHE ASKED WHAT YOU KNOW OF THIS BUSINESS HE SAID DON'T YOU REALISE HOW EVERY NEW DEVELOPMENT BRINGS YOU MORE AND MORE UNDER SUSPICION
ODETTE ODETTE HE WHISPERED DON'T YOU REALISE THAT I LOVE YOU AND WOULD GIVE MY LIFE TO SAVE YOU FROM UNHAPPINESS WON'T YOU TELL ME EVERYTHING PLEASE NO NO NO SHE MURMURED WITH A LITTLE CATCH IN HER VOICE PLEASE DON'T ASK ME
I AM AFRAID OH I AM AFRAID HE CRUSHED HER IN HIS ARMS HIS CHEEK AGAINST HERS HIS LIPS TINGLING WITH THE CARESS OF HER HAIR BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF NOTHING HE SAID EAGERLY IF YOU WERE AS GUILTY AS HELL I WOULD SAVE YOU
THERE WAS A MAN STANDING IN THE DOORWAY IN THE ACT OF CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM MILBURGH HE SAID BETWEEN HIS TEETH MILBURGH SMILED THE OTHER MOCKINGLY I AM SORRY TO INTERRUPT THIS BEAUTIFUL SCENE
BUT THE OCCASION IS A DESPERATE ONE AND I CANNOT AFFORD TO STAND ON CEREMONY MISTER TARLING TARLING PUT THE GIRL FROM HIM AND LOOKED AT THE SMIRKING MANAGER ONE COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE THE DETECTIVE GAVE HIM
AND PULLED FROM HIS POCKET A CHAIN AT THE END OF WHICH DANGLED A SMALL BUNCH OF KEYS HERE IS THE KEY HE SAID UNLOCK AND READ TO NIGHT TARLING TOOK THE KEY IN HIS HAND INSERTED IT IN FIRST ONE TINY LOCK AND THEN IN THE OTHER
THE CATCHES SNAPPED OPEN AND HE THREW BACK THE FLAP THEN A HAND SNATCHED THE PORTFOLIO FROM HIM AND HE TURNED TO SEE THE GIRL'S QUIVERING FACE AND READ THE TERROR IN HER EYES NO NO SHE CRIED ALMOST BESIDE HERSELF NO FOR GOD'S SAKE NO
UNDER HER GREAT DETERMINATION TO KEEP GWENDOLEN IN HER OWN CARE BUT WITH JUPP TO WATCH THE DOCK AND A MAN IN PLAIN CLOTHES AT THE DOOR OF THE SMALL HOTEL SHE WAS AT PRESENT BOUND FOR I THOUGHT I MIGHT REMAIN IN YONKERS CONTENTEDLY THE WHOLE DAY
THE DOCTOR SAYS SHE WILL NOT LIVE TO SEE HER HUSBAND UNLESS SOMETHING COMES TO ROUSE HER BUT THE PAPERS GIVE NO NEWS AND ALL THE ATTEMPTS OF THE POLICE END IN NOTHING
YOU SAW WHAT A DISMAL FAILURE THEIR LAST ATTEMPT WAS THE CHILD ON WHICH THEY COUNTED PROVED TO BE BOTH RED HAIRED AND POCK MARKED GWENDOLEN APPEARS TO BE LOST LOST
MISSUS OCUMPAUGH WE MAY NEVER HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT TOGETHER IN CONFIDENCE THERE IS ONE THING I HAVE NEVER TOLD YOU SOMETHING WHICH I THINK YOU OUGHT TO KNOW AS IT MAY AFFECT YOUR WHOLE FUTURE COURSE
IT CONCERNS GWENDOLEN'S REAL MOTHER YOU SAY YOU DO NOT KNOW HER NO
MY DARLING IS HAPPY WITH MISSUS CAREW TOO HAPPY
A STRING OF BEADS WHICH WERE BOTH VALUABLE AND OF EXQUISITE WORKMANSHIP I KNOW BECAUSE IT BROKE JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING AND THE BEADS FELL ALL OVER THE FLOOR AND ONE ROLLED MY WAY AND I PICKED IT UP SCAMP THAT I WAS
TILL YESTERDAY YESTERDAY HER GREAT EYES HAGGARD WITH SUFFERING ROSE TO MINE THEN THEY FELL ON THE BEAD WHICH I HAD TAKEN FROM MY POCKET THE CRY SHE GAVE WAS NOT LOUD BUT IT EFFECTUALLY SETTLED ALL MY DOUBTS
FEELING MY POSITION KEENLY I WALKED TO THE WINDOW BUT SOON TURNED AND CAME BACK IN RESPONSE TO HER CRY I MUST SEE MISSUS CAREW INSTANTLY
THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE WHEN WE REACHED THE TREE THE CORONER EXAMINED THE GROUND AROUND IT CAREFULLY WHEN HE AROSE HE SEEMED DISAPPOINTED WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO FIND HERE I ASKED
SHE BEGGED FORGIVENESS FOR SOME FANCIED WRONG AND REPEATED THAT A CERTAIN MAN WAS NOT GUILTY OF DISHONESTY BUT HER FIRST WEIRD CRY HAD TO DO WITH THE MURDER I'M SURE
EVERYTHING POINTS TO AN AEROPLANE IT WAS DONE A HUNDRED YES A THOUSAND TIMES IN THE WAR WHILE I WAS OVER THERE WITH MY HOSPITAL UNIT WE USED TO GET A LOT OF CASES OF MOTORCYCLE DESPATCH RIDERS WHO HAD BEEN PICKED OFF BY GERMAN AVIATORS
DID YOU SEE HIM AT THAT TIME
OH HIS ALIBI IS GOOD OF COURSE BECAUSE HE WAS AROUND THE CLUB ALL THAT EVENING I GUESS HE WAS HERE AND I DON'T REMEMBER IT I SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND LEFT FAR OUT ON THE GOLF LINKS THE CORONER WAS BENDING OVER EXAMINING SOMETHING ON THE GROUND
SOME OF THE CROWDS BEGAN TO SHOUT WITH THE DISCIPLES A GREAT CRY OF HOSANNA WENT RINGING DOWN THE STREET EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE SAYING IT
OTHERS WERE SELLING DOVES FOR SACRIFICE THE POOR HAD TO PAY HEAVILY TO WORSHIP GOD IN HIS OWN HOUSE JESUS STRODE DOWN THE ROOM WITH THE WHIP IN HIS HAND AND UPSET THE TABLES WHERE THE MONEY WAS
TAKE THE REWARD HE HAS PLANNED FOR YOU TO HAVE FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME FOOD I WAS THIRSTY AND YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK I WAS A STRANGER AND YOU TOOK ME INTO YOUR HOMES
I HAD NOTHING TO WEAR AND YOU GAVE ME CLOTHES I WAS SICK AND IN PRISON AND YOU CAME TO VISIT ME THEN THESE PEOPLE WILL BE SURPRISED AND SAY LORD WHEN DID WE EVER DO ANYTHING FOR YOU
IF WE HAD SEEN YOU NEEDING ANYTHING WE WOULD HAVE HELPED YOU AND I WILL SAY MANY POOR PEOPLE NEEDED YOUR HELP AND YOU DID NOT HELP THEM WHEN YOU FAILED THEM YOU FAILED ME AND NOW IT IS TOO LATE
THEY WERE AT THEIR WITS END TO KNOW HOW TO GET RID OF JESUS THE CRAFTIEST MEN IN JERUSALEM COULD NOT THINK WHAT TO DO THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR IT WAS ONE OF JESUS TWELVE DISCIPLES
SO FOR THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER JUDAS AGREED TO SHOW THEM WHERE JESUS WAS AT SOME TIME WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE AROUND BUT THE TWELVE DISCIPLES SEND SOLDIERS WHEN I TELL YOU JUDAS SAID
FRIDAY WAS A COMFORTABLE DAY IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF KING EVERYBODY WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR THE STORY GIRL SPARKLED THROUGH SEVERAL TALES THAT RANGED FROM THE AFRITES AND JINNS OF EASTERN MYTH THROUGH THE PIPING DAYS OF CHIVALRY DOWN TO THE HOMELY ANECDOTES OF CARLISLE WORKADAY FOLKS
THE NUMBER OF EGGS SHE USED IN IT WOULD HAVE SHOCKED AUNT JANET'S THRIFTY SOUL BUT THAT CAKE LIKE BEAUTY WAS ITS OWN EXCUSE UNCLE ROGER ATE THREE SLICES OF IT AT TEA TIME AND TOLD FELICITY SHE WAS AN ARTIST
THEY AND ONLY THEY CAN BRING US TIDINGS FROM THAT DEAR COUNTRY WHERE WE ONCE SOJOURNED AND FROM WHICH WE MUST EVERMORE BE EXILES THE WORLD CALLS THEM ITS SINGERS AND POETS AND ARTISTS AND STORY TELLERS
AS WE SAT THERE THE AWKWARD MAN PASSED BY WITH HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HIS DOG AT HIS SIDE HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE AN AWKWARD MAN THERE IN THE HEART OF THE MAPLE WOODS
IF I PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER IT WILL BE TOO LATE I'M GROWING SO FAST AUNT OLIVIA SAYS I'LL HAVE TO WEAR ANKLE SKIRTS NEXT SUMMER IF I BEGIN TO LOOK GROWN UP HE'LL GET FRIGHTENED OF ME AND THEN I'LL NEVER FIND OUT THE GOLDEN MILESTONE MYSTERY
AND I GOT BACK ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO I SET DOWN ON THE FRONT DOOR STEPS FOR A MOMENT AND ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A BELL RING IN THE HOUSE EIGHT TIMES I TELL YOU I WAS SKEERED I MADE A BOLT FOR THE ORCHARD AND YOU WON'T CATCH ME GOING NEAR THAT HOUSE TILL YOUR UNCLE ROGER COMES HOME
HE STRUGGLED OUT OF MY CLASP AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE LONG GRASSES WITH SOUNDLESS LEAPS
HE WAS A STRANGE FURTIVE ANIMAL A QUESTING BEAST PRESENTLY THE MOON ROSE BUT THIS ONLY MADE MATTERS WORSE THE SHADOWS HAD BEEN STILL BEFORE NOW THEY MOVED AND DANCED AS THE NIGHT WIND TOSSED THE BOUGHS THE OLD HOUSE WITH ITS DREADFUL SECRET
WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL UNCLE ROGER STOPPED LAUGHING BEFORE WE HEARD THE EXPLANATION WE THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD STOP
AND NOW IT HAS ALMOST FRIGHTENED YOU POOR LITTLE MONKEYS TO DEATH WE HEARD UNCLE ROGER CHUCKLING ALL THE WAY TO THE BARN
WHEN EDWARD INTERRUPTED HER BY SAYING YOU MUST NOT ENQUIRE TOO FAR MARIANNE REMEMBER I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE IN THE PICTURESQUE AND I SHALL OFFEND YOU BY MY IGNORANCE AND WANT OF TASTE IF WE COME TO PARTICULARS
WHICH OUGHT TO BE IRREGULAR AND RUGGED AND DISTANT OBJECTS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE INDISTINCT THROUGH THE SOFT MEDIUM OF A HAZY ATMOSPHERE YOU MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH ADMIRATION AS I CAN HONESTLY GIVE I CALL IT A VERY FINE COUNTRY
IS BECOME A MERE JARGON EVERY BODY PRETENDS TO FEEL AND TRIES TO DESCRIBE WITH THE TASTE AND ELEGANCE OF HIM WHO FIRST DEFINED WHAT PICTURESQUE BEAUTY WAS I DETEST JARGON OF EVERY KIND AND SOMETIMES I HAVE KEPT MY FEELINGS TO MYSELF
BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEM IN BUT WHAT WAS WORN AND HACKNEYED OUT OF ALL SENSE AND MEANING I AM CONVINCED SAID EDWARD THAT YOU REALLY FEEL ALL THE DELIGHT IN A FINE PROSPECT WHICH YOU PROFESS TO FEEL
BUT IN RETURN YOUR SISTER MUST ALLOW ME TO FEEL NO MORE THAN I PROFESS I LIKE A FINE PROSPECT BUT NOT ON PICTURESQUE PRINCIPLES I DO NOT LIKE CROOKED TWISTED BLASTED TREES I ADMIRE THEM MUCH MORE IF THEY ARE TALL STRAIGHT AND FLOURISHING
I DO NOT LIKE RUINED TATTERED COTTAGES I AM NOT FOND OF NETTLES OR THISTLES OR HEATH BLOSSOMS I HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN A SNUG FARM HOUSE THAN A WATCH TOWER
BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER HAIR HAD BEEN DARKER MARIANNE SPOKE INCONSIDERATELY WHAT SHE REALLY FELT BUT WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH SHE HAD PAINED EDWARD HER OWN VEXATION AT HER WANT OF THOUGHT COULD NOT BE SURPASSED BY HIS
SHE WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR HOWEVER TO REGARD IT AS AN AFFRONT AND AFFECTING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT PASSED BY INSTANTLY TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE SHE INTERNALLY RESOLVED HENCEFORWARD TO CATCH EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF EYEING THE HAIR AND OF SATISFYING HERSELF BEYOND ALL DOUBT
BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY WERE VISITED BY SIR JOHN AND MISSUS JENNINGS WHO HAVING HEARD OF THE ARRIVAL OF A GENTLEMAN AT THE COTTAGE CAME TO TAKE A SURVEY OF THE GUEST WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS MOTHER IN LAW SIR JOHN WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING
EDWARD SAW ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND NOT ONLY THE MEANING OF OTHERS BUT SUCH OF MARIANNE'S EXPRESSIONS AS HAD PUZZLED HIM BEFORE AND WHEN THEIR VISITORS LEFT THEM HE WENT IMMEDIATELY ROUND HER AND SAID IN A WHISPER I HAVE BEEN GUESSING SHALL I TELL YOU MY GUESS
HOPE I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE HIM
TO THE THEATRE ACCORDINGLY THEY ALL WENT NO TILNEYS APPEARED TO PLAGUE OR PLEASE HER SHE FEARED THAT AMONGST THE MANY PERFECTIONS OF THE FAMILY A FONDNESS FOR PLAYS WAS NOT TO BE RANKED BUT PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE HABITUATED TO THE FINER PERFORMANCES OF THE LONDON STAGE
AND HE BEING HURRIED FOR TIME AND NOT CARING TO HAVE IT PUT OFF MADE A POINT OF HER BEING DENIED THAT WAS ALL I DO ASSURE YOU
SHE WAS UPON THE WHOLE LEFT ONE OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD WHILE TALKING TO EACH OTHER
WHEN THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS OVER THORPE CAME TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING OUT CATHERINE WAS THE IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF HIS GALLANTRY AND WHILE THEY WAITED IN THE LOBBY FOR A CHAIR HE PREVENTED THE INQUIRY WHICH HAD TRAVELLED FROM HER HEART ALMOST TO THE TIP OF HER TONGUE BY ASKING
LOWERING HIS VOICE WELL DONE GENERAL SAID I I AM QUITE OF YOUR MIND
THAT HE WHO SHOULD DISTINGUISH HIMSELF BY HIS SUPERIOR VALOUR AND WISDOM SHOULD UNANIMOUSLY BE ACKNOWLEDG'D THE SOVEREIGN ELECT A SPACIOUS LIST OR CIRCUS WAS PITCHED UPON SURROUNDED WITH COMMODIOUS SEATS
EXCEEDINGLY AWKWARD AND A MAN OF NO ACQUIR'D PARTS THE SYCOPHANTS THAT HOVER'D ROUND ABOUT HIM FLATTER'D HIM THAT A MAN OF HIS MERIT COULDN'T FAIL OF BEING KING HE IMPERIOUSLY REPLIED ONE OF MY MERIT MUST BE KING
AND AS HE HOBBLED ALONG SAID HE TO THE ESQUIRES WHAT A SAD MISFORTUNE IS THIS TO ONE OF MY BIRTH AND CHARACTER THE OTHER CHAMPIONS PLAY'D THEIR PARTS MUCH BETTER AND ALL CAME OFF WITH CREDIT
SOME CONQUER'D TWO OF THEIR ANTAGONISTS AND OTHERS WERE SO FAR SUCCESSFUL AS TO GET THE BETTER OF THREE NONE OF THEM HOWEVER EXCEPT PRINCE HOTTAM VANQUISH'D FOUR ZADIG AT LAST
ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITH THE UTMOST EASE AND WITH SUCH AN AIR AND GRACE AS GAIN'D HIM UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE AS THE CASE STOOD THUS ZADIG AND HOTTAM WERE TO CLOSE THE DAY'S ENTERTAINMENT IN A SINGLE COMBAT
THE QUEEN WHOSE HEART WAS IN A PERFECT PALPITATION PUT UP HER SECRET PRAYERS TO VENUS TO ASSIST HER DARLING HERO THE TWO CHAMPIONS MAKING THEIR PASSES AND THEIR VOLTA'S WITH THE UTMOST DEXTERITY AND ADDRESS
AND KEEPING FIRM IN THEIR SADDLES GAVE EACH OTHER SUCH REBUFFS WITH THEIR LANCES THAT ALL THE SPECTATORS THE QUEEN ONLY EXCEPTED WISH'D FOR TWO KINGS OF BABYLON AT LAST THEIR HORSES BEING TIRED AND BOTH THEIR LANCES BROKE
FOR BOTH WERE STRONG AND BOTH WERE ACTIVE THE FEATHERS OF THEIR HELMETS THE STUDS OF THEIR BRACELETS THEIR COATS OF MAIL FLEW ABOUT IN PIECES THRO THE DRY BLOWS WHICH THEY A THOUSAND TIMES REPEATED THEY STRUCK AT EACH OTHER SOMETIMES WITH THE EDGE OF THEIR SWORDS
THE POPULACE THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND IN THE CIRCUS HISS'D HIM EVERY STEP HE TOOK THEY MADE A RING ABOUT HIM AND TREATED HIM WITH ALL THE MARKS OF IGNOMINY AND CONTEMPT THE MOST COWARDLY WRETCH BREATHING WAS NEVER SURE SO SWEATED OR HUNTED DOWN AS POOR ZADIG
HE COULD NEVER RECOVER THE WHITE ARMOUR AGAIN WHICH SHE HAD SENT HIM THAT WAS THE COMPROMISE OR THE ENGAGEMENT TO WHICH THE COMBATANTS HAD ALL UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THUS AS HE WAS ON THE ONE HAND PLUNG'D IN AN ABYSS OF SORROW
THAT HIS IMPROPITIOUS STAR HAD SHED ITS MOST BALEFUL INFLUENCE ON HIM AND THAT HIS MISFORTUNES WERE IRRETRIEVABLE REVOLVING IN HIS MIND ALL HIS DISAPPOINTMENTS FROM HIS FIRST ADVENTURE WITH THE COURT COQUET
HE PUT ON THE GREEN ARMOUR THAT HAD CREATED HIM SUCH A WORLD OF DISGRACE A MERCHANT HAPPENING TO PASS BY HE SOLD IT TO HIM FOR A TRIFLE AND TOOK IN EXCHANGE NOTHING MORE THAN A MANTLE AND A CAP
SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA
THAT SHE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS HERSELF ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE FOUND THE WHOLE PARTY AT LOO AND WAS IMMEDIATELY INVITED TO JOIN THEM BUT SUSPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYING HIGH SHE DECLINED IT
IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS
SAID MISS BINGLEY WILL SHE BE AS TALL AS I AM I THINK SHE WILL SHE IS NOW ABOUT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET'S HEIGHT OR RATHER TALLER HOW I LONG TO SEE HER AGAIN I NEVER MET
I CANNOT BOAST OF KNOWING MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE THAT ARE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED NOR I I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY THEN
NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING AND THE MODERN LANGUAGES TO DESERVE THE WORD
ARE YOU SO SEVERE UPON YOUR OWN SEX AS TO DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THIS I NEVER SAW SUCH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW SUCH CAPACITY AND TASTE AND APPLICATION AND ELEGANCE AS YOU DESCRIBE UNITED
MISSUS HURST AND MISS BINGLEY BOTH CRIED OUT AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF HER IMPLIED DOUBT AND WERE BOTH PROTESTING THAT THEY KNEW MANY WOMEN WHO ANSWERED THIS DESCRIPTION WHEN MISTER HURST CALLED THEM TO ORDER
RECOMMENDED AN EXPRESS TO TOWN FOR ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS THIS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BROTHER'S PROPOSAL AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING
IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
AND SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FROM THE TWO ELEGANT LADIES WHO WAITED ON HIS SISTERS IN SPITE OF THIS AMENDMENT HOWEVER SHE REQUESTED TO HAVE A NOTE SENT TO LONGBOURN DESIRING HER MOTHER TO VISIT JANE AND FORM HER OWN JUDGEMENT OF HER SITUATION
REMOVED CRIED BINGLEY IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT OF MY SISTER I AM SURE WILL NOT HEAR OF HER REMOVAL YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT MADAM SAID MISS BINGLEY WITH COLD CIVILITY
IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT A DEEP INTRICATE CHARACTER IS MORE OR LESS ESTIMABLE THAN SUCH A ONE AS YOURS LIZZY CRIED HER MOTHER REMEMBER WHERE YOU ARE AND DO NOT RUN ON IN THE WILD MANNER THAT YOU ARE SUFFERED TO DO AT HOME
INDEED MAMMA YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID ELIZABETH BLUSHING FOR HER MOTHER YOU QUITE MISTOOK MISTER DARCY HE ONLY MEANT THAT THERE WAS NOT SUCH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE TO BE MET WITH IN THE COUNTRY AS IN THE TOWN
ELIZABETH FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT TURN HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS NOW ASKED HER IF CHARLOTTE LUCAS HAD BEEN AT LONGBOURN SINCE HER COMING AWAY
BUT HOWEVER HE DID NOT PERHAPS HE THOUGHT HER TOO YOUNG HOWEVER HE WROTE SOME VERSES ON HER AND VERY PRETTY THEY WERE AND SO ENDED HIS AFFECTION SAID ELIZABETH IMPATIENTLY
THERE HAS BEEN MANY A ONE I FANCY OVERCOME IN THE SAME WAY I WONDER WHO FIRST DISCOVERED THE EFFICACY OF POETRY IN DRIVING AWAY LOVE I HAVE BEEN USED TO CONSIDER POETRY AS THE FOOD OF LOVE SAID DARCY
AND ABRUPTLY REMINDED HIM OF HIS PROMISE
HIS ANSWER TO THIS SUDDEN ATTACK WAS DELIGHTFUL TO THEIR MOTHER'S EAR I AM PERFECTLY READY I ASSURE YOU TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT AND WHEN YOUR SISTER IS RECOVERED YOU SHALL IF YOU PLEASE NAME THE VERY DAY OF THE BALL
COULD NOT BE PREVAILED ON TO JOIN IN THEIR CENSURE OF HER IN SPITE OF ALL MISS BINGLEY'S WITTICISMS ON
WALTER SCOTT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE WHARTON FAMILY LAID THEIR HEADS ON THEIR PILLOWS THAT NIGHT WITH A FOREBODING OF SOME INTERRUPTION TO THEIR ORDINARY QUIET UNEASINESS KEPT THE SISTERS FROM ENJOYING THEIR USUAL REPOSE
AND THEY ROSE FROM THEIR BEDS ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING UNREFRESHED AND ALMOST WITHOUT HAVING CLOSED THEIR EYES ON TAKING AN EAGER AND HASTY SURVEY OF THE VALLEY FROM THE WINDOWS OF THEIR ROOM NOTHING HOWEVER BUT ITS USUAL SERENITY WAS TO BE SEEN
AT LENGTH HIS SISTERS WITH TREMBLING HANDS REPLACED HIS ORIGINAL DISGUISE THE INSTRUMENTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY KEPT AT HAND BY CAESAR IN EXPECTATION OF SOME SUDDEN EMERGENCY
NOTHING REMAINED NOW BUT TO MEET THE IMPENDING EXAMINATION WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS THE FAMILY COULD ASSUME THE LEADER OF THE HORSE DISMOUNTED AND FOLLOWED BY A COUPLE OF HIS MEN HE APPROACHED THE OUTER DOOR OF THE BUILDING
AND DROVE THE BLOOD FROM THEIR FACES TO THEIR HEARTS WITH A CHILL THAT NEARLY ANNIHILATED FEELING A MAN WHOSE COLOSSAL STATURE MANIFESTED THE POSSESSION OF VAST STRENGTH ENTERED THE ROOM AND REMOVING HIS CAP
MY BUSINESS WILL BE CONFINED TO A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH IF FREELY ANSWERED WILL INSTANTLY REMOVE US FROM YOUR DWELLING AND WHAT MAY THEY BE SIR STAMMERED MISTER WHARTON
HIS COUNTENANCE GRADUALLY LIGHTING INTO A SMILE OF PLEASURE
AND SUBDUING THE REBEL EARTH INTO SOME SORT OF OBEDIENCE THE GOD SENDS DOWN HIS ANGRY PLAGUES FROM HIGH FAMINE AND PESTILENCE IN HEAPS THEY DIE AGAIN IN VENGEANCE OF HIS WRATH HE FALLS
THEIR DEADLY POWER SHOOK THE FLOURISHING COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH AND DURING WINTER EVEN WE IN OUR NORTHERN RETREAT BEGAN TO QUAKE UNDER THEIR ILL EFFECTS
OCEAN IS THY SLAVE THOU SWEEPEST OVER THE EARTH AND OAKS THE GROWTH OF CENTURIES SUBMIT TO THY VIEWLESS AXE THE SNOW DRIFT IS SCATTERED ON THE PINNACLES OF THE ALPS
THE AVALANCHE THUNDERS DOWN THEIR VALLIES THOU HOLDEST THE KEYS OF THE FROST AND CANST FIRST CHAIN AND THEN SET FREE THE STREAMS UNDER THY GENTLE GOVERNANCE THE BUDS AND LEAVES ARE BORN
OUR VERY CITIES ARE WASTED BY THEE ALAS WHAT WILL BECOME OF US IT SEEMS AS IF THE GIANT WAVES OF OCEAN AND VAST ARMS OF THE SEA WERE ABOUT TO WRENCH THE DEEP ROOTED ISLAND FROM ITS CENTRE AND CAST IT
HAD THE SAME POWERS AS I I
HIS INHERITANCE ON EARTH CUT OFF I REMEMBER AFTER HAVING WITNESSED THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF A FIRE I COULD NOT EVEN BEHOLD A SMALL ONE IN A STOVE WITHOUT A SENSATION OF FEAR
AND NOT FEAR ITS GROWTH AND MATURITY THUS WE BEGAN TO FEEL WITH REGARD TO MANY VISAGED DEATH LET LOOSE ON THE CHOSEN DISTRICTS OF OUR FAIR HABITATION
AND PRONOUNCE IN SUCH A CITY PLAGUE WILL DIE UNPRODUCTIVE IN SUCH ANOTHER NATURE HAS PROVIDED FOR IT A PLENTIFUL HARVEST
IN THE SAME WAY INDIVIDUALS MAY ESCAPE NINETY NINE TIMES AND RECEIVE THE DEATH BLOW AT THE HUNDREDTH BECAUSE BODIES ARE SOMETIMES
GERMANY ITALY AND SPAIN WERE INTERPOSED WALLS YET WITHOUT A BREACH BETWEEN US AND THE PLAGUE OUR VESSELS TRULY WERE THE SPORT OF WINDS AND WAVES EVEN AS GULLIVER
OUR OWN DISTRESSES THOUGH THEY WERE OCCASIONED BY THE FICTITIOUS RECIPROCITY OF COMMERCE ENCREASED IN DUE PROPORTION BANKERS MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS
AND THESE WERE HIS VOWED ENEMIES HE MUST CONCILIATE THEM BY ABANDONING HIS FAVOURITE SCHEME OF EQUALIZATION HE MUST CONFIRM THEM
HE MUST SELL HIS CHERISHED PLANS FOR THE PERMANENT GOOD OF HIS COUNTRY FOR TEMPORARY RELIEF HE MUST AIM NO MORE AT THE DEAR OBJECT OF HIS AMBITION
THE ARRIVAL OF FRESH VESSELS WITH EMIGRANTS THE TOTAL CESSATION OF COMMERCE THE STARVING MULTITUDE THAT THRONGED AROUND THE PALACE OF THE PROTECTORATE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE TAMPERED WITH
ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF THIS MONTH NEWS ARRIVED IN LONDON THAT THE PLAGUE WAS IN FRANCE AND ITALY THESE TIDINGS WERE AT FIRST WHISPERED ABOUT TOWN BUT NO ONE DARED EXPRESS ALOUD THE SOUL QUAILING INTELLIGENCE
ITS OBSCURITY OF SITUATION RENDERED IT THE MORE CONSPICUOUS THE DIMINUTIVE LETTERS GREW GIGANTIC TO THE BEWILDERED EYE OF FEAR THEY SEEMED GRAVEN
THAT BECAME SCARCE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND AN IMMEDIATE REMEDY THE USUAL ONE OF IMPORTS WAS ENTIRELY CUT OFF IN THIS EMERGENCY TO FEED THE VERY PEOPLE TO WHOM WE HAD GIVEN REFUGE WE WERE OBLIGED TO YIELD TO THE PLOUGH
OUR PLEASURE GROUNDS AND PARKS LIVE STOCK DIMINISHED SENSIBLY IN THE COUNTRY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE GREAT DEMAND IN THE MARKET EVEN THE POOR DEER OUR ANTLERED PROTEGES
TO NECESSITOUS FAMILIES MANY OF THESE OF HIGH RANK IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES NOW WITH HOE IN HAND TURNED UP THE SOIL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY AT LAST
THE INFECTION HAD NOW SPREAD IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES OF FRANCE BUT THAT COUNTRY HAD SO MANY RESOURCES IN THE WAY OF AGRICULTURE
CONCOMITANTS WINTER WAS HAILED A GENERAL AND NEVER FAILING PHYSICIAN
VISITATION WE BREATHED AGAIN
YES HE DID INDEED MA'AMSELLE NOTWITHSTANDING ALL I COULD SAY TO THE CONTRARY
AND HE MISTOOK LUDOVICO'S HALL FOR OLD CARLO'S
COME FORTH MY VALOROUS SIGNOR STEWARD JUST THEN OLD CARLO OPENED HIS DOOR AND HE CAME WITH A FLASK IN HIS HAND FOR AS SOON AS THE SIGNOR SAW HIM
INTERRUPTED EMILY QUITE WEARIED BY THIS STORY DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE ANY PRISONERS IN THE CASTLE AND WHETHER THEY ARE CONFINED AT THIS END OF THE EDIFICE
O LORD HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF IT WAS SO WOULD YOU INDEED BE GLAD SAID EMILY IN A TONE OF MOURNFUL REPROACH TO BE SURE I SHOULD
MA'AM REPLIED ANNETTE AND WOULD NOT YOU BE GLAD TOO TO SEE SIGNOR VALANCOURT I DON'T KNOW ANY CHEVALIER I LIKE BETTER I HAVE A VERY GREAT REGARD FOR THE SIGNOR TRULY
ALL THE WORLD COULD NOT PERSUADE ME OUT OF THEM ROBERTO AND SEBASTIAN AND HALF A DOZEN MORE OF THEM WENT INTO FITS TO BE SURE THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THAT I SAID MYSELF THERE WAS NO NEED OF THAT
NAY MA'AMSELLE YOU WILL BELIEVE NOTHING YOU ARE ALMOST AS BAD AS THE SIGNOR HIMSELF WHO WAS IN A GREAT PASSION WHEN THEY TOLD OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SWORE THAT THE FIRST MAN WHO REPEATED SUCH NONSENSE SHOULD BE THROWN INTO THE DUNGEON UNDER THE EAST TURRET THIS WAS A HARD
WERE THE SAME OR IF THEY WERE WHETHER THIS WAS VALANCOURT SHE HOWEVER DESIRED THAT ANNETTE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO LEARN WHETHER ANY PRISONERS WERE IN THE CASTLE AND ALSO THEIR NAMES O DEAR MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I FORGET TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU BADE ME ASK ABOUT
AND SAYING WHAT A FINE THING IT WAS FOR HIS EXCELLENZA TO CATCH UP MEN AND THEY WERE AS GOOD BOOTY AS ANY OTHER BECAUSE OF THE RANSOMS
I WILL HAVE NO MORE ARGUMENT SAID MONTONI WITH A LOOK THAT MADE HER TREMBLE WHAT HAD I BUT TROUBLE TO EXPECT WHEN I CONDESCENDED TO REASON WITH A BABY BUT I WILL BE TRIFLED WITH NO LONGER
LET THE RECOLLECTION OF YOUR AUNT'S SUFFERINGS IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER FOLLY AND OBSTINACY TEACH YOU A LESSON SIGN THE PAPERS EMILY'S RESOLUTION WAS FOR A MOMENT AWED SHE SHRUNK AT THE RECOLLECTIONS HE REVIVED
FROM HER INFANCY REGARDED AN ACT OF INJUSTICE INSPIRED HER WITH A NOBLE THOUGH IMPRUDENT COURAGE SIGN THE PAPERS SAID MONTONI MORE IMPATIENTLY THAN BEFORE NEVER SIR
NIGHT REPEATED ANOTHER VOICE MONTONI PAUSED AND TURNED HALF ROUND BUT SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF HE PROCEEDED IN A LOWER TONE YOU HAVE LATELY SEEN ONE TERRIBLE EXAMPLE OF OBSTINACY AND FOLLY
YET THIS IT APPEARS HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO DETER YOU
FOR THOUGH YOUR REPENTANCE WOULD PUT AN IMMEDIATE END TO OPPOSITION IT WOULD NOT NOW APPEASE MY INDIGNATION I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE AS WELL AS JUSTICE ANOTHER GROAN FILLED THE PAUSE WHICH MONTONI MADE
QUIT MY PRESENCE CRIED MONTONI THIS AFFECTATION OF FEAR ILL BECOMES THE HEROINE WHO HAS JUST DARED TO BRAVE MY INDIGNATION DID YOU HEAR NOTHING SIGNOR SAID EMILY TREMBLING AND STILL UNABLE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
OBEY MY ORDER REPEATED MONTONI AND FOR THESE FOOL'S TRICKS I WILL SOON DISCOVER BY WHOM THEY ARE PRACTISED EMILY AGAIN ROSE AND EXERTED HERSELF TO THE UTMOST TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHILE MONTONI FOLLOWED HER
OR THAT HENRY E DIXIE A WELL KNOWN PERFORMER OF THE DAY WAS THEN ONLY A FEW TABLES OFF AT RECTOR'S HE COULD ALWAYS OBTAIN THIS SATISFACTION FOR THERE ONE COULD ENCOUNTER POLITICIANS BROKERS ACTORS
PARTICULARLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAD NOT YET REACHED BUT HOPED TO DO SO THE DAZZLING HEIGHT WHICH MONEY TO DINE HERE LAVISHLY REPRESENTED YOU DON'T SAY SO WOULD BE THE REPLY WHY
THE LONG BAR WAS A BLAZE OF LIGHTS POLISHED WOOD WORK COLOURED AND CUT GLASSWARE AND MANY FANCY BOTTLES
WITH RICH SCREENS FANCY WINES AND A LINE OF BAR GOODS UNSURPASSED IN THE COUNTRY AT RECTOR'S DROUET HAD MET MISTER G W HURSTWOOD MANAGER OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S
AND CAPABLE OF CREATING A GOOD IMPRESSION HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION WAS FAIRLY IMPORTANT A KIND OF STEWARDSHIP WHICH WAS IMPOSING BUT LACKED FINANCIAL CONTROL HE HAD RISEN BY PERSEVERANCE AND INDUSTRY
AND UPON A CASHIER WHO LOOKED AFTER THE MONEY TAKEN IN FOR THE MOST PART HE LOUNGED ABOUT DRESSED IN EXCELLENT TAILORED SUITS OF IMPORTED GOODS A SOLITAIRE RING A FINE BLUE DIAMOND IN HIS TIE A STRIKING VEST OF SOME NEW PATTERN
THESE WERE THE KIND OF MEN WITH WHOM HE WOULD CONVERSE LONGEST AND MOST SERIOUSLY
AND REPORT THE STATE OF TRADE IN THE CITIES WHICH HE VISITED AND SO MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF ALMOST INVARIABLY AGREEABLE TO NIGHT HE WAS PARTICULARLY SO SINCE HIS REPORT TO THE COMPANY HAD BEEN FAVOURABLY COMMENTED UPON
LEANED TOWARD THEM FROM BEHIND THE BAR OLD PEPPER SAID DROUET A LITTLE OF THE SAME FOR ME PUT IN HURSTWOOD HOW LONG ARE YOU IN TOWN THIS TIME INQUIRED HURSTWOOD ONLY UNTIL WEDNESDAY I'M GOING UP TO SAINT PAUL
NO HE CAN'T INJURE THAT ANY I GUESS HURSTWOOD WAS STANDING HIS COAT OPEN HIS THUMBS IN HIS POCKETS THE LIGHT ON HIS JEWELS AND RINGS RELIEVING THEM WITH AGREEABLE DISTINCTNESS HE WAS THE PICTURE OF FASTIDIOUS COMFORT
THE MANY FRIENDS HE MET HERE DROPPED IN BECAUSE THEY CRAVED
RETURNED HURSTWOOD HE'S GOT THE MONEY ALL RIGHT AND A LITTLE TWINKLE PASSED OVER HIS EYES I DON'T GO MUCH ON THOSE THINGS DO YOU
SOME BOUND FOR THE THEATRES SOME TO THEIR CLUBS AND SOME TO THAT MOST FASCINATING OF ALL THE PLEASURES FOR THE TYPE OF MAN THERE REPRESENTED AT LEAST THE LADIES YES I WILL SAID DROUET
SAY SHE WAS A LITTLE DANDY I TELL YOU
FRESH CANS OF ALE WERE BROUGHT AND WITH JEST AND SONG AND MERRY TALES THE HOURS SLIPPED AWAY ON FLEETING WINGS NONE THOUGHT OF TIME OR TIDE TILL THE NIGHT WAS SO FAR GONE THAT LITTLE JOHN PUT BY THE THOUGHT OF SETTING FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND SO
ACROSS THE TANNER'S SHOULDERS WAS SLUNG HIS STOUT QUARTERSTAFF EVER NEAR ENOUGH TO HIM TO BE GRIPPED QUICKLY AND ON HIS HEAD WAS A CAP OF DOUBLED COWHIDE SO TOUGH THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE CLOVEN EVEN BY A BROADSWORD NOW QUOTH ARTHUR A BLAND TO HIMSELF
LITTLE JOHN TROD UPON A STICK WHICH SNAPPED UNDER HIS FOOT WHEREUPON HEARING THE NOISE THE TANNER TURNED QUICKLY AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE YEOMAN SEEING THAT THE TANNER HAD SPIED HIM OUT LITTLE JOHN PUT A BOLD FACE UPON THE MATTER
FOR I WILL GIVE THEE SUCH A DRUBBING AS NE'ER HAST THOU HAD IN ALL THY LIFE BEFORE TAKE THY STAFF IN THY HAND FELLOW FOR I WILL NOT SMITE AN UNARMED MAN
AT THIS ROBIN HOOD STOPPED AND LISTENED SURELY QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF THAT IS LITTLE JOHN'S VOICE AND HE IS TALKING IN ANGER ALSO METHINKS THE OTHER IS STRANGE TO MY EARS
THIS POOR FELLOW WHOM THOU HAST SO BELABORED IS COUNTED THE BEST HAND AT THE QUARTERSTAFF IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND HIS NAME IS LITTLE JOHN AND MINE ROBIN HOOD
NAY QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TESTILY AT THE SAME TIME RISING CAREFULLY AS THOUGH HIS BONES HAD BEEN MADE OF GLASS I CAN HELP MYSELF GOOD FELLOW WITHOUT THY AID AND LET ME TELL THEE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT VILE COWSKIN CAP OF THINE
BUT ON THE CURATE ADDRESSING SOME FURTHER WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT TO HER SIGHING DEEPLY SHE BROKE SILENCE AND SAID SINCE THE SOLITUDE OF THESE MOUNTAINS HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL ME AND THE ESCAPE OF MY DISHEVELLED TRESSES WILL NOT ALLOW MY TONGUE TO DEAL IN FALSEHOODS
IT WOULD BE IDLE FOR ME NOW TO MAKE ANY FURTHER PRETENCE OF WHAT IF YOU WERE TO BELIEVE ME YOU WOULD BELIEVE MORE OUT OF COURTESY THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON
THIS BEING SO I SAY I THANK YOU SIRS FOR THE OFFER YOU HAVE MADE ME WHICH PLACES ME UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST YOU HAVE MADE OF ME THOUGH I FEAR THE ACCOUNT I SHALL GIVE YOU OF MY MISFORTUNES WILL EXCITE IN YOU AS MUCH CONCERN AS COMPASSION
I FEEL BOUND TO TELL WHAT I WOULD WILLINGLY KEEP SECRET IF I COULD ALL THIS SHE WHO WAS NOW SEEN TO BE A LOVELY WOMAN DELIVERED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION WITH SO MUCH EASE AND IN SO SWEET A VOICE THAT THEY WERE NOT LESS CHARMED BY HER INTELLIGENCE THAN BY HER BEAUTY
AND AS THE SAYING IS OLD RUSTY CHRISTIANS BUT SO RICH THAT BY THEIR WEALTH AND FREE HANDED WAY OF LIFE THEY ARE COMING BY DEGREES TO BE CONSIDERED GENTLEFOLK BY BIRTH AND EVEN BY POSITION
AS WELL AS THE REPEATED ADVICE OF MY PARENTS WHO NOW VERY PLAINLY PERCEIVED DON FERNANDO'S PURPOSE FOR HE CARED VERY LITTLE IF ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT THEY TOLD ME THEY TRUSTED AND CONFIDED THEIR HONOUR AND GOOD NAME TO MY VIRTUE
I HAVE HEARD OF ANOTHER OF THE SAME NAME WHO CAN PERHAPS MATCH YOUR MISFORTUNES BUT PROCEED BY AND BY I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU AS MUCH AS IT WILL EXCITE YOUR COMPASSION DOROTHEA WAS STRUCK BY CARDENIO'S WORDS AS WELL AS BY HIS STRANGE AND MISERABLE ATTIRE
THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
I REMEMBER TOO HOW MY MAID HEARD THOSE WORDS IN REPROOF OF HER AUDACITY THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE AND HOW I WAS FORCED TO PUT A CONSTRAINT ON MY TEARS AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF MY COUNTENANCE NOT TO GIVE MY PARENTS CAUSE TO ASK ME WHY I WAS SO MELANCHOLY
IT WAS SAID TOO THAT HER NAME WAS LUSCINDA AND THAT AT THE BETROTHAL SOME STRANGE THINGS HAD HAPPENED
AND THAT ON THE BRIDEGROOM APPROACHING TO UNLACE THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS TO GIVE HER AIR
ALL THIS WAS A MATTER OF NOTORIETY IN THE CITY AND EVERYONE SPOKE OF IT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT LUSCINDA WAS MISSING FROM HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND FROM THE CITY FOR SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE TO THE DISTRACTION OF HER PARENTS WHO KNEW NOT WHAT STEPS TO TAKE TO RECOVER HER WHAT I LEARNED
INDULGING IN FAINT AND DISTANT HOPES OF CHERISHING THAT LIFE THAT I NOW ABHOR BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE CITY UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO AS I COULD NOT FIND DON FERNANDO I HEARD NOTICE GIVEN BY THE PUBLIC CRIER OFFERING A GREAT REWARD TO ANYONE WHO SHOULD FIND ME
FOR THE SUN WAS HOT AND THEY WERE TIRED OF WALKING FERKO FELL FAST ASLEEP BUT THE OTHER TWO REMAINED AWAKE AND THE ELDEST SAID TO THE SECOND BROTHER WHAT DO YOU SAY TO DOING OUR BROTHER FERKO SOME HARM
HE IS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT EVERYONE TAKES A FANCY TO HIM WHICH IS MORE THAN THEY DO TO US IF WE COULD ONLY GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY WE MIGHT SUCCEED BETTER I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU ANSWERED THE SECOND BROTHER
THERE IS A LAKE DOWN THERE BELOW US AND ANYONE WHO BATHES IN IT THOUGH HE WERE AT DEATH'S DOOR BECOMES SOUND AND WELL ON THE SPOT AND THOSE WHO WASH THEIR EYES WITH THE DEW ON THIS HILL
THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THEY WERE BUT MY WING HAS BEEN VERY FEEBLE AND WEAK EVER SINCE IT WAS SHOT BY AN ARROW MANY YEARS AGO SO LET US FLY AT ONCE TO THE LAKE THAT I MAY BE RESTORED TO HEALTH AND STRENGTH AGAIN
THE GRATEFUL CREATURE THANKED HIS BENEFACTOR WARMLY AND PROMISED FERKO TO DO HIM A GOOD TURN IF HE SHOULD EVER NEED IT FERKO CONTINUED HIS WAY TILL HE CAME TO A PLOUGHED FIELD
HERE HE NOTICED A LITTLE MOUSE CREEPING WEARILY ALONG ON ITS HIND PAWS FOR ITS FRONT PAWS HAD BOTH BEEN BROKEN IN A TRAP FERKO FELT SO SORRY FOR THE LITTLE BEAST
FOR SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE SO HANDSOME IN HER LIFE BEFORE HIS BROTHERS NOTICED THIS AND ENVY AND JEALOUSY WERE ADDED TO THEIR FEAR SO MUCH SO THAT THEY DETERMINED ONCE MORE TO DESTROY HIM
AS HE WAS WANDERING DISCONSOLATELY ABOUT THE MEADOWS ROUND THE PALACE WONDERING HOW HE COULD ESCAPE BEING PUT TO DEATH A LITTLE BEE FLEW PAST AND SETTLING ON HIS SHOULDER WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
ON THE DELIGHTED FERKO BUT THE TWO BROTHERS HAD GROWN QUITE GREEN WITH ENVY AND ONLY DECLARED THE MORE THAT FERKO WAS NOTHING BUT A WICKED MAGICIAN
THE KING ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED AT THE WAY HIS COMMANDS HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT WAS VERY VEXED
LET US MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE AND IF HE FAILS HE SHALL DIE THEN THE ELDEST BROTHER REPLIED THE CORN HAS ALL BEEN CUT BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUT INTO BARNS
THAT NEEDN'T DISTRESS YOU MUCH JUST TRUST IN ME AND BEFORE THE SUN SETS AGAIN YOU SHALL HEAR THAT YOUR TASK IS DONE AND WITH THESE WORDS THE LITTLE CREATURE SCAMPERED AWAY INTO THE FIELDS
AND THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER
BUT NOW WHAT THIRD TASK SHALL WE SET HIM TO DO NO MATTER HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS HE MUST DO IT OR DIE THE ELDEST ANSWERED QUICKLY LET HIM DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THIS HILL
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT ALL ALONE BY YOURSELF IF I CAN HELP YOU IN ANY WAY ONLY SAY THE WORD FOR I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PROOF OF MY GRATITUDE FERKO AT ONCE RECOGNISED THE WOLF
AND THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN IF HE LEFT THE COUNTRY HE LAY DOWN ONCE MORE ON THE GRASS AND SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP ALL THE NEXT DAY HE SPENT WANDERING ABOUT THE FIELDS
FOR SHE WAS SHUT UP IN HER TOWER WEEPING BITTERLY THE WICKED BROTHERS STAMPED AND FOAMED WITH RAGE WHEN THEY SAW THE FAILURE OF THEIR WICKED DESIGNS BUT THE KING WAS OVERCOME BY A SUDDEN TERROR
KLETKE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE THREE PRINCESSES WHO WERE ALL THREE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL BUT THE YOUNGEST ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT FAIRER THAN THE OTHER TWO WAS THE MOST LOVEABLE OF THEM ALL
INSISTED ALWAYS ON KEEPING WATCH ALONE SO SHE LIVED IN SOLITUDE ALL THE DAYTIME AND AT NIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED HAD SHE NOT BEEN SO BRAVE BUT EVERY DAY
AND KISSED THE LITTLE WEARY WHITE HANDS I AM THE PRINCE HE SAID WHO YOU IN YOUR GOODNESS WHEN I WAS WANDERING ABOUT IN THE SHAPE OF A BLACK CROW FREED FROM THE MOST AWFUL TORMENTS
AH THESE MUSKETEERS OF YOURS ARE VERY DEVILS FELLOWS TO BE HANGED NO SIRE REPLIED TREVILLE WHO SAW AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOW THINGS WOULD GO ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE GOOD CREATURES AS MEEK AS LAMBS AND HAVE BUT ONE DESIRE
I'LL BE THEIR WARRANTY AND THAT IS THAT THEIR SWORDS MAY NEVER LEAVE THEIR SCABBARDS BUT IN YOUR MAJESTY'S SERVICE BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO DO
AND BY AND BY BY AND BY WE WILL SEE AH SIRE IT IS BECAUSE I CONFIDE IN THAT JUSTICE THAT I SHALL WAIT PATIENTLY AND QUIETLY THE GOOD PLEASURE OF YOUR MAJESTY
BUT I LEAVE YOUR MAJESTY TO JUDGE WHAT FIVE ARMED MEN COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING TO DO IN SUCH A DESERTED PLACE AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD
HE IS THE SON OF ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS THE SON OF A MAN WHO SERVED UNDER THE KING YOUR FATHER OF GLORIOUS MEMORY IN THE CIVIL WAR AND YOU SAY THIS YOUNG MAN BEHAVED HIMSELF WELL TELL ME HOW TREVILLE YOU KNOW HOW I DELIGHT IN ACCOUNTS OF WAR AND FIGHTING
HE WHO WOUNDED JUSSAC CRIED THE KING HE A BOY
IT IS AS I HAVE THE HONOR TO RELATE IT TO YOUR MAJESTY JUSSAC ONE OF THE FIRST SWORDSMEN IN THE KINGDOM WELL SIRE FOR ONCE HE FOUND HIS MASTER I WILL SEE THIS YOUNG MAN TREVILLE I WILL SEE HIM AND IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE
WHO HASTENED TO THE SUCCOR OF THEIR COMRADES THE MELEE BECAME GENERAL BUT STRENGTH WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE MUSKETEERS
GENTLEMEN I WILL SEE THE KING THIS EVENING BUT AS TO YOU I DO NOT ADVISE YOU TO RISK DOING SO THIS ADVICE WAS TOO REASONABLE AND MOREOVER CAME FROM A MAN WHO KNEW THE KING TOO WELL TO ALLOW THE FOUR YOUNG MEN TO DISPUTE IT
NOT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL I AM ABOUT TO MAKE TO YOU
THEN AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A MORE REASONABLE PROPOSAL HE AGREED TO IT BOTH DESCENDED TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE WOUNDED MAN LAY THE LATTER ON SEEING THESE TWO NOBLE LORDS WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM ENDEAVORED TO RAISE HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED
THAT HIS EMINENCE'S GUARDSMEN HAD RECEIVED
WHEN HE WAS LEFT STIFF AS A RUSH IN LONDON IN THE INTERVENING TIME BUCKINGHAM PERHAPS SENT HIM TO PARIS AS HE DID THE HORSES HAS ANYONE BROUGHT A LETTER FOR ME ASKED D'ARTAGNAN EAGERLY

WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOUR THREE COMPANIONS
HOAR IN THE MOONBEAMS STOOD THOSE GRACEFUL TREES CASTING THEIR MOVELESS SHADOWS UPON THE GRASS AND IN THE BACKGROUND CROWNING THE UNDULATIONS OF THE DISTANCE IN MASSES WERE PILED THOSE WOODS AMONG WHICH LAY THE SOLITARY TOMB
AND GOOD MISTER CLAY READY AT CALL IN THE VILLAGE MUCH GOOD THAT LITTLE BLACK WHIPPER SNAPPER WILL DO HIM WITH THAT LITTLE BLACK MAN ON THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL I WAS SENT OUT FOR SOME REASON FOR A WALK MY GOVERNESS WAS ILL I KNOW

WELL YOU CAN'T BUT I CAN SEE BEYOND IT SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT I SEE EVER SO MUCH I SEE A COTTAGE WITH A STEEP ROOF THAT LOOKS LIKE GOLD IN THE SUNLIGHT
WE CANNOT WALK TO THE PLACE I HAVE DESCRIBED WE CAN ONLY REACH IT THROUGH THE GATE OF DEATH TO WHICH WE ARE ALL TENDING YOUNG AND OLD WITH SURE STEPS AND WHERE IS THE GATE OF DEATH I ASKED IN A SORT OF WHISPER AS WE WALKED TOGETHER
AND I SUPPOSE THESE EARLIER ASSOCIATIONS GAVE TO MY REVERIE ABOUT MY FATHER'S COMING VISITOR
WITH HER EAR AT THE KEYHOLE OF PAPA'S STUDY
HER EYES WERE TURNED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STAIRS FROM WHICH ONLY SHE APPREHENDED SURPRISE HER GREAT MOUTH WAS OPEN AND HER EYES ABSOLUTELY GOGGLED WITH EAGERNESS SHE WAS DEVOURING ALL THAT WAS PASSING THERE
MADAME HAD COMMISSIONED HER TO BUY IT IN THE TOWN AND CONVEY IT TO HER BED ROOM UPON THIS MISSUS RUSK IMPOUNDED THE FLASK AND WITH ANNE BESIDE HER RATHER PRECIPITATELY APPEARED BEFORE THE MASTER HE HEARD AND SUMMONED MADAME
THE AIR WAS SWEET THE LANDSCAPE CHARMING I SO GOOD EVERYTHING SO BEAUTIFUL WHERE SHOULD WE GO THIS WAY I HAD MADE A RESOLUTION TO SPEAK AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE TO MADAME I WAS SO INCENSED AT THE TREACHERY I HAD WITNESSED
BUT SUCH RESOLUTIONS DO NOT LAST LONG WITH VERY YOUNG PEOPLE AND BY THE TIME WE HAD REACHED THE SKIRTS OF THE WOOD WE WERE TALKING PRETTY MUCH AS USUAL I DON'T WISH TO GO INTO THE WOOD MADAME AND FOR WHAT POOR MAMMA IS BURIED THERE

BUT YOU ARE NOT SUCH FOOL AS YOU FEIGN YOURSELF NO NO YOU KNOW EVERYTHING COME TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT IS FOR YOUR ADVANTAGE YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN HIS WILL AND WHEN HE WROTE BUT MADAME I REALLY KNOW NOTHING OF IT
HE HAS NEVER SPOKEN OF IT TO ME I KNOW HE LOVES ME THAT IS ENOUGH
TO RECOLLECT ANY EVIDENCE OF A SIMILAR CONTEMPTUOUS ESTIMATE ON THE PART OF THAT BEAUTIFUL AND GARRULOUS DANDY I COULD NOT QUITE THE REVERSE INDEED STILL I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND FEVERISH
LOOKING DOWN FROM THE CORNERS OF HER EYES IN AN INTERESTING DEJECTION
VOUS SAVEZ LES MALADES SEE NEVER VISITORS SHE REPLIED WITH A STARTLED SORT OF TARTNESS AND A MOMENTARY ENERGY BESIDES I CANNOT CONVERSE
OF HEAD AND OF THE EAR THE RIGHT EAR IT IS PARFOIS AGONY ABSOLUTELY AND NOW IT IS HERE AND SHE WINCED AND MOANED WITH HER EYES CLOSED AND HER HAND PRESSED TO THE ORGAN AFFECTED
SIMPLE AS I WAS I FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT MADAME WAS SHAMMING SHE WAS OVER ACTING HER TRANSITIONS WERE TOO VIOLENT AND BESIDE SHE FORGOT THAT I KNEW HOW WELL SHE COULD SPEAK ENGLISH AND MUST PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS HEIGHTENING THE INTEREST OF HER HELPLESSNESS
I RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM
THE RUSSIAN MERCHANT LEFT HER EVERYTHING SHE HAS NOT A HUMAN RELATION AND SHE IS IN THE BEST SET YOU WERE ALWAYS A MATCH MAKER MONICA SAID MY FATHER STOPPING AND PUTTING HIS HAND KINDLY ON HERS
YOU KNOW MY DEAR YOUR FATHER IS AN ODDITY SHE SAID I DON'T MIND HIM I NEVER DID YOU MUST NOT CRACKY MY DEAR CRACKY DECIDEDLY CRACKY AND SHE TAPPED THE CORNER OF HER FOREHEAD WITH A LOOK SO SLY AND COMICAL
YOU FEEL VERY SLEEPY AS HE DID THIS SEVERAL OF THE VOLUNTEERS CLOSED THEIR EYES AT ONCE AND ONE FELL ASLEEP IMMEDIATELY ONE OR TWO REMAINED AWAKE
AND WITH THIS SENSATION HE REGAINED SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THIS IS TO BE DOUBTED AS A RULE SUBJECTS IN THIS STAGE OF HYPNOTISM DO NOT FEEL ANY SENSATION THAT THEY CAN REMEMBER
THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN AND TWIRLED THEM FASTER AND FASTER IN SPITE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO STOP ONE OF THE SUBJECTS SAID HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE STRANGE ACTION OF HIS HANDS AND SOMETIMES IT PUZZLED HIM TO KNOW WHY THEY WHIRLED
PRESENTLY THE SUBJECT'S HEAD LEANED FORWARD THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES DILATED AND ASSUMED A PECULIAR GLASSY STARE HE AROSE WITH A STEADY GLIDING GAIT
BUT THE MOMENT THE GESTURE WAS MADE HIS COUNTENANCE FELL HIS MIRTH STOPPED WHILE THAT OF HIS COMPANIONS REDOUBLED AND THE CHANGE WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT THE AUDIENCE SHARED IN THE LAUGHTER BUT THE SUBJECT NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD
THE BARE SUGGESTION WAS GIVEN AS NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE A NEWSBOY AND ARE SELLING PAPERS OR NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE HUNTING AND ARE GOING INTO THE WOODS TO SHOOT BIRDS SO THE PARTY WAS STARTED
ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER AS THE SAYING IS AND ALL THE WORLD LOVES TO LAUGH AT HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WAS TOLD THAT THE HEAD OF A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WAS ON FIRE
HE POINTED TO A SUPPOSITIOUS CANVAS PICTURE HE CHAFFED THE BOYS HE FLATTERED THE VANITY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS WITH THEIR GIRLS TELLING THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT AFFORD FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS TO MISS THIS GREAT SHOW
THE SENSATIONS PRODUCED DURING A STATE OF HYPNOSIS ARE VERY INTERESTING AS MAY BE SUPPOSED THEY DIFFER GREATLY IN DIFFERENT PERSONS
ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING ACCOUNTS EVER GIVEN IS THAT OF DOCTOR JAMES R COCKE A HYPNOTIST HIMSELF WHO SUBMITTED TO BEING OPERATED UPON BY A PROFESSIONAL MAGNETIZER
HE THEN MADE PASSES OVER MY HEAD DOWN OVER MY HANDS AND BODY BUT DID NOT TOUCH ME HE THEN SAID TO ME YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES THE MOTOR APPARATUS OF MY LIDS WOULD NOT SEEMINGLY RESPOND TO MY WILL
THE OPERATOR WENT ON PRICKING THE ARM WITH A PIN AND THOUGH DOCTOR COCKE FELT THE PAIN HE SAID HE DID NOT FEEL IT AND AT THE SAME TIME THE SENSATION OF TERROR INCREASED I WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF MY BODY AT ALL HE SAYS FURTHER ON
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE HYPNOTIST COMMANDED ME TO AWAKE AS SOON AS I DROPPED MY ARM AND YET TEN MINUTES OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS HAD PASSED ON A SUBSEQUENT OCCASION DOCTOR COCKE WHO WAS BLIND WAS PUT INTO A DEEP HYPNOTIC SLEEP
BY FIXING HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND THIS TIME HE EXPERIENCED A STILL GREATER DEGREE OF TERROR AND INCIDENTALLY LEARNED THAT HE COULD HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF THE MATTER OF SELF HYPNOTISM
WE SHALL CONSIDER IN ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THIS CONNECTION WE FIND GREAT INTEREST IN AN ARTICLE IN THE MEDICAL NEWS JULY TWENTY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
HE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN A CONDITION OF SELF INDUCED HYPNOTISM IN WHICH THEIR SUBJECTIVE FACULTIES WERE SO EXALTED AS TO SUPERSEDE THEIR OBJECTIVE PERCEPTIONS MUSIC WAS NO LONGER TO THEM A SUCCESSION OF PLEASING SOUNDS
THE EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED ON OTHER SUBJECTS IN ALL CASES WITH THE SAME RESULT
TO HIM IT ALWAYS EXPRESSED THE PICTURED WILD RIDE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF WOTAN THE SUBJECT TAKING PART IN THE RIDE IT WAS NOTICEABLE IN EACH CASE THAT THE SAME MUSIC PLAYED TO THEM IN THE WAKING STATE PRODUCED NO SPECIAL IMPRESSION
AND THE SUBJECT SEEMED TO CONTEMPLATE A LANDSCAPE OF LOFTY GRANDEUR A DIFFERENT SORT OF MUSIC WAS PLAYED
PROBABLY NO SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON WAS EVER SO GROSSLY PROSTITUTED TO BASE ENDS AS THAT OF HYPNOTISM LATER WE SHALL SEE SOME OF THE OUTRAGEOUS FORMS THIS CHARLATANISM ASSUMES
AND HOW IT EXTENDS TO THE PROFESSIONAL SUBJECTS AS WELL AS TO THE PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS TILL THOSE SUBJECTS EVEN IMPOSE UPON SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO OUGHT TO BE PROOF AGAINST SUCH DECEPTION
SECONDLY I WISHED TO BE HYPNOTIZED THESE TOGETHER WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION AND STRAINED ATTENTION BROUGHT ON THE STATES WHICH OCCURRED
ALL OF WHICH WERE PRESUMABLY DUE TO OPIUM THE CAUSES WHICH DOCTOR COCKE THINKS PRODUCED THE HYPNOTIC CONDITION IN HIS CASE NAMELY BELIEF DESIRE TO BE HYPNOTIZED AND STRAINED ATTENTION UNITED WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION
AND POSSIBLY THESE TWO THINGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE MUCH THE SAME IN FACT ON NO OTHER GROUND CAN WE EXPLAIN THE SO CALLED CHILDREN'S CRUSADE IN WHICH OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM GERMANY FROM ALL CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY
I CAN HYPNOTIZE MYSELF TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT I WILL BECOME WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS OF EVENTS TAKING PLACE AROUND ME AND A LONG INTERVAL OF TIME SAY FROM ONE HALF TO TWO HOURS WILL BE A COMPLETE BLANK
AND SOME OF THEM FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF LORD GEORGE SINGLED HIM OUT FOR FRIENDLY NOTICE GIVING HIM A NOD OR A WORD IN PASSING EVERY SEASON HAS ITS PLEASURES FOR BOYS AND THE CONSTANT CHANGE THAT THEY BRING IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DELIGHTS OF BOYHOOD'S DAYS
WHICH WHEN THE EAST WIND WAS STRAINING FLEW LOW OVERHEAD TO PITCH TO THE LAKE IN THE FORBIDDEN PRECINCTS OF THE DEER PARK BEYOND THE BROW OF THE HILL
AROUND WHICH THE FOLKS GATHERED SHELTERING THEIR FACES AS BEST THEY COULD FROM THE SCORCHING HEAT AND CLOAKING THEIR SHOULDERS FROM THE BITING COLD FOR AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM WHERE GIANT SHADOWS SWAYED AND BOWED AND DANCED HUGE AND BLACK AGAINST THE HIGH WALLS
BUT AT THE BEST ONLY RUDE STORIES AND JESTS RECITED BY SOME STROLLING MUMMER OR MINSTREL TO THE LISTENING CIRCLE GATHERED AROUND THE BLAZE AND WELCOMING THE COARSE GROSS JESTS AND COARSER GROSSER SONGS WITH ROARS OF BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER
YET BLEAK AND DREARY AS WAS THE WINTER IN THOSE DAYS AND COLD AND BITING AS WAS THE FROST IN THE CHEERLESS WINDY HALLS AND CORRIDORS OF THE CASTLE IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS JOYS TO THE YOUNG LADS FOR THEN AS NOW BOYS COULD FIND PLEASURE EVEN IN SLUSHY WEATHER
WHOLE BARRELS OF ALE AND MALMSEY WERE BROACHED AND ALL THE FOLK GENTLE AND SIMPLE WERE BIDDEN TO THE FEAST AFTERWARDS THE MINSTRELS DANCED AND PLAYED A RUDE PLAY AND IN THE EVENING A MIRACLE SHOW WAS PERFORMED ON A RAISED PLATFORM IN THE NORTH HALL
FOR A WEEK AFTERWARDS THE CASTLE WAS FED UPON THE REMAINS OF THE GOOD THINGS LEFT FROM THAT GREAT FEAST UNTIL EVERYONE GREW TO LOATHE FINE VICTUALS AND LONGED FOR HONEST BEEF AND MUSTARD AGAIN THEN AT LAST IN THAT CONSTANT CHANGE THE WINTER WAS GONE
AND EVEN THE LADS WHO HAD ENJOYED ITS PASSING WERE GLAD WHEN THE WINDS BLEW WARM ONCE MORE AND THE GRASS SHOWED GREEN IN SUNNY PLACES AND THE LEADER OF THE WILD FOWL BLEW HIS HORN AS THEY WHO IN THE FALL HAD FLOWN TO THE SOUTH FLEW ARROW LIKE NORTHWARD AGAIN
THERE BE NO MORE PLAY FOR US UNTIL WE GET ANOTHER BALL THE OUTFIELDERS CAME SLOWLY TROOPING IN UNTIL THEY HAD GATHERED IN A LITTLE CIRCLE AROUND MYLES I COULD NOT HELP IT SAID MYLES IN ANSWER TO THEIR GRUMBLING HOW KNEW I THE BALL WOULD FLY SO FAR
AND WAS KEPT ABSOLUTELY PRIVATE FOR THE USE OF THE COUNTESS AND HER FAMILY ONLY A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE MYLES HAD FIRST COME TO DEVLEN ONE OF THE COOK'S MEN HAD BEEN FOUND CLIMBING THE WALL WHEREUPON THE SOLDIER WHO SAW HIM SHOT HIM WITH HIS CROSS BOW
THE STATEMENT THAT HIS OLD FRIEND HAD BECOME A LORD AND WAS IN DANGER OF BEING AN EARL IF HE LIVED LONG ENOUGH CAUSED DICK TO SO OPEN HIS EYES AND MOUTH AND START THAT HIS CAP FELL OFF WHEN HE PICKED IT UP HE UTTERED A RATHER SINGULAR EXCLAMATION
MISTER HOBBS THOUGHT I'D HAD A SUNSTROKE I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO LIKE IT MYSELF BUT I LIKE IT BETTER NOW I'M USED TO IT THE ONE WHO IS THE EARL NOW HE'S MY GRANDPAPA AND HE WANTS ME TO DO ANYTHING I LIKE
WELL GOOD BYE HE SAID AND THOUGH HE TRIED TO SPEAK STEADILY THERE WAS A LITTLE TREMBLE IN HIS VOICE AND HE WINKED HIS BIG BROWN EYES AND I HOPE TRADE'LL BE GOOD I'M SORRY I'M GOING AWAY TO LEAVE YOU
HE LAID THE CASE ON HIS STOUT KNEE AND BLEW HIS NOSE VIOLENTLY SEVERAL TIMES THERE'S SOMETHING WRITTEN ON IT SAID CEDRIC INSIDE THE CASE I TOLD THE MAN MYSELF WHAT TO SAY
I SHA'N'T FORGET YOU HE SAID SPEAKING A TRIFLE HUSKILY AS DICK HAD SPOKEN NOR DON'T YOU GO AND FORGET ME WHEN YOU GET AMONG THE BRITISH ARRYSTOCRACY
IT SEEMED ALMOST DIRECTLY THEY WERE ON THE STEAMER IN THE MIDST OF THE WILDEST BUSTLE AND CONFUSION CARRIAGES WERE DRIVING DOWN AND LEAVING PASSENGERS PASSENGERS WERE GETTING INTO A STATE OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT BAGGAGE WHICH HAD NOT ARRIVED AND THREATENED TO BE TOO LATE
BIG TRUNKS AND CASES WERE BEING BUMPED DOWN AND DRAGGED ABOUT SAILORS WERE UNCOILING ROPES AND HURRYING TO AND FRO OFFICERS WERE GIVING ORDERS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND CHILDREN AND NURSES WERE COMING ON BOARD
IT'S A HANKERCHER HE POURED IT ALL FORTH AS IF IN ONE SENTENCE A BELL RANG AND HE MADE A LEAP AWAY BEFORE CEDRIC HAD TIME TO SPEAK GOOD BYE HE PANTED WEAR IT WHEN YE GET AMONG THE SWELLS AND HE DARTED OFF AND WAS GONE
AN IF THERE AINT NO BETTER WAY CUM OVER HERE AN GO IN PARDNERS WITH ME
MISTER HOBBS COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE OF HIS SENSES WHEN HE LOOKED ACROSS THE COUNTER AND SAW DICK RUSH IN WITH THE PAPER IN HIS HAND THE BOY WAS OUT OF BREATH WITH RUNNING SO MUCH OUT OF BREATH IN FACT THAT HE COULD SCARCELY SPEAK
THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK AT SHE AINT NO RISTOCRAT SHE AINT WITH WITHERING SCORN SHE'S NO LORD'S WIFE
AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED HE ENJOYED IMMENSELY THE EXCITEMENT AND IMPATIENCE OF THAT MOMENT IF LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY COULD ONLY HAVE LOOKED INTO THE STORE THAT MORNING HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN INTERESTED
THE FELLER THAT GIVE ME THE PAPER HE'S A LAWYER LET'S AX HIM WHAT WE'D BETTER DO LAWYERS KNOWS IT ALL MISTER HOBBS WAS IMMENSELY IMPRESSED BY THIS SUGGESTION AND DICK'S BUSINESS CAPACITY
MUCH TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S ASTONISHMENT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN A VERY YOUNG LAWYER WITH A VERY ENTERPRISING MIND AND A GREAT DEAL OF SPARE TIME ON HIS HANDS HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SO READILY INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY
IT OFTTIMES REQUIRES HEROIC COURAGE TO FACE FRUITLESS EFFORT TO TAKE UP THE BROKEN STRANDS OF A LIFE WORK TO LOOK BRAVELY TOWARD THE FUTURE AND PROCEED UNDAUNTED ON OUR WAY
AND THE ANGRY WATERS SCATTERED THE LOGS FAR AND WIDE THE CHIEF OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC DEPARTMENT AT WASHINGTON HEARD OF THE FAILURE OF THE EXPERIMENT AND AT ONCE SENT WORD TO SHIPMASTERS THE WORLD OVER
URGING THEM TO WATCH CAREFULLY FOR THESE LOGS WHICH HE DESCRIBED AND TO NOTE THE PRECISE LOCATION OF EACH IN LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AND THE TIME THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE HUNDREDS OF CAPTAINS SAILING OVER THE WATERS OF THE EARTH
BUT THEIR FAILURE TO TRANSMUTE THE BASER METALS INTO GOLD RESULTED IN THE BIRTH OF CHEMISTRY THEY DID NOT SUCCEED IN WHAT THEY ATTEMPTED BUT THEY BROUGHT INTO VOGUE THE NATURAL PROCESSES OF SUBLIMATION FILTRATION
BUSINESS REVERSES AND THE FAILURE OF HIS PARTNER THREW UPON THE BROAD SHOULDERS AND THE STILL BROADER HONOR AND HONESTY OF SIR WALTER SCOTT A BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT FORCED HIM TO WRITE
HIS BRUSH STROKES PUT ON IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS BEFORE GOING TO HIS MENIAL DUTIES AS A RAILWAY PORTER IN THE DUSK LIKE THAT PERPETUATED ON HIS CANVAS MEANT STRENGTH FOOD AND MEDICINE FOR THE DYING WIFE HE ADORED
THIS PURGING OF ALL THE DROSS OF TRIVIALITY AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE FURNACE OF POVERTY TRIAL AND SORROW GAVE ELOQUENCE TO HIS BRUSH AND ENABLED HIM TO PAINT AS NEVER BEFORE AS NO PROSPERITY WOULD HAVE MADE POSSIBLE
FAILURE IS OFTEN THE TURNING POINT THE PIVOT OF CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SWINGS US TO HIGHER LEVELS IT MAY NOT BE FINANCIAL SUCCESS IT MAY NOT BE FAME IT MAY BE NEW DRAUGHTS OF SPIRITUAL MORAL OR MENTAL INSPIRATION
MELTED INTO THIN AIR AS HIS HAND SOUGHT TO CLUTCH IT FAILURE IS OFTEN THE ROCK BOTTOM FOUNDATION OF REAL SUCCESS IF MAN IN A FEW INSTANCES OF HIS LIFE CAN SAY
LEAVING THE RESULTS TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE INFINITE IF WE THINK OF ANY SUPREME MOMENT OF OUR LIVES ANY GREAT SUCCESS ANY ONE WHO IS DEAR TO US AND THEN CONSIDER HOW WE REACHED THAT MOMENT THAT SUCCESS
WE WILL SEE HOW LOGICAL HAS BEEN THE COURSE OF OUR JOY AND SUCCESS FROM SORROW AND FAILURE AND THAT WHAT GIVES US MOST HAPPINESS TO DAY IS INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED WITH WHAT ONCE CAUSED US SORROW
THEY NEED NOT DISHEARTEN US THEY SHOULD PROVE SOURCES OF NEW STRENGTH THE ROCKY WAY MAY PROVE SAFER THAN THE SLIPPERY PATH OF SMOOTHNESS BIRDS CANNOT FLY BEST WITH THE WIND BUT AGAINST IT SHIPS DO NOT PROGRESS IN CALM
IS TO EXPLORE VARIOUS VIEWS WHICH ARE HELD BY LEADING AUTHORITIES AT PRESENT IT CAN BE SAID HOWEVER THAT A MAJORITY OF AUTHORITIES AGREE THAT HYPNOSIS ENSUES AS A RESULT OF NATURAL LAWS
WHICH HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN THE HUMAN ORGANISM SINCE THE BEGINNING OF MAN AS HE IS TODAY THE OLDER THEORIES SHOW ALMOST AS MUCH DISPARITY AS TODAY BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF HISTORY
BOTH NAMES LOOM LARGE IN THE HISTORY OF HYPNOSIS MESMER AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PHYSICIAN BELIEVED THAT HYPNOSIS OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF VITAL FLUIDS DRAWN FROM A MAGNET OR LODESTONE
PRODUCED AT LOURDES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS HEALING SHRINES HIS FORMULA IS THAT FAITH HOPE BELIEF AND EXPECTATION ALL CATALYZED BY THE IMAGINATION LEAD INEVITABLY TO HYPNOSIS
CAN BE PRODUCED AT A NON HYPNOTIC LEVEL A LARGE NUMBER OF HYPNOTISTS INCLUDING THE AUTHOR HAS COME TO BELIEVE THAT HYPNOSIS IS A SEMANTIC PROBLEM IN WHICH WORDS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO SUCCESS NOT JUST ANY WORDS
ACTUALLY HYPNOTISTS TODAY
MEANING THAT IT CONSTITUTES A GROUP OF UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY BE DREDGED UP TO REPLACE THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS AUTOMATICISM OF COURSE IS INHERENTLY PART OF THIS VIEW AND IS PRESUMED TO NEGATE VOLITION ACTIVITY OF THE CEREBRUM
WHICH CONTROLS THE CONSCIOUS AND VOLUNTARY SYSTEM IS RENDERED NON OPERATIONAL MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER ARE THAT HYPNOSIS RESULTS FROM FIRST OF ALL A GOOD TRANSFERENCE SECONDLY FROM A CONDITIONED REFLEX
AND SO IN MY VIEW
SUPREME CONTROL OF AGE YOUTH IS ETERNAL NATURE NEVER GROWS OLD THE FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN EDEN ARE BLOOMING TO DAY JUST AS LOVELY JUST AS SWEET
GROWING OLD IS A HABIT PEOPLE TRAVEL ALONG THE YEARS UP THE HILL OF LIFE TILL THEY REACH A CERTAIN POINT WHERE THEY BEGIN TO THINK THEY MUST BE GROWING OLD THINK ITS TIME TO SAG THINK ITS TIME TO DROOP
AND THEY ARE OLD LIFE IS ENDLESS BUT YOU CAN THINK IT SHORT THE POWER OF AN ENDLESS LIFE IS WITHIN YOU BUT BY THINKING YOU CAN TURN IT TO THE WHITE ASHES OF OLD AGE THINK YOUTH
AND YOU STAY YOUNG YOUTH IS GROWTH KEEP GROWING AND YOU KEEP YOUNG A NEW IDEA WILL MAKE YOU FEEL YOUNGER DEVELOP IT AND IT WILL DEVELOP YOU QUICKEN YOUR MENTAL THROB WITH NEW IDEAS
BEGIN NOW STOP TALKING ABOUT BEING TOO OLD TO GROW YOU PASS BY TREES DAILY A HUNDRED
LEARN TO LOVE WORK FOR THE HAPPINESS IT BRINGS PUT JOY INTO YOUR WORK IN THE MORNING AND YOU WILL FIND IT MULTIPLIED INTO HAPPINESS AT NIGHT WORK IS A LAW OF YOUTH INACTION IS DECAY
INERTIA IS DEATH MEN AND WOMEN DO NOT USUALLY LOSE THEIR POSITIONS THEY DRIVE THEIR POSITIONS AWAY FROM THEM THE LAW OF WORK WILL NOT STAND PERSONAL ABUSE
CULTIVATE AN INFECTIOUS LAUGH MIRTH MAKES WORK EASY READ HUMOR AND LEARN TO TELL IT PRACTICE TELLING A GOOD FUNNY STORY BE A QUICK WIT THERE IS A BRIGHT SIDE TO EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD
LET THINE HEART CHEER THEE GIVE IT OUT LET GO TO SLEEP WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE AND YOU WILL AWAKEN WITH A JOY IN YOUR HEART LET YOUR HUMOR BE RICH HUMOR LAUGHTER IS THE CIPHER KEY TO A MAN
LIKE A MEDICINE TO FORGET YOUR SORROW BEGIN TO CULTIVATE JOY KEEP AWAY FROM SAD PEOPLE OR YOU WILL BE SAD STOP REHEARSING YOUR GRIEF YOU ONLY ENLARGE IT IF YOU SUFFER GRIEF
OF ABSOLUTE PERSONALITY NOTHING THAT HAS LIFE IS GOD DAMNED WHERE LOVE IS ONLY A DREAM THE MARRIAGE IS AN ALARM CLOCK IF YOU CANNOT ENDURE YOUR MOTHER IN LAW
STRENGTH AND WHITENESS THOUGHT JANE AS SHE PACED THE STEAMER'S DECK AND AFTER A TWO YEARS ABSENCE HER HEART WENT OUT TO HER NATIVE LAND THEN DOVER CASTLE CAUGHT HER EYE SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PEARLY LIGHT OF THAT SPRING AFTERNOON
AND THIS NIGHT AND DAY TRAVELLING HAD BROUGHT HER AT LAST WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SHORES OF ENGLAND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WOULD SET FOOT UPON THEM AND THEN THERE WOULD BE BUT TWO MORE STAGES TO HER JOURNEY FOR FROM THE MOMENT SHE STARTED
THAT JANE'S HALF CROWN WAS NOT A PENNY HE HAD A SICK YOUNG WIFE AT HOME WHO HAD BEEN ORDERED EXTRA NOURISHMENT AND JUST AS THE RUSH ON BOARD BEGAN HE HAD PUT UP A SIMPLE PRAYER TO THE HEAVENLY FATHER
SEVEN PENCE APENNY OF THIS STUFF AIN'T MUCH FOR CARRYING ALL THAT ALONG I DON'T THINK GRUMBLED HIS MATE AND JANE'S YOUNG PORTER EXPERIENCED THE DOUBLE JOY OF FAITH CONFIRMED AND WILLING SERVICE GENEROUSLY REWARDED A TELEGRAPH BOY WALKED ALONG THE TRAIN SAYING
HERE YOU HAVE DONE VERY WELL FOR ME NO NEVER MIND THE CHANGE COFFEE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE SHOULD FETCH A FANCY PRICE GOOD BYE THE TRAIN MOVED ON AND THE PORTER STOOD LOOKING AFTER IT WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES
A GREAT CALM TOOK ITS PLACE AND JANE DROPPED QUIETLY OFF TO SLEEP YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS WASHED AND BRUSHED AND GREATLY REFRESHED
AND HER OWN MAID WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN A PLACE IN THE DUCHESS'S HOUSEHOLD IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS ON THE PLATFORM AND HER HAND WAS IN DERYCK'S THAT IS RIGHT DEAR HE SAID ALL FIT AND WELL I CAN SEE NOW HAND OVER YOUR KEYS
WHEN ALL WERE GONE I LEARNT THAT THE VILE SLANDER HAD INDEED BEEN CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF THE VICTIM ROSE HOWEVER VOWED SHE DID NOT AND WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT
NO CERTAINLY BUT THEN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HER I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THAT VERY EVENING THAT I VENTURED ON ANOTHER INVASION OF WILDFELL HALL FROM THE TIME OF OUR PARTY
WITH THE PROSPECT OF BEING GRAVELY USHERED IN BY RACHEL TO THE PRESENCE OF A SURPRISED UNCORDIAL MISTRESS THAT SO GREATLY DISTURBED ME MY WISH HOWEVER WAS NOT GRATIFIED
HE RAN TO PERFORM MY BIDDING AND QUICKLY RETURNED WITH HIS MOTHER HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKED WITH HER DARK RINGLETS STREAMING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE HER FAIR CHEEK SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND HER COUNTENANCE RADIANT WITH SMILES
THERE IS NO MEDIATOR LIKE A MERRY SIMPLE HEARTED CHILD EVER READY TO CEMENT DIVIDED HEARTS TO SPAN THE UNFRIENDLY GULF OF CUSTOM TO MELT THE ICE OF COLD RESERVE AND OVERTHROW THE SEPARATING WALLS OF DREAD FORMALITY AND PRIDE
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN AND HOW YOUR SISTER'S ROOTS HAVE PROSPERED IN MY CHARGE ADDED SHE AS SHE OPENED THE GATE AND WE SAUNTERED THROUGH THE GARDEN AND TALKED OF THE FLOWERS THE TREES AND THE BOOK
THERE WAS A PERPLEXED AND THOUGHTFUL PAUSE IS IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME RASH VOW IT IS SOMETHING OF THE KIND SHE ANSWERED SOME DAY I MAY TELL YOU BUT AT PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME
PROVIDED YOU NEVER ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE I MAKE NO EMPTY PROMISES BUT YOU SHALL SEE THE MOMENT YOU DO OUR INTIMACY IS AT AN END THAT'S ALL AND WILL YOU ALWAYS CALL ME GILBERT
AND I OFTEN FELT MYSELF A MOST CONFOUNDED HYPOCRITE WITH IT ALL I SAW TOO OR RATHER I FELT THAT IN SPITE OF HERSELF I WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO HER AS THE NOVEL HEROES MODESTLY EXPRESS IT
YOU'RE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL AREN'T YOU WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO SO OFTEN NONSENSE CHILD I DON'T GO ONCE IN SIX WEEKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BOTH AT THE WILSONS AND THE VICARAGE AND BESIDES MAMMA SAYS IF SHE WERE A PROPER PERSON SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING THERE BY HERSELF AND DON'T YOU REMEMBER LAST WINTER GILBERT ALL THAT ABOUT THE FALSE NAME TO THE PICTURE
FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER
BUT THEY DON'T SPEAK OPENLY TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS IT IS ONLY BY HINTS AND INNUENDOES AND BY WHAT I HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THEY THINK WELL THEN I WON'T GO TO DAY AS IT'S GETTING LATISH
IS IT SIR SAID I AY IT IS SO HE ADDED AN AFFIRMATORY NOD AND CONTINUED TO GAZE UPON ME WITH A KIND OF IRATE SOLEMNITY HOLDING HIS SUBSTANTIAL STICK BETWEEN HIS KNEES
IT WILL BE READY IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HE REJECTED THE OFFER WITH A MAJESTIC WAVE OF THE HAND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL TAKE MISSUS MARKHAM SAID HE I'LL TAKE A GLASS OF YOUR EXCELLENT ALE
BUT SHE OFFERED NO EXTENUATION OR DEFENCE AND WITH A KIND OF SHAMELESS CALMNESS SHOCKING INDEED TO WITNESS IN ONE SO YOUNG AS GOOD AS TOLD ME THAT MY REMONSTRANCE WAS UNAVAILING AND MY PASTORAL ADVICE QUITE THROWN AWAY UPON HER
O KING I SEE YOU A FAMOUS CONQUEROR THE MASTER OF MANY NATIONS I SEE YOU GOING FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY DEFEATING ARMIES AND DESTROYING CITIES UNTIL MEN CALL YOU THE FEAR OF THE WORLD YOU HEAP UP VAST RICHES
NOTICED BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE OXEN THE SHEPHERD FOLLOWED THE STREAK OF BLOOD THROUGH THE GRASS AND AT LAST FOUND THE SHARP POINT OF A SWORD STICKING OUT OF THE EARTH HE DUG OUT THE WEAPON CARRIED IT TO THE PALACE
ATTILA AND HIS TERRIBLE HUNS MARCHED THROUGH GAUL UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE CITY OF ORLEANS HERE THE PEOPLE BRAVELY RESISTED THE INVADERS THEY SHUT THEIR GATES AND DEFENDED THEMSELVES IN EVERY WAY THEY COULD
WERE NOT SAFE WITHOUT HIGH AND STRONG WALLS ATTILA TRIED TO TAKE ORLEANS BUT SOON AFTER HE BEGAN TO ATTACK THE WALLS HE SAW A GREAT ARMY AT A DISTANCE COMING TOWARDS THE CITY
THOR'IS MOND THE SON OF THEODORIC
HERE I WILL PERISH IN THE FLAMES HE CRIED RATHER THAN SURRENDER TO MY ENEMIES
AND THEY HAD NO ARMY STRONG ENOUGH TO SEND AGAINST HIM ROME WOULD HAVE BEEN AGAIN DESTROYED IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR POPE LEO
BUT A PLOT WAS FORMED AGAINST HIM
TO THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER WHEN THE EMPEROR MAXIMUS HEARD THAT THE VANDALS WERE COMING HE PREPARED TO FLEE FROM THE CITY AND HE ADVISED THE SENATE TO DO THE SAME THE PEOPLE WERE SO ANGRY AT THIS
SOME YEARS AFTER THE CAPTURE OF ROME BY GENSERIC THERE WAS A ROMAN EMPEROR NAMED MA JO'RI AN HE WAS A GOOD RULER AND A BRAVE MAN THE VANDALS STILL CONTINUED TO ATTACK AND PLUNDER CITIES IN ITALY
BUT THE CUNNING VANDAL WAS NOT THINKING OF PEACE HE ONLY WANTED TIME TO CARRY OUT A PLAN HE HAD MADE TO DESTROY THE ROMAN FLEET ONE DARK NIGHT DURING THE TRUCE HE FILLED THE LARGEST OF HIS SHIPS
IN THE TIME OF CLOVIS THE COUNTRY NOW CALLED BULGARIA WAS INHABITED BY GOTHS ONE DAY A POOR SHEPHERD BOY ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE LEFT HIS MOUNTAIN HOME IN THAT COUNTRY TO GO TO THE CITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE WHICH WAS MANY MILES AWAY
AND TRUDGED ALONG THE VALLEY IN HIGH HOPE FEELING CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD REACH THE END OF HIS JOURNEY IN SAFETY
HE LEFT FIVE MEN AS A GUARD IN EACH VESSEL AND WITH THE BODY OF HIS ARMY HE MARCHED FOR SOME DAYS ALONG THE COAST THE PEOPLE RECEIVED HIM IN A FRIENDLY WAY FOR THEY HAD GROWN TIRED OF THE RULE OF THE VANDALS
BUT IN A FEW MONTHS VIT'I GES KING OF THE GOTHS APPEARED WITH AN ARMY BEFORE THE GATES AND CHALLENGED BELISARIUS AND NARSES TO COME OUT AND FIGHT THE ROMAN GENERALS HOWEVER
THAT PEOPLE GAVE HIM THE NAME OF EL AMIN WHICH MEANS THE TRUTHFUL AT THIS TIME HE WAS ONLY SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE BUT THE RICH TRADERS HAD SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM THAT THEY GAVE HIM IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO AND TRUSTED HIM WITH LARGE SUMS OF MONEY
AND FAITHFULLY PAID OVER TO THE OWNERS OF THE GOODS THE MONEY HE HAD RECEIVED MOHAMMED HAD NO SCHOOL EDUCATION HE COULD NEITHER READ NOR WRITE BUT HE WAS NOT IGNORANT HE KNEW WELL HOW TO DO THE WORK INTRUSTED TO HIM AND
KHADIJAH THEN ENGAGED HIM AS THE MANAGER OF HER BUSINESS AND HE SERVED HER WELL AND FAITHFULLY SHE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF HIM
WORSHIPED IDOLS VERY FEW OF THEM WERE CHRISTIANS
HE WENT ON TELLING ABOUT THE APPEARANCE OF GABRIEL AND PREACHING THE DOCTRINES WHICH HE SAID THE ANGEL HAD ORDERED HIM TO TEACH THE PEOPLE
PEOPLE CAME FROM DISTANT PARTS OF ARABIA AND FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO HEAR HIM ONE DAY SIX OF THE CHIEF MEN OF ME DI'NA
AND WISHED HIM TO COME AND LIVE AMONG THEM SO HE SECRETLY LEFT HIS NATIVE TOWN AND FLED FROM HIS ENEMIES WITH A FEW FAITHFUL COMPANIONS HE MADE HIS ESCAPE TO MEDINA
THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE A SPLENDID CHURCH WAS BUILT FOR HIM IN MEDINA IT WAS CALLED A MOSQUE AND ALL MOHAMMEDAN CHURCHES OR PLACES OF WORSHIP
HE WAS BURIED IN THE MOSQUE IN WHICH HE HAD HELD RELIGIOUS SERVICES FOR SO MANY YEARS
THERE IS A MOSQUE CALLED THE GREAT MOSQUE IT IS A LARGE ENCLOSURE IN THE FORM OF A QUADRANGLE OR SQUARE
RIGHT OFF I OBSERVED A CLUSTER OF MOUNTAINS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET HIGH WHOSE SHAPES WERE VERY WHIMSICALLY SCULPTED AFTER OUR POSITION FIX I REENTERED THE LOUNGE AND WHEN OUR BEARINGS WERE REPORTED ON THE CHART I SAW THAT WE WERE OFF THE ISLAND OF CEYLON
ITS LENGTH IS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILES ITS MAXIMUM WIDTH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES ITS CIRCUMFERENCE NINE HUNDRED MILES ITS SURFACE AREA TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT SQUARE MILES
DIVE IN ROTATION AND DESCEND TO A DEPTH OF TWELVE METERS WITH THE HELP OF A HEAVY STONE CLUTCHED BETWEEN THEIR FEET AND ATTACHED BY A ROPE TO THEIR BOAT YOU MEAN I SAID
THEIR VISION WEAKENS ULCERS BREAK OUT ON THEIR EYES SORES FORM ON THEIR BODIES AND SOME ARE EVEN STRICKEN WITH APOPLEXY ON THE OCEAN FLOOR YES I SAID IT'S A SAD OCCUPATION
THIS STRUCK ME AS A PRETTY NEEDLESS QUESTION TO SAY THE LEAST WELL CAPTAIN NEMO WENT ON I ADMIT CAPTAIN I'M NOT YET ON VERY FAMILIAR TERMS WITH THAT GENUS OF FISH WE'RE USED TO THEM
THE REST OF US CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED AND IN TIME YOU WILL BE TOO ANYHOW WE'LL BE ARMED AND ON OUR WAY WE MIGHT HUNT A MAN EATER OR TWO IT'S A FASCINATING SPORT SO PROFESSOR I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT MANY WHO FACE THOSE FEARSOME ANIMALS DON'T COME BACK ALIVE BESIDES I'M NOT A NEGRO AND EVEN IF I WERE A NEGRO IN THIS INSTANCE I DON'T THINK A LITTLE HESITATION ON MY PART WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE
DANGER HOWEVER GREAT HELD A PERENNIAL ATTRACTION FOR HIS AGGRESSIVE NATURE I WENT BACK TO READING SIRR'S BOOK BUT I LEAFED THROUGH IT MECHANICALLY BETWEEN THE LINES I KEPT SEEING FEARSOME WIDE OPEN JAWS
HAS JUST MADE US A VERY PLEASANT PROPOSITION OH I SAID YOU KNOW ABOUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER HAS INVITED US TOGETHER WITH MASTER
CONSEIL SAID TO ME GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND ON PEARL FISHING ON THE FISHING ITSELF I ASKED OR ON THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS THAT ON THE FISHING THE CANADIAN REPLIED BEFORE WE TACKLE THE TERRAIN IT HELPS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH IT
LINING THE INSIDES OF THEIR VALVES ARE MUSSELS INCLUDED TOO THE CANADIAN ASKED YES THE MUSSELS OF CERTAIN STREAMS IN SCOTLAND WALES IRELAND SAXONY BOHEMIA AND FRANCE
THEN THEY REMOVE THE OYSTER'S MEATY TISSUE BOIL IT AND FINALLY STRAIN IT IN ORDER TO EXTRACT EVEN THE SMALLEST PEARLS DO THE PRICES OF THESE PEARLS DIFFER DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE CONSEIL ASKED NOT ONLY ON THEIR SIZE I REPLIED
THEY FORM IN ISOLATION WITHIN THE MOLLUSK'S TISSUE THEY'RE WHITE OFTEN OPAQUE BUT SOMETIMES OF OPALESCENT TRANSPARENCY AND USUALLY SPHERICAL OR PEAR SHAPED THE SPHERICAL ONES ARE MADE INTO BRACELETS
HOW INGENIOUS CONSEIL SAID TO REDUCE DIVIDING AND CLASSIFYING PEARLS TO A MECHANICAL OPERATION AND COULD MASTER TELL US THE PROFITS BROUGHT IN BY HARVESTING THESE BANKS OF PEARL OYSTERS ACCORDING TO SIRR'S BOOK I REPLIED
BUT NOW THEY BRING IN ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THAT AMOUNT ALL IN ALL IT'S ESTIMATED THAT NINE MILLION FRANCS IS THE CURRENT YEARLY RETURN FOR THE WHOLE PEARL HARVESTING INDUSTRY BUT CONSEIL ASKED
MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED LAUGHING THOSE WERE ARTIFICIAL PEARLS ORDINARY GLASS BEADS WHOSE INSIDES WERE COATED WITH ESSENCE OF ORIENT WOW
THAT ESSENCE OF ORIENT MUST SELL FOR QUITE A LARGE SUM AS LITTLE AS ZERO IT COMES FROM THE SCALES OF A EUROPEAN CARP IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A SILVER SUBSTANCE THAT COLLECTS IN THE WATER AND IS PRESERVED IN AMMONIA IT'S WORTHLESS
CONSEIL SAID QUICKLY YES I SAID TWO MILLION FRANCS AND NO DOUBT ALL IT COST OUR CAPTAIN WAS THE EFFORT TO PICK IT UP HA NED LAND EXCLAIMED DURING OUR STROLL TOMORROW WHO SAYS WE WON'T RUN INTO ONE JUST LIKE IT
THE CANADIAN REPLIED I'M A PROFESSIONAL HARPOONER IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE A MOCKERY OF THEM IT ISN'T AN ISSUE I SAID OF FISHING FOR THEM WITH A SWIVEL HOOK HOISTING THEM ONTO THE DECK OF A SHIP
OPENING THE BELLY RIPPING OUT THE HEART AND TOSSING IT INTO THE SEA SO IT'S AN ISSUE OF YES PRECISELY IN THE WATER IN THE WATER YE GODS JUST GIVE ME A GOOD HARPOON
WASH WILLIAMS HAD BEEN CALLED THE BEST TELEGRAPH OPERATOR IN THE STATE AND IN SPITE OF HIS DEGRADEMENT TO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG HE WAS STILL PROUD OF HIS ABILITY
WASH WILLIAMS WAS A MAN OF COURAGE A THING HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THAT MADE HIM HATE LIFE AND HE HATED IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH THE ABANDON OF A POET FIRST OF ALL HE HATED WOMEN
IN ALL OF WINESBURG THERE WAS BUT ONE PERSON WHO KNEW THE STORY OF THE THING THAT HAD MADE UGLY THE PERSON AND THE CHARACTER OF WASH WILLIAMS
BESIDE THE RAILROAD STATION AND SAW WASH WILLIAMS APPARENTLY ASLEEP ON THE GRASS BENEATH A TREE ON THE NEXT EVENING THE OPERATOR AND GEORGE WILLARD WALKED OUT TOGETHER DOWN THE RAILROAD THEY WENT
AND SAT ON A PILE OF DECAYING RAILROAD TIES BESIDE THE TRACKS IT WAS THEN THAT THE OPERATOR TOLD THE YOUNG REPORTER HIS STORY OF HATE PERHAPS A DOZEN TIMES
HE WAITED EXPECTANTLY WHEN THE OPERATOR REMAINED SILENT AND SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT TALKING HE TRIED TO MAKE CONVERSATION WERE YOU EVER MARRIED MISTER WILLIAMS HE BEGAN
I SUPPOSE YOU WERE AND YOUR WIFE IS DEAD IS THAT IT WASH WILLIAMS SPAT FORTH A SUCCESSION OF VILE OATHS YES SHE IS DEAD HE AGREED SHE IS DEAD AS ALL WOMEN ARE DEAD
THERE WAS SOMETHING ALMOST BEAUTIFUL IN THE VOICE OF WASH WILLIAMS THE HIDEOUS TELLING HIS STORY OF HATE THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR OF WINESBURG SITTING IN THE DARKNESS ON THE RAILROAD TIES HAD BECOME A POET
HATRED HAD RAISED HIM TO THAT ELEVATION IT IS BECAUSE I SAW YOU KISSING THE LIPS OF THAT BELLE CARPENTER THAT I TELL YOU MY STORY HE SAID WHAT HAPPENED TO ME MAY NEXT HAPPEN TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS A CATCH IN THE VOICE OF THE MAN TALKING IN THE DARKNESS I LOVED HER HE SAID I DON'T CLAIM NOT TO BE A FOOL I LOVE HER YET THERE IN THE DUSK IN THE SPRING EVENING
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING WHEN SHE HAD GONE I CRIED LIKE A SILLY BOY PRETTY SOON I HAD A CHANCE TO SELL THE HOUSE AND I SENT THAT MONEY TO HER WASH WILLIAMS AND GEORGE WILLARD
AGAIN THE MAN'S VOICE BECAME SOFT AND LOW SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM NAKED HE WENT ON HER MOTHER DID THAT WHILE I SAT THERE SHE WAS TAKING THE GIRL'S CLOTHES OFF PERHAPS COAXING HER TO DO IT
FIRST I HEARD VOICES AT THE DOOR THAT LED INTO A LITTLE HALLWAY
YOU SEE WAITING GEORGE WILLARD AND THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR CAME INTO THE MAIN STREET OF WINESBURG THE LIGHTS FROM THE STORE WINDOWS LAY BRIGHT AND SHINING ON THE SIDEWALKS PEOPLE MOVED ABOUT LAUGHING AND TALKING
WHO WERE INCAPABLE OF OPPRESSING THE WEAK OR OF PERMITTING THEIR COUNTRY WITH THEIR CONSENT TO OPPRESS THE WEAK BUT WHO DID NOT HESITATE TO DRAW THE SWORD WHEN TO LEAVE IT UNDRAWN MEANT INABILITY TO ARREST TRIUMPHANT WRONG
WHO ARE READY ENOUGH TO PRAISE WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST AND YET ARE INCAPABLE OF PROFITING BY IT WHEN FACED BY THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT DURING OUR GENERATION THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PECULIARLY THE CASE AMONG THE MEN
THE WORST INFAMIES OF MODERN TIMES SUCH AFFAIRS AS THE MASSACRES OF THE ARMENIANS BY THE TURKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED IN A TIME OF NOMINALLY PROFOUND INTERNATIONAL PEACE
AND THEIR ABANDONMENT OF THEIR ARMED FORCES OR ELSE THEY WRITE WELL MEANING SOLEMN LITTLE BOOKS OR PAMPHLETS OR EDITORIALS AND ARTICLES IN MAGAZINES OR NEWSPAPERS TO SHOW
SUPPOSE THAT BURGLARY HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND WHITE SLAVERY ARE PROFITABLE IT IS ALMOST USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO ARGUE WITH THESE WELL INTENTIONED PERSONS BECAUSE THEY ARE SUFFERING UNDER AN OBSESSION AND ARE NOT OPEN TO REASON
THEY GO WRONG AT THE OUTSET FOR THEY LAY ALL THE EMPHASIS ON PEACE AND NONE AT ALL ON RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY ARE NOT ALL OF THEM PHYSICALLY TIMID MEN BUT THEY ARE USUALLY MEN
FROM INSULTING OR WRONGING THE PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BUT THEY ALWAYS ARDENTLY ADVOCATE THAT WE IN OUR TURN SHALL TAMELY SUBMIT TO WRONG AND INSULT FROM OTHER NATIONS
LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN CHINA HAS NEITHER A FLEET NOR AN EFFICIENT ARMY IT IS A HUGE CIVILIZED EMPIRE ONE OF THE MOST POPULOUS ON THE GLOBE AND IT HAS BEEN THE HELPLESS PREY
REALIZES THE IDEALS OF THE PERSONS WHO WISH THE UNITED STATES TO DISARM AND THEN TRUST THAT OUR HELPLESSNESS WILL SECURE US A CONTEMPTUOUS IMMUNITY FROM ATTACK BY OUTSIDE NATIONS
THE CHIEF TROUBLE COMES FROM THE ENTIRE INABILITY OF THESE WORTHY PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE DEMANDING THINGS THAT ARE MUTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WHEN THEY DEMAND PEACE AT ANY PRICE AND ALSO JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
UNDER THE MAHDI FOR A DOZEN YEARS AND DURING THOSE DOZEN YEARS THE BIGOTRY TYRANNY AND CRUEL RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WERE SUCH AS FLOURISHED IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY AND IN SPITE OF SYSTEMATIC SLAVE RAIDS
THE POPULATION DECREASED BY NEARLY TWO THIRDS AND PRACTICALLY ALL THE CHILDREN DIED PEACE CAME WELL BEING CAME FREEDOM FROM RAPE AND MURDER AND TORTURE AND HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND EVERY BRUTAL GRATIFICATION OF LUST AND GREED CAME
LOOKING BACK FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A SCORE OF YEARS PROBABLY EVERY ONE WILL AGREE THAT HE WAS AN ABSURD PERSON BUT HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT MORE ABSURD THAN MOST OF THE MORE PROMINENT PERSONS WHO ADVOCATE DISARMAMENT BY THE UNITED STATES
SO FAR I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH OUR GENERAL OUTFIT AND SHALL NOW PASS TO THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT OF THE SHORE PARTY THE HUT WE TOOK OUT WAS BUILT ON MY PROPERTY ON BUNDEFJORD SO THAT I WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE WORK AS IT PROGRESSED
ITS HEIGHT FROM THE FLOOR TO THE RIDGE OF THE ROOF WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET IT WAS BUILT AS AN ORDINARY NORWEGIAN HOUSE WITH POINTED GABLE AND HAD TWO ROOMS ONE OF THESE WAS NINETEEN AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO SERVE AS OUR DORMITORY DINING ROOM AND SITTING ROOM
THERE WERE BUNKS FOR TEN MEN IN TWO STAGES SIX ON ONE WALL AND FOUR ON THE OTHER THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM CONSISTED OF A TABLE A STOOL FOR EACH MAN AND A LUX LAMP
THEY WERE SERVED OUT TO US FROM THE NAVAL STORES THE OTHER FIVE WERE NEW AND WE BOUGHT THEM FROM THE ARMY DEPOTS IT WAS OUR INTENTION TO USE THE TENTS AS TEMPORARY HOUSES THEY WERE EASILY AND QUICKLY SET UP AND WERE STRONG AND WARM
WE HAD TEN SLEDGES MADE BY A FIRM OF SPORTING OUTFITTERS IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE BUILT LIKE THE OLD NANSEN SLEDGES BUT RATHER BROADER AND WERE TWELVE FEET LONG THE RUNNERS WERE OF THE BEST AMERICAN HICKORY SHOD WITH STEEL
THE STEEL SHOEING OF THE RUNNERS WAS WELL COATED WITH RED LEAD AND THE SPARE RUNNERS WITH TAR THESE SLEDGES WERE EXTREMELY STRONGLY BUILT AND COULD STAND ALL KINDS OF WORK ON EVERY SORT OF SURFACE AT THAT TIME
ONE MAN WAS SUFFICIENT TO SET UP THE TENT IN THE STIFFEST BREEZE I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FEWER POLES A TENT HAS THE EASIER IT IS TO SET UP WHICH SEEMS QUITE NATURAL THESE TENTS HAVE ONLY ONE POLE
WE MAY DIVIDE IT INTO TWO CLASSES THE OUTFIT FOR SPECIALLY LOW TEMPERATURES AND THAT FOR MORE MODERATE TEMPERATURES IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD YET WINTERED ON THE BARRIER SO WE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING
THIS TIME HE PROCURED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GOOD REINDEER SKINS DRESSED BY THE LAPPS AND SENT THEM TO CHRISTIANIA HERE I HAD GREAT TROUBLE IN FINDING A MAN WHO COULD SEW SKINS BUT AT LAST I FOUND ONE
WE ALSO HAD A DOZEN THIN SLEEPING BAGS WHICH I THOUGHT OF USING INSIDE THE BIG THICK ONES IF THE COLD SHOULD BE TOO SEVERE EVERYTHING WAS FINISHED BUT NOT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT THE OUTER SLEEPING BAGS WERE MADE BY MISTER BRANDT FURRIER OF BERGEN
AND THEY WERE SO EXCELLENT BOTH IN MATERIAL AND MAKING UP THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE DONE BETTER IT WAS A MODEL PIECE OF WORK TO SAVE THIS OUTER SLEEPING BAG WE HAD IT PROVIDED WITH A COVER OF THE LIGHTEST CANVAS
WHICH WAS A GOOD DEAL LONGER THAN THE BAG ITSELF IT WAS EASY TO TIE THE END OF THE COVER TOGETHER LIKE THE MOUTH OF THE SACK AND THIS KEPT THE SNOW OUT OF THE BAG DURING THE DAY'S MARCH
OUR BURBERRY WIND CLOTHES WERE MADE IN THE FORM OF ANORAK BLOUSE AND TROUSERS BOTH VERY ROOMY THE OTHERS CONSISTED OF TROUSERS AND JACKET WITH HOOD OUR MITS WERE FOR THE MOST PART SUCH AS ONE CAN BUY IN ANY SHOP
BESIDES THESE WE HAD TEN PAIRS OF ORDINARY KID MITS WHICH WERE BOUGHT AT A GLOVE SHOP IN CHRISTIANIA AND WERE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WEAR OUT I WORE MINE FROM FRAMHEIM TO THE POLE AND BACK AGAIN AND AFTERWARDS ON THE VOYAGE TO TASMANIA
TO CARRY ONE'S CAUTION TO LENGTHS WHICH MAY SEEM RIDICULOUS NOW IT IS A FACT THAT IF ONE CAN WEAR SOFT FOOT GEAR EXCLUSIVELY THE RISK OF FROST BITE IS FAR LESS THAN IF ONE IS COMPELLED TO WEAR STIFF BOOTS IN SOFT FOOT GEAR OF COURSE
THE FOOT CAN MOVE FAR MORE EASILY AND KEEP WARM BUT WE WERE TO TAKE SKI AND TO GET FULL USE OUT OF THEM SO THAT IN ANY CASE WE HAD TO HAVE A STIFF SOLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE BINDINGS IT IS OF NO USE TO HAVE A GOOD BINDING UNLESS YOU CAN USE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY
OR GAVE US ALL MORE WORK IN THE COURSE OF THE EXPEDITION THAN THE STIFF OUTER COVERING WHICH WE HAD TO HAVE BUT WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM AT LAST I APPLIED TO ONE OF THE LEADING MAKERS OF SKI BOOTS IN CHRISTIANIA AND EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTY TO HIM
WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY A CHILD'S FOOT WITH TWO PAIRS OF REINDEER SKIN STOCKINGS ON AND TEN PAIRS WERE MADE
I NEVER WENT THAT WAY AGAIN UNTIL I WAS CERTAIN THAT THE EXHIBITION WAS CLOSED ONE THING IS CERTAIN THAT THE BOOTS WERE A FINE PIECE OF WORKMANSHIP WE SHALL HEAR LATER ON OF THE ALTERATIONS THEY HAD TO UNDERGO BEFORE WE AT LAST MADE THEM AS LARGE AS WE WANTED
FOR THE GIANT BOOTS TURNED OUT MUCH TOO SMALL AMONG OTHER EQUIPMENT I MUST MENTION OUR EXCELLENT PRIMUS COOKING APPARATUS THIS ALL CAME COMPLETE FROM A FIRM IN STOCKHOLM FOR COOKING ON SLEDGE JOURNEYS THE PRIMUS STOVE RANKS ABOVE ALL OTHERS
BUT WERE UNFORTUNATELY OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP ON THE MAIN SOUTHERN JOURNEY WE WERE SO MANY IN A TENT AND SPACE WAS SO LIMITED THAT I DARED NOT RISK USING IT IF ONE HAS ROOM ENOUGH IT IS IDEAL IN MY OPINION
SO THAT THE DANGER OF FALLING THROUGH WAS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED THE EXERTION OF PULLING IS ALSO LESS TRYING WITH ALASKA HARNESS THAN WITH THE GREENLAND KIND AS THE ALASKA HARNESS HAS A SHALLOW PADDED COLLAR
THE BEST PROOF OF THIS WAS THAT THE LIQUID IN OUR COMPASSES FROZE BEFORE THE SPIRITS IN A FLASK WE WERE NATURALLY INCONVENIENCED BY THIS BESIDES THESE WE HAD AN ORDINARY LITTLE POCKET COMPASS TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS ONE BY ZEISS AND THE OTHER BY GOERTZ
IT IS CERTAINLY NOT A PICTURESQUE COUNTRY IT PRESENTS NO GRAND OR EXTENSIVE VIEWS BUT THE FEATURES ARE SMALL RATHER THAN PLAIN THE SURFACE CONTINUALLY SWELLS AND SINKS BUT THE HILLS ARE NOT BOLD NOR THE VALLEYS DEEP
IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE PRETTIEST SPOTS
COMPARED WITH THE BROAD RIVER THE RICH VALLEY AND THE NOBLE HILLS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BEHOLD AT HER NATIVE HOME NEAR HENLEY UPON THAMES THE HOUSE ITSELF STOOD IN A SHALLOW VALLEY SURROUNDED BY SLOPING MEADOWS WELL SPRINKLED WITH ELM TREES AT THE END OF A SMALL VILLAGE OF COTTAGES
EACH WELL PROVIDED WITH A GARDEN SCATTERED ABOUT PRETTILY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMMODIOUS TO HOLD PUPILS IN ADDITION TO A GROWING FAMILY AND WAS IN THOSE TIMES CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF PARSONAGES
NO CORNICE MARKED THE JUNCTION OF WALL AND CEILING WHILE THE BEAMS WHICH SUPPORTED THE UPPER FLOORS PROJECTED INTO THE ROOMS BELOW IN ALL THEIR NAKED SIMPLICITY COVERED ONLY BY A COAT OF PAINT OR WHITEWASH
AND NOW AND THEN THE UNWELCOME ADDER TWO SUCH HEDGEROWS RADIATED AS IT WERE FROM THE PARSONAGE GARDEN ONE A CONTINUATION OF THE TURF TERRACE PROCEEDED WESTWARD FORMING THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE HOME MEADOWS
WHO HAVE FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY RENTED IT TOGETHER WITH THE CHIEF FARM IN THE PARISH THE CHURCH ITSELF I SPEAK OF IT AS IT THEN WAS BEFORE THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESENT RECTOR
MIGHT HAVE APPEARED MEAN AND UNINTERESTING TO AN ORDINARY OBSERVER BUT THE ADEPT IN CHURCH ARCHITECTURE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT MUST HAVE STOOD THERE SOME SEVEN CENTURIES AND WOULD HAVE FOUND BEAUTY IN THE VERY NARROW EARLY ENGLISH WINDOWS
AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR OWN PARENTS THE TWO YOUNG COOPERS PAID LONG VISITS AT STEVENTON EDWARD COOPER DID NOT LIVE UNDISTINGUISHED
SHE AND HER SECOND HUSBAND WENT TO FRANCE IN THE HOPE OF RECOVERING SOME OF THE COUNT'S PROPERTY AND THERE NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING INCLUDED AMONGST THE DETENUS ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN BY BUONAPARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN ALL ENGLISH TRAVELLERS
AND IT MAY BE REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT SOME OF THE INCIDENTS AND FEELINGS WHICH ARE SO VIVIDLY PAINTED IN THE MANSFIELD PARK THEATRICALS ARE DUE TO HER RECOLLECTIONS OF THESE ENTERTAINMENTS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY LEFT STEVENTON ONE GREAT AFFLICTION CAME UPON THE FAMILY
HER REVIEWER IN THE QUARTERLY OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE OBSERVES CONCERNING THE ATTACHMENT OF FANNY PRICE TO EDMUND BERTRAM THE SILENCE IN WHICH THIS PASSION IS CHERISHED THE SLENDER HOPES AND ENJOYMENTS BY WHICH IT IS FED
BUT WHICH THE HISTORIAN HAS THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN RECOVERING AT THAT TIME THE DINNER TABLE PRESENTED A FAR LESS SPLENDID APPEARANCE THAN IT DOES NOW IT WAS APPROPRIATED TO SOLID FOOD RATHER THAN TO FLOWERS FRUITS AND DECORATIONS
NOR WAS THERE MUCH GLITTER OF PLATE UPON IT FOR THE EARLY DINNER HOUR RENDERED CANDLESTICKS UNNECESSARY
POTATOES WERE USED BUT NOT SO ABUNDANTLY AS NOW AND THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT THEY WERE TO BE EATEN ONLY WITH ROAST MEAT THEY WERE NOVELTIES TO A TENANT'S WIFE WHO WAS ENTERTAINED AT STEVENTON PARSONAGE CERTAINLY LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
IT WAS TO BE FOUND ONLY WHERE THERE WAS A DECIDED TASTE FOR MUSIC NOT SO COMMON THEN AS NOW OR IN SUCH GREAT HOUSES AS WOULD PROBABLY CONTAIN A BILLIARD TABLE THERE WOULD OFTEN BE BUT ONE SOFA IN THE HOUSE AND THAT A STIFF ANGULAR
FOR SHE ATTRIBUTES THIS TASTE TO HER FAVOURITE HEROINES
TO GALLOP ALL THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST NIGHT'S PARTNER TO BEHOLD AND HUMBLY HOPE SHE CAUGHT NO COLD BUT THE STATELY MINUET STILL REIGNED SUPREME AND EVERY REGULAR BALL COMMENCED WITH IT IT WAS A SLOW AND SOLEMN MOVEMENT
AND DISTILLING OF HERBS FOR DOMESTIC MEDICINES WHICH ARE NEARLY ALLIED TO THE SAME ART LADIES DID NOT DISDAIN TO SPIN THE THREAD OF WHICH THE HOUSEHOLD LINEN WAS WOVEN SOME LADIES LIKED TO WASH WITH THEIR OWN HANDS THEIR CHOICE CHINA AFTER BREAKFAST OR TEA
BOUGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT IT MUST BE SUPPOSED WITH HIS FATHER'S PERMISSION A PONY FOR A GUINEA AND A HALF AND AFTER RIDING HIM WITH GREAT SUCCESS FOR TWO SEASONS SOLD HIM FOR A GUINEA MORE
BUT MORTAL DAMSELS HAVE LONG AGO DISCARDED THE CLUMSY IMPLEMENT FIRST IT DROPPED ITS IRON RING AND BECAME A CLOG AFTERWARDS IT WAS FINED DOWN INTO THE PLIANT GALOSHE LIGHTER TO WEAR AND MORE EFFECTUAL TO PROTECT
I ADD THE FOLLOWING EPIGRAM WRITTEN BY JANE AUSTEN'S UNCLE MISTER LEIGH PERROT ON READING IN A NEWSPAPER THE MARRIAGE OF CAPTAIN FOOTE TO MISS PATTEN THROUGH THE ROUGH PATHS OF LIFE WITH A PATTEN YOUR GUARD MAY YOU SAFELY AND PLEASANTLY JOG
THIS WAS A BETTER OCCUPATION FOR THEM THAN STRAW PLAITING
CRITICALLY SWEPT FACE AFTER FACE WHICH ONE WAS HERS WHAT IRONY SHE WHOM HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS LIFE TO KNOW FOR WHOM INDEED HE RISKED HIS LIFE EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR
WAS CLOSE TO HIM NOW WITHIN REACH AND AS FAR REMOVED AS THOUGH A THOUSAND MILES SEPARATED THEM SHE WAS THERE BUT HE COULD NOT RECOGNISE A FACE THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN
JIMMIE DALE A BLOCK DOWN HE TURNED FROM BROADWAY OUT OF THE THEATRE CROWDS THAT STREAMED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS PAST HIM THE LETTER
ALMOST FEVERISHLY NOW HE WAS SEEKING AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN AND READ IT UNOBSERVED AN EAGERNESS UPON HIM THAT MINGLED EXHILARATION AT THE LURE OF DANGER WITH A SENSE OF PREMONITION THAT IRRITABLY
SELECTED A CIGARETTE AND FASTIDIOUSLY TAPPED ITS END ON HIS THUMB NAIL INSPECTOR BURTON IN PLAIN CLOTHES HE OBSERVED MUSINGLY TO HIMSELF I WONDER IF IT'S JUST A FLUKE
QUITE EVIDENTLY REGARDLESS OF COST AS A COMBINATION LIBRARY AND STUDY CARLING IN A SOMEWHAT POMPOUS FASHION WALKED STRAIGHT AHEAD TOWARD THE CARVED MAHOGANY FLAT TOPPED DESK AND AS HE REACHED IT
WAVED HIS HAND TAKE A CHAIR HE SAID OVER HIS SHOULDER AND THEN TURNING IN THE ACT OF DROPPING INTO HIS OWN CHAIR GRASPED SUDDENLY AT THE EDGE OF THE DESK INSTEAD
HIS VOICE WAS RISING GRADUALLY WELL SIR LET ME TELL YOU THAT MISTER CARLING SAID JIMMIE DALE IN A LOW EVEN TONE UNLESS YOU MODERATE YOUR VOICE SOME ONE IN THE HOUSE MIGHT HEAR YOU I AM QUITE WELL AWARE OF THAT
EXTRACTED THE KEY FROM THE DOOR LOCK HELD IT UP FOR THE OTHER TO SEE THEN DROPPED IT INTO HIS POCKET AND HIS VOICE COLD BEFORE
JIMMIE DALE MOVED OVER AND STOOD IN FRONT OF CARLING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DESK AND STARED SILENTLY AT THE IMMACULATE FASHIONABLY GROOMED FIGURE BEFORE HIM UNDER THE PROLONGED GAZE CARLING'S COMPOSURE
HE LEANED BACK AND SURVEYED JIMMIE DALE CRITICALLY WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK EYES AH QUITE SO HE OBSERVED THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE MASK BUT I AM STILL A LITTLE IN THE DARK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
I'LL TELEPHONE HEADQUARTERS TO MAKE THE ARREST AT ONCE JUST A MINUTE INTERPOSED JIMMIE DALE GRAVELY I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO A LITTLE STORY FIRST A STORY
YOU WANT TO PLEAD FOR HIM CARLING FLUNG OUT GRUFFLY WELL HE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF ALL THAT BEFORE IT'S QUITE USELESS FOR YOU TO BRING IT UP THE MAN HAS HAD HIS CHANCE ALREADY
BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A WEALTHY MAN IN YOUR OWN RIGHT AND SO IN REALITY YOU WERE ONCE BUT YOU WENT THROUGH YOUR FORTUNE TWO YEARS AGO
WHEN YOU MUST HAVE MONEY OR FACE RUIN AND EXPOSURE YOU SAW IT THEN A YEAR AGO THE DAY THAT MOYNE CONCEALING NOTHING OF HIS PRISON RECORD APPLIED THROUGH FRIENDS FOR A POSITION IN THE BANK
YOUR CO OFFICIALS WERE OPPOSED TO HIS APPOINTMENT BUT YOU DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU PLEADED TO GIVE THE MAN HIS CHANCE AND IN YOUR HELLISH INGENUITY SAW YOUR WAY THEN OUT OF THE TRAP AN EX CONVICT FROM SING SING
WHO WAS ALREADY ASLEEP IN BED
CARLING WAS BABBLING LET ME OUT OF THIS FOR GOD'S SAKE LET ME OUT OF THIS CARLING SAID JIMMIE DALE HOARSELY I STOOD BESIDE A LITTLE BED TO NIGHT AND LOOKED AT A BABY GIRL A LITTLE BABY GIRL WITH GOLDEN HAIR
WHO SMILED AS SHE SLEPT CARLING SHIVERED AND PASSED A SHAKING HAND ACROSS HIS FACE TAKE THIS PEN SAID JIMMIE DALE MONOTONOUSLY OR THIS THE AUTOMATIC
I TOLD HIM WHAT SNAP AND I HAD LEARNED THE RAYS FROM THE MOON PROVING THAT GRANTLINE HAD CONCENTRATED A CONSIDERABLE ORE BODY I ALSO TOLD HIM OF GRANTLINE'S MESSAGE WE'LL STOP ON THE WAY BACK AS HE DIRECTS GREGG HE BENT CLOSER TO ME
HAS JUST TERMED IT FETISHISM
TEN DAYS OF A RELIGIOUS ARGUMENT THREE TIMES A DAY WOULD BE INTOLERABLE BUT THE CHEERFUL VENZA WOULD HELP SHE NEVER EATS THE MIDDAY MEAL SAID SNAP SHE'S ON THE DECK HAVING ORANGE JUICE I GUESS IT'S THE OLD GAG ABOUT DIET EH
THE GIRL WAS ABOUT MY OWN HEIGHT THAT IS SIX FEET TWO INCHES THE MAN WAS SEVEN FEET OR MORE BOTH WORE THE MARTIAN OUTER ROBE THE GIRL FLUNG HERS BACK HER LIMBS WERE ENCASED IN PSEUDOMAIL
DON'T BE SILLY VENZA I ENJOYED HER I GAZED AT HER SMALL SLIM FIGURE RECLINING IN THE DECK CHAIR HER LONG GRAY ROBE PARTED BY DESIGN I HAVE NO DOUBT TO DISPLAY HER SHAPELY SATIN SHEATHED LEGS
HER BLACK HAIR WAS COILED IN A HEAVY KNOT AT THE BACK OF HER NECK HER CARMINE LIPS WERE PARTED WITH A MOCKING ALLURING SMILE THE EXOTIC PERFUME OF HER ENVELOPED ME SHE GLANCED AT ME SIDEWISE FROM BENEATH HER SWEEPING BLACK LASHES
IF HE'S A PROFESSIONAL ENTERTAINER I'M A MOTOR OILER IT STARTLED ME WHY DO YOU SAY THAT INSTINCTIVELY MY GAZE SWEPT THE DECK AN EARTH WOMAN AND CHILD
SHE STARED AT ME I HAD NOT ANSWERED HER GRIN MY MIND WAS TOO BUSY WITH QUEER FANCIES HALSEY'S WORDS THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM WERE THESE PASSENGERS MASQUERADERS WERE THEY PUT HERE BY GEORGE PRINCE
I PARRIED I MEAN A LOT OF THINGS WHAT WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT WAS THE EXCITEMENT YOU WERE IN JUST BEFORE BREAKFAST THIS MORNING EXCITEMENT GREGG YOU MAY TRUST ME FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE WAS WHOLLY SERIOUS
SHAC'S CURRENT WAS INTERRUPTED TELL HIM TO TRY IT AGAIN VENZA I'LL TALK WITH HIM NO I'D BETTER LET HIM ALONE CAN YOU GET HIM TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT
SHE TURNED SOLEMN YOU MAY BE INTERESTED TO KNOW SHE LOVES YOU I COULD SEE IT I KNEW IT WHEN I MENTIONED YOU TO HER THIS MORNING ME WHY WE'VE HARDLY SPOKEN IS IT NECESSARY
TELL BLACKSTONE WHAT'S HAPPENED BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED CARTER WAS GRIM AND WHITE
I'LL BE THERE PRESENTLY GREGG HE SLAMMED THE DOOR UPON ME I FOLLOWED HIS ORDERS BUT IT WAS LIKE A DREAM OF HORROR THE TURMOIL OF THE SHIP GRADUALLY QUIETED SNAP WENT TO THE RADIO ROOM
HAD OPENED ANITA'S CORRIDOR DOOR WASN'T IT SEALED YES BUT THE INTRUDER OPENED IT BURST IT
I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO GET AWAY I WOULD LIE DOWN FOR AN HOUR AND THEN GO TO ANITA'S STATEROOM I'D DEMAND THAT DOCTOR FRANK LET ME SEE HER I WENT TO THE STERN DECK WHERE MY CUBBY WAS LOCATED MY MIND WAS
WAS EMPTY BUT I LEAPED AND STRUCK A SOLID BODY CROUCHING IN THE DOORWAY A GIANT MAN
SAVAGE ENCOUNTER HE STRUCK THE WEAPON FROM MY HAND HE HAD DROPPED HIS HYDROGEN TORCH AND TRIED TO GRIP ME BUT I TWISTED AWAY FROM HIS HOLD SO IT'S YOU QUIET GREGG HALJAN I ONLY WANT TO TALK WITHOUT WARNING A STAB OF RADIANCE SHOT FROM A WEAPON IN HIS HAND
SHE TOLD US BEFORE SHE DIED DIED I LEAPED TO MY FEET SHE DIED YES GREGG AN HOUR AGO
IT IS RATHER TO BE SET DOWN TO HIS CREDIT THAT HIS FEELINGS ON THE SUBJECT WERE ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED AND IN CONSIDERING THE RELATION OF MEANS TO ENDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERE FOLLY TO HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THE EXCEPTIONAL AND IDYLLIC
SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD TO A SINGLE LIFE BUT PROMOTIONS HAVE SOMETIMES TO BE TAKEN WITH BITTER HERBS A PEERAGE WILL NOT QUITE DO INSTEAD OF LEADERSHIP TO THE MAN WHO MEANT TO LEAD AND THIS DELICATE LIMBED SYLPH OF TWENTY MEANT TO LEAD
FOR SUCH PASSIONS DWELL IN FEMININE BREASTS ALSO IN GWENDOLEN'S HOWEVER THEY DWELT AMONG STRICTLY FEMININE FURNITURE AND HAD NO DISTURBING REFERENCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING OR THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
AND WHEN TO ALL THESE QUALIFICATIONS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE WE ADD THE SPONTANEOUS SENSE OF CAPABILITY SOME HAPPY PERSONS ARE BORN WITH SO THAT ANY SUBJECT THEY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO IMPRESSES THEM WITH THEIR OWN POWER OF FORMING A CORRECT JUDGMENT ON IT
WHO CAN WONDER IF GWENDOLEN FELT READY TO MANAGE HER OWN DESTINY THERE WERE MANY SUBJECTS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS THE MAJORITY IN WHICH SHE FELT NO INTEREST BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID
THERE SEEMED TO BE A SUDDEN SUFFICIENT REASON FOR KEEPING UP THE FORMS OF LIFE AND EVEN THE WAITERS AT HOTELS SHOWED THE MORE ALACRITY IN DOING AWAY WITH CRUMBS AND CREASES AND DREGS WITH STRUGGLING FLIES IN THEM
THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
AND GRANDCOURT KEPT SO MANY DOGS THAT HE WAS REPUTED TO LOVE THEM AT ANY RATE HIS IMPULSE TO ACT JUST IN THAT WAY STARTED FROM SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BUT WHEN THE AMUSING ANGUISH BURST FORTH IN A HOWLING BARK
THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE THIS QUESTION CARRIED A STRONG SNEER I AM GOING TO MARRY HER YOU HAVE MADE HER AN OFFER ALREADY THEN NO SHE IS A YOUNG LADY WITH A WILL OF HER OWN I FANCY
CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS
I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME
AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS
NO CONDITIONS BEING ATTACHED TO THIS APPOINTMENT IT SEEMED A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SO FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MOMENT SOME OF THE IMPLICITS WHICH I BELIEVE TO UNDERLIE HUMAN EFFORT
THE RELATION IN WHICH INSTITUTIONAL RELIGION DOES OR SHOULD STAND TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE IS ALSO IN PART A MATTER FOR PSYCHOLOGY WHICH IS HERE CALLED UPON TO DEAL WITH THE RELIGIOUS ASPECT OF THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
AND TO INDICATE SOME OF THE RESULTS WHICH MIGHT FOLLOW UPON ITS HEALTHY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO POINT OUT THAT EACH OF THESE SUBJECTS NEEDS AT LEAST A VOLUME TO ITSELF
WARM GRATITUDE FIRST TO THE PRINCIPAL AND AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE WHO GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY OF DELIVERING THESE CHAPTERS IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND WHOSE UNFAILING SYMPATHY AND KINDNESS SO GREATLY HELPED ME
WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES MISTER HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
MISSUS HALE IF SHE SPOKE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED WITH A READY MADE LIST
THE PLACE AND THE LIFE SHE HAD LONGED FOR FOR YEARS AT THAT TIME OF ALL TIMES FOR YEARNING AND LONGING JUST BEFORE THE SHARP SENSES LOSE THEIR OUTLINES IN SLEEP
I AM SO GLAD I AM GOING HOME TO BE AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM AND MAMMA SHE WAS READY WITH A BRIGHT SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF FATIGUE TO GREET HER FATHER WHEN HE AWAKENED HE SMILED BACK AGAIN BUT
AND MARGARET WOULD TRY TO TEMPT HER FORTH ON TO THE BEAUTIFUL BROAD UPLAND SUN STREAKED CLOUD SHADOWED COMMON FOR SHE WAS SURE THAT HER MOTHER HAD ACCUSTOMED HERSELF TOO MUCH TO AN IN DOORS LIFE SELDOM EXTENDING HER WALKS BEYOND THE CHURCH
NOT SO PLEASANT IN THE LATTER HALF OF SEPTEMBER THE AUTUMNAL RAINS AND STORMS CAME ON AND MARGARET WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN MORE IN THE HOUSE THAN SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE
HE FOUND THAT THE INTERRUPTIONS WHICH AROSE OUT OF THESE DUTIES WERE REGARDED AS HARDSHIPS BY HIS WIFE NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF HIS PROFESSION BUT TO BE REGRETTED AND STRUGGLED AGAINST BY HER AS THEY SEVERALLY AROSE
SO HE WITHDREW WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE YET YOUNG INTO HIS LIBRARY TO SPEND HIS EVENINGS IF HE WERE AT HOME IN READING THE SPECULATIVE AND METAPHYSICAL BOOKS WHICH WERE HIS DELIGHT
ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
THE FULL ACCOUNT OF WHICH MARGARET HAD NEVER HEARD AND WHICH NOW SEEMED DOOMED TO BE BURIED IN SAD OBLIVION
WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER HER FATHER SEEMED THE BEST PERSON TO APPLY TO FOR INFORMATION AND WHEN WITH HIM
HIS ROOM WAS KEPT EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT IT AND WAS REGULARLY DUSTED AND PUT INTO ORDER BY DIXON MISSUS HALE'S MAID WHO TOUCHED NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK
ALIAS HER MARRIED LIFE SHE REMAINED WITH HER AND WAS DEVOTED TO HER INTERESTS ALWAYS CONSIDERING HERSELF AS THE GOOD AND PROTECTING FAIRY WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO BAFFLE THE MALIGNANT GIANT MISTER HALE
NOT ABSOLUTELY BASED ON A KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS IS EASILY BANISHED FOR A TIME BY A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY OR SOME HAPPY OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHEN THE BRILLIANT FOURTEEN FINE DAYS OF OCTOBER CAME ON
BEFORE WINTER FAIRLY SET IN ACCORDINGLY SHE WAS BUSY PREPARING HER BOARD ONE MORNING WHEN SARAH THE HOUSEMAID THREW WIDE OPEN THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND ANNOUNCED
MISTER THORNTON HAD HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN WORKING UP HIS MOTHER TO THE DESIRED POINT OF CIVILITY SHE DID NOT OFTEN MAKE CALLS AND WHEN SHE DID IT WAS IN HEAVY STATE THAT SHE WENT THROUGH HER DUTIES
BUT SHE REFUSED TO LET HIM KEEP HORSES FOR IT THEY WERE HIRED FOR THE SOLEMN OCCASIONS WHEN SHE PAID MORNING OR EVENING VISITS SHE HAD HAD HORSES FOR THREE DAYS NOT A FORTNIGHT BEFORE
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE OUT IN A CAB YOU CAME HOME WITH A HEADACHE FROM THE JOLTING I NEVER COMPLAINED OF IT I'M SURE NO
IT WILL DO YOU GOOD INSTEAD OF HARM
HE WENT ABRUPTLY OUT OF THE ROOM AFTER SAYING THIS IF HE HAD STAID A MINUTE LONGER FANNY WOULD HAVE CRIED AT HIS TONE OF COMMAND EVEN WHEN HE USED THE WORDS YOU WILL OBLIGE ME
AS DINNER GIVING AND AS CRITICISING OTHER PEOPLE'S DINNERS SHE TOOK SATISFACTION IN IT BUT THIS GOING TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH STRANGERS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING
MISSUS HALE WAS MAKING RATHER MORE EXERTION IN HER ANSWERS CAPTIVATED BY SOME REAL OLD LACE WHICH MISSUS THORNTON WORE LACE AS SHE AFTERWARDS OBSERVED TO DIXON OF THAT OLD ENGLISH POINT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MADE FOR THIS SEVENTY YEARS AND
WHICH CANNOT BE BOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN HEIR LOOM AND SHOWS THAT SHE HAD ANCESTORS SO THE OWNER OF THE ANCESTRAL LACE BECAME WORTHY OF SOMETHING MORE THAN THE LANGUID EXERTION TO BE AGREEABLE TO A VISITOR
FIFTEEN SHILLINGS A WEEK AND THREE SAVED OUT OF THEM THOUGHT MARGARET TO HERSELF BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY YOUNG SHE PROBABLY HAS FORGOTTEN HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT SHE MUST KNOW OF THOSE DAYS
HE HAD THUS HAD WITH HER SEVERAL BEWILDERING MOMENTS BEWILDERING BY REASON FAIRLY OF THEIR TACIT INVITATION TO HIM TO BE SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLE THIS WAS EXACTLY GOODNESS KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO BE
BUT HE HAD NEVER HAD IT SO LARGELY AND FREELY SO SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLY FOR THAT MATTER IMPUTED TO HIM AS OF EASY ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS A PARTICULAR IN WHICH AUNT MAUD APPEARED TO OFFER HERSELF AS AN EXAMPLE APPEARED TO SAY QUITE AGREEABLY
WHAT I WANT OF YOU DON'T YOU SEE IS TO BE JUST EXACTLY AS I AM THE QUANTITY OF THE ARTICLE REQUIRED WAS WHAT MIGHT ESPECIALLY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAGGER HE LIKED SO IN GENERAL THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH MISSUS LOWDER DEALT
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED AS WELL TO ASK HER HOW FEASIBLE SHE SUPPOSED IT FOR A POOR YOUNG MAN TO RESEMBLE HER AT ANY POINT BUT HE HAD AFTER ALL SOON ENOUGH PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS DOING AS SHE WISHED BY LETTING HIS WONDER SHOW
AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS
WHILE SCARCELY LESS PRODIGIOUS FOR THAT MATTER WAS HIS OWN READING ON THE SPOT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN HIS COMPANIONS A RELATION LIGHTED FOR HIM BY THE STRAIGHT LOOK NOT EXACTLY LOVING NOR LINGERING YET SEARCHING AND SOFT
THAT ON THE PART OF THEIR HOSTESS THE GIRL HAD TO RECKON WITH AS SHE ADVANCED IT TOOK HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND IN DOING SO IT TOLD A STORY THAT MADE POOR DENSHER AGAIN THE LEAST BIT SICK IT MARKED SO SOMETHING WITH WHICH KATE HABITUALLY
AND CONSUMMATELY RECKONED THAT WAS THE STORY THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS FOR HER BENEFICENT DRAGON UNDER ARMS LIVING UP EVERY HOUR BUT ESPECIALLY AT FESTAL HOURS TO THE VALUE MISSUS LOWDER HAD ATTACHED TO HER
THIS WAS WHY HIS APPRECIATION HAD TURNED FOR THE INSTANT TO FEAR HAD JUST TURNED AS WE HAVE SAID TO SICKNESS
THAT THE DISCIPLINED FACE DID OFFER HIM OVER THE FOOTLIGHTS AS HE BELIEVED THE SMALL GLEAM FINE FAINT BUT EXQUISITE OF A SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE SO MIGHT A PRACTISED PERFORMER EVEN WHEN RAKED BY DOUBLE BARRELLED GLASSES SEEM TO BE ALL IN HER PART
HER LITTLE DRY NEW ENGLAND BRIGHTNESS HE HAD SAMPLED ALL THE SHADES OF THE AMERICAN COMPLEXITY IF COMPLEXITY IT WERE HAD ITS ACTUAL REASONS FOR FINDING RELIEF MOST IN SILENCE
IT POINTED THE MORAL THAT BOSTON FOR THE FINER TASTE LEFT NEW YORK NOWHERE AND THE GOOD LADY AS THE EXPONENT OF THIS DOCTRINE WHICH SHE SET FORTH AT A CERTAIN LENGTH MADE OBVIOUSLY TO DENSHER'S MIND HER NEAREST APPROACH TO SUPPLYING
HE HADN'T PRETENDED HE DID BUT THERE WAS A PURITY OF REPROACH IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S FACE AND TONE A PURITY CHARGED APPARENTLY WITH SOLEMN MEANINGS SO THAT FOR A LITTLE SMALL AS HAD BEEN HIS CLAIM HE COULDN'T BUT FEEL THAT SHE EXAGGERATED
AS IF NOW TO KEEP WELL WITH HIM HE ASKED NOTHING BETTER SHE WAS OFF WITH YOU TO THESE PARTS BEFORE I KNEW IT I MYSELF WAS OFF TOO AWAY OFF TO WONDERFUL PARTS WHERE I HAD ENDLESSLY MORE TO SEE
AS OCEAN CURRENTS THE HUDDLED HERD HAD DRIFTED TO HER BLINDLY IT MIGHT AS BLINDLY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY
BUT THE GREAT REASON WAS PROBABLY THE ABSENCE AT THE MOMENT OF A LARGER LION THE BIGGER BEAST WOULD COME AND THE SMALLER WOULD THEN INCONTINENTLY VANISH IT WAS AT ALL EVENTS CHARACTERISTIC
AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO
THERE CAME ANOTHER IT MUST BE ADDED AND DOUBTLESS AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT OVER THE CLOTH DID HANG BETWEEN THEM WHEN SHE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING QUITE ANSWERED DEAR NO FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME
NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ONLY A POOR SILLY THOUGH QUITE HARMLESS IMITATION WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SAYING HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY MERGED IN WHAT SHE DID SAY FOR SHE CAME OVERTLY TO HIS AID VERY MUCH AS IF GUESSING SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS
BUT IT WAS THEY ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WHO HAD DEVELOPED HER SHE WAS ALWAYS A CHARMER ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER SEEN BUT SHE WASN'T THE PERSON HE HAD BACKED
THAT IT WAS TRUE WOULD BE WHAT SHE MUST REVEAL ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO HER LAST ENTRENCHMENTS AND WELL CORNERED IN HER PASSION THE RARE PASSION OF FRIENDSHIP THE SOLE PASSION OF HER LITTLE LIFE SAVE THE ONE OTHER MORE IMPERTURBABLY CEREBRAL
SHE SLIPPED IN THE OBSERVATION THAT HER MILLY WAS INCAPABLE OF CHANGE WAS JUST EXACTLY ON THE CONTRARY
CHOP ME UP FINE OR SERVE ME WHOLE IT WAS A WAY OF BEING GOT AT THAT KATE PROFESSED SHE DREADED IT WOULD BE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S HOWEVER SHE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE MISSUS STRINGHAM ODDLY FELT
SHAKESPEARE THE WHILE CHALK WAS A BULWARK BETWEEN US AND THE FOE AND THOUGH ONE OR TWO OF THEM LOOSED OFF THEIR MATCHLOCKS TRYING TO GET AT US SIDEWAYS THEY COULD NOT EVEN SEE THEIR QUARRY
I CANNOT STAND I SAID THERE IS SOMETHING GONE IN MY LEG AND I FEEL BLOOD RUNNING DOWN INTO MY BOOT HE KNELT AND ROLLED DOWN THE LEG OF MY STOCKING BUT THOUGH HE ONLY MOVED MY FOOT
JUST AT THE END OF THIS FLAT LEDGE FARTHEST FROM WHERE THE BRIDLE PATH LEADS DOWN BUT NOT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE WE STAND THERE IS A SHEEP TRACK LEADING UP THE CLIFF IT STARTS
WHERE THE UNDER CLIFF DIES BACK AGAIN INTO THE CHALK FACE AND CLIMBS BY SLANTS AND ELBOW TURNS UP TO THE TOP THE SHEPHERDS CALL IT THE ZIGZAG AND EVEN SHEEP LOSE THEIR FOOTING ON IT AND OF MEN
AND A THREAD OF BLOOD THAT WELLED UP FROM IT AND TRICKLED OFF ON TO THE SWARD IT WAS A SIGHT TO STAGGER ANY MAN AND WOULD HAVE MADE ME SWOON PERHAPS BUT THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR WE WERE AT THE END OF THE UNDER CLIFF
AND TWAS A TASK THAT MIGHT COW THE BRAVEST AND WHEN I LOOKED UPON THE ZIGZAG IT SEEMED BETTER TO STAY WHERE WE WERE AND FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE POSSE THAN SET FOOT ON THAT AWFUL WAY AND FALL UPON THE ROCKS BELOW
WE HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES YET TO WIN OR LOSE WITH AND IF WE GAIN THE CLIFF TOP IN THAT TIME WE SHALL HAVE AN HOUR'S START OR MORE FOR THEY WILL TAKE ALL THAT TO SEARCH THE UNDER CLIFF AND MASKEW TOO
THUS HE WENT ON FOR A TIME THAT SEEMED WITHOUT END AND YET WAS REALLY BUT A MINUTE OR TWO AND BY DEGREES I FELT THE WIND THAT WE COULD SCARCE PERCEIVE AT ALL ON THE UNDER CLIFF BLOW FRESHER AND COLD ON THE CLIFF SIDE
THE PATH IS TOO NARROW HERE FOR ME TO CARRY THEE AND THOU MUST CREEP ROUND THIS CORNER ON THY HANDS AND KNEES BUT HAVE A CARE TO KEEP THY OUTER HAND NEAR TO THE INNER AND THE BALANCE OF THY BODY TO THE CLIFF
FELT A SICKENING QUALM AND SWIMMING OF THE BRAIN AND KNEW THAT I WAS GIDDY AND MUST FALL THEN I CALLED OUT TO ELZEVIR AND HE GUESSING WHAT HAD COME OVER ME CRIES TO TURN UPON MY SIDE AND PRESS MY BELLY TO THE CLIFF
LIKE SITTING GUILLEMOTS AGAINST THE CLIFF FACE SO HE TALKED TO HIMSELF AND ALL THE WHILE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN A WORLD TO PLUCK UP HEART AND CREEP ON FARTHER YET COULD NOT FOR THE DEADLY SWEATING FEAR THAT HAD HOLD OF ME
THE DAY WAS STILL YOUNG AND FAR BELOW US WAS STRETCHED THE MOVING FLOOR OF THE CHANNEL WITH A SILVER GREY FILM OF NIGHT MISTS NOT YET LIFTED IN THE OFFING A HUMMOCKY UP AND DOWN LINE OF CLIFFS
WITH THE STRAIGHT SUNPATH ACROSS IT SPANGLED AND GLEAMING LIKE A MACKEREL'S BACK THE RELIEF OF BEING ONCE MORE ON FIRM GROUND AND THE EXULTATION OF AN ESCAPE FROM IMMEDIATE DANGER REMOVED MY PAIN AND MADE ME FORGET THAT MY LEG WAS BROKEN
AND THE WIND WHICH A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THREATENED TO BLOW ME FROM THAT NARROW LEDGE SEEMED NOW BUT THE GENTLEST OF BREEZES FRESH WITH THE BREATH OF THE KINDLY SEA BUT THIS WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT FOR THE ANGUISH CAME BACK AND GREW APACE
THERE CAME BEFORE MY EYES THAT GREY FACE TURNED UP AGAINST THE MORNING SUN AND I THOUGHT OF ALL IT MEANT FOR GRACE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY OWN LIFE TO CALL BACK THAT OF OUR WORST ENEMY THEN ELZEVIR SAT UP STRETCHING HIMSELF LIKE ONE WAKING OUT OF SLEEP
AND SO HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AGAIN AND STARTED OFF ACROSS THE FIELDS I NEED NOT TELL OF THAT WEARY JOURNEY AND INDEED COULD NOT IF I WISHED FOR THE PAIN WENT TO MY HEAD AND FILLED ME WITH SUCH A DROWSY ANGUISH
THAT I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT WHEN SOME UNLOOKED FOR MOVEMENT GAVE ME A SHARPER TWINGE AND MADE ME CRY OUT AT FIRST ELZEVIR WALKED BRISKLY BUT AS THE DAY WORE ON WENT SLOWER
AND IF THEY COME I CANNOT HELP IT FOR WEARINESS AND THE SUN'S HEAT HAVE MADE MY FEET LIKE LEAD A SCORE OF YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT SUCH A TASK BUT NOW TIS DIFFERENT
BUT ELZEVIR PASSED HIM THE TIME OF DAY IN A CIVIL VOICE AND HE STOPPED AND GAVE IT BACK WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SON BLOCK ASKED SCARING ROOKS FOR FARMER TOPP WAS THE ANSWER
ALTHOUGH I KNEW LITTLE OF THESE QUARRIES AND CERTAINLY WAS IN EVIL PLIGHT TO TAKE NOTE OF ANYTHING AT THAT TIME YET AFTERWARDS I LEARNT MUCH ABOUT THEM OUT OF SUCH EXCAVATIONS COMES THAT BLACK PURBECK MARBLE WHICH YOU SEE IN OLD CHURCHES IN OUR COUNTRY
FROM THE BOTTOM OF THIS SHAFT THERE SPREAD OUT NARROW PASSAGES OR TUNNELS MOSTLY SIX FEET HIGH BUT SOMETIMES ONLY THREE OR FOUR AND IN THESE THE MARBLE IS DUG THESE QUARRIES WERE MADE BY MEN CENTURIES AGO SOME SAY BY THE ROMANS THEMSELVES
ON WHICH THE MARBLE BLOCKS WERE ONCE HAULED UP BY WOODEN WINCHES DOWN THESE STEPS NO FEET EVER WALKED NOW FOR NOT ONLY WERE SUFFOCATING GASES SAID TO BESET THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFTS
THERE HE SAID THIS IS JOSEPH'S PIT AND HERE WE MUST LIE HID UNTIL THY FOOT IS SOUND AGAIN ONCE GET TO THE BOTTOM SAFE AND WE CAN LAUGH AT POSSE AND HUE AND CRY
AND WALKED ON AS IF HE KNEW THE WAY I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT PERCEIVED THAT WE WERE PASSING THROUGH ENDLESS GALLERIES CUT IN THE SOLID ROCK HIGH ENOUGH FOR THE MOST PART TO ALLOW OF WALKING UPRIGHT BUT SOMETIMES SO LOW AS TO FORCE HIM TO BEND DOWN
AND CARRY ME IN A VERY CONSTRAINED ATTITUDE ONLY TWICE DID HE SET ME DOWN AT A TURNING WHILE HE TOOK OUT HIS TINDER BOX AND LIT A MATCH
WHO TRUSTING TOO MUCH IN THEIR HOPEFUL TIME LIVE BUT A WHILE AND PERISH IN THEIR PRIME NEITHER SHALL ANY WHO THIS COURSE SHALL RUN LEAVE OFF THE RACE WHICH HE HATH ONCE BEGUN
THE VERIEST LOUT OF ALL SHALL BE THEIR JUDGE O HORRIBLE AND DANGEROUS DELUGE DELUGE I CALL IT AND THAT FOR GOOD REASON FOR THIS SHALL BE OMITTED IN NO SEASON
SHALL CEASE TO DART UPON IT ANY LIGHT MORE THAN IN AN ECLIPSE OR IN THE NIGHT SO THAT AT ONCE ITS FAVOUR SHALL BE GONE AND LIBERTY WITH IT BE LEFT ALONE AND YET BEFORE IT COME TO RUIN THUS
AND YET BEFORE THAT THEY BE CLEAN DISPERST
TO SEE YOUR PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT COME THEY WILL COME IF I FIND THEM YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY OF MY PEOPLE THERE SAID TENAYA I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE MY TRIBE IS SMALL
BUT I AM NOW WILLING TO GO FOR IT IS BEST FOR MY PEOPLE PUSHING AHEAD TAKING TURNS IN BREAKING A WAY THROUGH THE SNOW THEY ARRIVED IN SIGHT OF THE GREAT VALLEY EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
AND GUIDED BY ONE OF TENAYA'S INDIANS DESCENDED BY THE SAME ROUTE AS THAT FOLLOWED BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL AND THE WEARY PARTY WENT INTO CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK OPPOSITE EL CAPITAN AFTER SUPPER SEATED AROUND A BIG FIRE
WHEN MISTER J M HUTCHINGS HAVING HEARD OF ITS WONDERFUL SCENERY COLLECTED A PARTY AND MADE THE FIRST REGULAR TOURIST'S VISIT TO THE YOSEMITE
DESCRIBED IT IN ARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY A GOOD ARTIST WHO WAS TAKEN INTO THE VALLEY BY HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS ERECTED IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AND WAS KEPT AS A HOTEL THE NEXT YEAR BY G A HITE AND LATER BY J H NEAL AND S M CUNNINGHAM
TO THE BORDER OF THE PARK EIGHT MILES BELOW THE VALLEY IT IS EIGHTY MILES LONG
TO US MANY OTHERS WHO WERE TRYING TO DO IT TOO FOR WE WERE SO DOMESTIC HE SO TERRIFYINGLY COSMOPOLITAN WHILE WE WERE BEING FUNNY AS PLANNED WITH COLLAR STUDS AND HOT WATER BOTTLES
OUR EFFORTS TO BE FUNNY IN THE SAKI MANNER HAVE NOT SURVIVED TO PROVE IT WHAT IS SAKI'S MANNER
LIKE EVERY ARTIST WORTH CONSIDERATION HE HAD NO RECIPE IF HIS EXOTIC CHOICE OF SUBJECT WAS OFTEN HIS STRENGTH IT WAS OFTEN HIS WEAKNESS
LET US TAKE A SAMPLE OR TWO OF SAKI NINETEEN ELEVEN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE DINNER HAD WORN OFF THE WINE LISTS HAD BEEN CONSULTED
IS THE WORD PRIVILEGE THE DESIGN WHEN FINALLY DEVELOPED WAS A SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT TO MONSIEUR DEPLIS WHO HAD SUSPECTED ICARUS OF BEING A FORTRESS
HE WROTE I AM WRITING YOU A LETTER
IT WAS BROUGHT SOME SAID FROM ITALY OTHERS FROM THE LEVANT AMONG SOME GOODS WHICH WERE BROUGHT HOME BY THEIR TURKEY FLEET OTHERS SAID IT WAS BROUGHT FROM CANDIA OTHERS FROM CYPRUS
AND FROM THEM WAS HANDED ABOUT BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY SO THAT THINGS DID NOT SPREAD INSTANTLY OVER THE WHOLE NATION AS THEY DO NOW BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD A TRUE ACCOUNT OF IT
OR RATHER AT THE UPPER END OF DRURY LANE
TWO PHYSICIANS AND A SURGEON WERE ORDERED TO GO TO THE HOUSE AND MAKE INSPECTION THIS THEY DID AND FINDING EVIDENT TOKENS OF THE SICKNESS UPON BOTH THE BODIES THAT WERE DEAD
IT BEGAN TO BE SUSPECTED THAT THE PLAGUE WAS AMONG THE PEOPLE AT THAT END OF THE TOWN AND THAT MANY HAD DIED OF IT THOUGH THEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO KEEP IT AS MUCH FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE
THE USUAL NUMBER OF BURIALS IN A WEEK IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES IN THE FIELDS AND SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN WERE FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN OR NINETEEN EACH FEW MORE OR LESS
IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE ORDINARY BURIALS INCREASED IN NUMBER CONSIDERABLY FOR EXAMPLE FROM DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH TO JANUARY THIRD
FROM THE BEGINNING OF APRIL ESPECIALLY THEY STOOD AT TWENTY FIVE EACH WEEK TILL THE WEEK FROM THE EIGHTEENTH TO THE TWENTY FIFTH
NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS ALREADY INFECTED THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF MAY YET THE WEATHER WAS TEMPERATE VARIABLE AND COOL ENOUGH AND PEOPLE HAD STILL SOME HOPES THAT WHICH ENCOURAGED THEM WAS THAT THE CITY WAS HEALTHY
UPON THE WHOLE THAT THERE WERE FIFTY DIED THAT WEEK OF THE PLAGUE THE NEXT BILL WAS FROM THE TWENTY THIRD OF MAY TO THE THIRTIETH WHEN THE NUMBER OF THE PLAGUE WAS SEVENTEEN BUT
A FRIGHTFUL NUMBER OF WHOM THEY SET DOWN BUT NINE OF THE PLAGUE BUT ON AN EXAMINATION MORE STRICTLY BY THE JUSTICES OF PEACE AND AT THE LORD MAYOR'S REQUEST
TWENTY MORE WHO WERE REALLY DEAD OF THE PLAGUE IN THAT PARISH BUT HAD BEEN SET DOWN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER OR OTHER DISTEMPERS BESIDES OTHERS CONCEALED
OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTINUED VERY EASY BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN THEIR CONSTERNATION WAS VERY GREAT AND THE RICHER SORT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY FROM THE WEST PART OF THE CITY
COACHES FILLED WITH PEOPLE OF THE BETTER SORT AND HORSEMEN ATTENDING THEM AND ALL HURRYING AWAY THEN EMPTY WAGGONS AND CARTS APPEARED AND SPARE HORSES WITH SERVANTS WHO IT WAS APPARENT
THIS HURRY OF THE PEOPLE WAS SUCH FOR SOME WEEKS THAT THERE WAS NO GETTING AT THE LORD MAYOR'S DOOR WITHOUT EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY THERE WERE SUCH PRESSING AND CROWDING THERE
THIS HURRY I SAY CONTINUED SOME WEEKS THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE MONTH OF MAY AND JUNE AND THE MORE BECAUSE IT WAS RUMOURED THAT AN ORDER OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE ISSUED OUT
TO PLACE TURNPIKES AND BARRIERS ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT PEOPLE TRAVELLING AND THAT THE TOWNS ON THE ROAD WOULD NOT SUFFER PEOPLE FROM LONDON TO PASS FOR FEAR OF BRINGING THE INFECTION ALONG WITH THEM
BUT I HAD A FAMILY OF SERVANTS WHOM I KEPT AT MY BUSINESS HAD A HOUSE SHOP AND WAREHOUSES FILLED WITH GOODS AND IN SHORT TO LEAVE THEM ALL AS THINGS IN SUCH A CASE MUST BE LEFT THAT IS TO SAY
BUT THEN MY SERVANT WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO TAKE DOWN WITH ME DECEIVED ME AND BEING FRIGHTED AT THE INCREASE OF THE DISTEMPER AND NOT KNOWING WHEN I SHOULD GO HE TOOK OTHER MEASURES AND LEFT ME
SO I WAS PUT OFF FOR THAT TIME AND ONE WAY OR OTHER I ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO APPOINT TO GO AWAY WAS ALWAYS CROSSED BY SOME ACCIDENT OR OTHER SO AS TO DISAPPOINT AND PUT IT OFF AGAIN
AND I BEGAN TO RESOLVE TO GO AND ACCORDINGLY MADE ALL THINGS READY FOR IN SHORT THE INFECTION INCREASED ROUND ME
AND IT WAS MEET HE SHOULD DO WITH ME AS SHOULD SEEM GOOD TO HIM WITH THIS RESOLUTION I WENT TO BED
SWEATED A LITTLE AND WAS MUCH REFRESHED THE APPREHENSIONS OF ITS BEING THE INFECTION WENT ALSO QUITE AWAY WITH MY ILLNESS AND I WENT ABOUT MY BUSINESS AS USUAL
WERE THEN PRACTISED IN THE TOWN AS OPENLY AS EVER I WILL NOT SAY QUITE AS FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE MANY WAYS LESSENED BUT THE CITY ITSELF BEGAN NOW TO BE VISITED TOO
BUT THEY WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT STREET NEITHER ON ONE SIDE
BECAUSE AS I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD NOT MINGLE WITH ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT OF HOUSES OR
AND I KNEW THAT MOTHER DID NOT WANT ME TO BE THERE EITHER HAD SHE NOT SENT ME AWAY TO SAVE ME AND ASKED GOD OUR HEAVENLY FATHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME
BUT ALSO OF HAVING WANTONLY TAKEN THE LIFE OF MISSUS MURPHY AND OF MY MOTHER SOME DECLARED HIM CRAZY OTHERS CALLED HIM A MONSTER KESEBERG DENIED THESE CHARGES AND
SHOULD BE HANDED OVER TO CAPTAIN FALLON TO SATISFY THE CLAIMS OF HIS PARTY AND THE OTHER HALF SHOULD BE PUT INTO THE HANDS OF A GUARDIAN
NOTWITHSTANDING THESE PLANS FOR OUR WELL BEING UNACCOUNTABLE DELAYS FOLLOWED MAKING OUR SITUATION DAILY MORE TRYING
FLOATING NEAR THE END OF THE BOARD AND LAY DOWN UPON IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CATCHING THEM
NOT A SOUL WAS IN SIGHT WHEN WE STARTED TOWARD THE FORT ALL UNCONSCIOUS OF WHAT THE INEVITABLE IS TO BE WAS WEAVING INTO OUR LIVES
I BEING THE SMALLEST CHILD WAS GIVEN THE SHORTEST STICK AND ALLOWED TO STAND NEAREST THE FIRE SOON THE THREE SLICES WERE SIZZLING AND BROWNING FROM THE ENDS OF THREE WILLOW RODS AND SMELLED SO GOOD THAT WE COULD HARDLY WAIT FOR THEM TO BE DONE
SHE AND HER HUSBAND SLIPPED AWAY SOON ON HORSEBACK AND WE WERE TOLD THAT WE WERE TO STAY AT OUR NEIGHBOR'S UNTIL THEY RETURNED FOR US
GRANDPA BROUGHT THE NEWS HOME CALIFORNIA IS OURS THERE WILL BE NO MORE WAR NO MORE TROUBLE AND NO MORE NEED OF SOLDIERS YET THE WOMEN FELT THAT THEIR BATTLES AND TRIALS HAD JUST BEGUN
BUT WE WERE NOT MUCH AFRAID WHEN IT WAS LIGHT ENOUGH SO THAT IMAGINATION COULD NOT PICTURE THEM CREEPING STEALTHILY BEHIND US OUR GALLANT COMPANY C OFFICERED BY CAPTAIN BARTLETT AND LIEUTENANTS STONEMAN AND STONE
TO THE GOOD WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND WHEN CAPTAIN JOE HOOKER BROUGHT HIM OUT TO VISIT GRANDMA'S DAIRY SHE TOO WAS GREATLY PLEASED BY HIS SOLDIERLY BEARING AFTER HE MENTIONED THAT HE HAD HEARD OF HER INTEREST IN THE COMPANY WHICH HAD BEEN CALLED AWAY
AND THAT HE BELIEVED SHE WOULD FIND COMPANY H EQUALLY DESERVING OF HER CONSIDERATION SHE READILY EXTENDED TO THE NEW MEN THE HOMELIKE PRIVILEGES WHICH THE OTHERS HAD ENJOYED THUS MORE FRIENDS CAME AMONG US
AND MUS TAKE YOS RIGHT IN TO DE GENERAL I HAD NEVER SEEN A GENERAL AND WAS SHY ABOUT MEETING ONE UNTIL AFTER SHE ASSURED ME THAT ONLY COWARDS AND BAD MEN FEARED HIM WE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR AND ENTERED A LARGE ROOM
SHE ANTICIPATED THE COMING EVENT WITH INTEREST AND PLEASURE BECAUSE THE PROLONGED AND BRILLIANT FESTIVITIES WOULD AFFORD HER AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISPLAY HER FANCY AND TALENT IN BUTTER MODELLING FOR THE WORK SHE DID NOT CHARGE
THE GREAT EMPEROR ASKS TO SEE THEE AND THOU MUST COME SHE TOLD HOW POOR RED FACED BEWILDERED MARIE DROPPED HER LADLE AND STARED AT THE SPEAKER
THEN ROLLED DOWN HER SLEEVES WHILE THE FRAU WIRTHIN TIED HER OWN BEST WHITE APRON AROUND HER WAIST AT THE SAME TIME INSTRUCTING HER IN THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE MUST HOLD HER DRESS AT THE SIDES BETWEEN THUMB AND FOREFINGER AND SPREAD THE SKIRT WIDE
YET AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER SHE WAS INFORMED THAT THE EMPEROR AND EMPRESS HAD SPOKEN KINDLY TO HER AND THAT SHE HERSELF HAD MADE HER BOW AND BACKED OUT OF THE ROOM ADMIRABLY FOR ONE IN HER POSITION
SENORA VALLEJO TOOK ME BY THE HAND SAYING IN HER OWN MUSICAL TONGUE COME LITTLE DAUGHTER AND PLAY WHILE YOU WAIT SHE LED ME TO A ROOM THAT HAD PICTURES ON THE WALLS AND LEFT ME SURROUNDED BY TOYS BUT I COULD NOT PLAY
THE LINEN PILLOW SLIPS WERE AS FINE AS THOSE SENORITA ISABELLA FITCH SHOWED ME WHEN SHE GAVE ME THE FEW HIGHLY PRIZED LESSONS IN SIMPLE DRAWN WORK AND HER COUSIN SENORITA LEESE HAD TAUGHT ME HEMMING
THEIR PEOPLE NEVER ASKED UNFEELING QUESTIONS NOR REPEATED HARROWING TALES AND I DID NOT LEARN UNTIL I WAS GROWN THAT THEY HAD BEEN AMONG THE LARGE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FUND FOR THE RELIEF OF OUR PARTY
WHILE I CUT THEM OFF AND HOED UP THE ROOTS THE PLANTS TOWERED LUXURIANTLY ABOVE OUR HEADS MAKING THE TASK EXTREMELY PAINFUL
ONE DAY AS I WAS RETURNING FROM IT WITH MY EMPTY PAIL A TIDY BLACK EYED WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID I'M A CHEROKEE INDIAN THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE THREE DROVERS THAT SOLD THE BRUNNERS THEM LONG HORNED CATTLE THAT WAS DELIVERED THE OTHER DAY
WHERE THE EXPEDITION SHOULD LAND TO APPOINT OFFICERS TO SUPERINTEND THE LEVYING OF TROOPS TO DOLE OUT PROVISIONS AND AMMUNITION ALL THAT WAS LEFT TO THE GENERAL WAS TO DIRECT THE EVOLUTIONS OF THE ARMY IN THE FIELD
SHOULD ACCOMPANY ARGYLE TO SCOTLAND AND THAT FLETCHER SHOULD GO WITH MONMOUTH TO ENGLAND FLETCHER FROM THE BEGINNING HAD AUGURED ILL OF THE ENTERPRISE BUT HIS CHIVALROUS SPIRIT WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM TO DECLINE A RISK WHICH HIS FRIENDS SEEMED EAGER TO ENCOUNTER
WHEN GREY REPEATED WITH APPROBATION WHAT WILDMAN HAD SAID ABOUT RICHMOND AND RICHARD THE WELL READ AND THOUGHTFUL SCOT JUSTLY REMARKED THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND THE SEVENTEENTH
RICHMOND WAS ASSURED OF THE SUPPORT OF BARONS EACH OF WHOM COULD BRING AN ARMY OF FEUDAL RETAINERS INTO THE FIELD
BEEN SUCH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO LITTLE PURPOSE TO BRING HIM EVEN BEFORE THE CORRUPT AND PARTIAL TRIBUNALS OF THAT AGE IN ONE POINT HOWEVER HE WAS VULNERABLE HE WAS A STUDENT OF CHRIST CHURCH IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD
BUT THIS WAS NOT EASY LOCKE HAD AT OXFORD ABSTAINED FROM EXPRESSING ANY OPINION ON THE POLITICS OF THE DAY SPIES HAD BEEN SET ABOUT HIM DOCTORS OF DIVINITY AND MASTERS OF ARTS
THE INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED WOULD HAVE EXCUSED HIM IF HE HAD RESORTED TO VIOLENT METHODS OF REDRESS BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE BLINDED BY PERSONAL RESENTMENT HE AUGURED NO GOOD FROM THE SCHEMES
THE KING SAID THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM UNQUESTIONABLE SOURCES INTELLIGENCE OF DESIGNS WHICH WERE FORMING AGAINST THE THRONE BY HIS BANISHED SUBJECTS IN HOLLAND SOME OF THE EXILES WERE CUTTHROATS
THERE WAS THEREFORE AT THE HAGUE AN EXTREME ANXIETY TO AVOID ALL THAT COULD GIVE HIM OFFENCE THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF WILLIAM WAS ALSO ON THIS OCCASION IDENTICAL WITH THE INTEREST OF HIS FATHER IN LAW
THEN INSTEAD OF APPLYING AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE TO THE STATES GENERAL WHO SATE CLOSE TO HIS OWN DOOR
WITH A REQUEST THAT THE SUSPECTED SHIPS MIGHT BE DETAINED THE MAGISTRATES OF AMSTERDAM ANSWERED THAT THE ENTRANCE OF THE ZUYDER ZEE WAS OUT OF THEIR JURISDICTION AND REFERRED HIM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT THIS WAS A MERE EXCUSE
DEPARTED FROM THE COURSE WHICH THEY ORDINARILY OBSERVED IN THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH HE MADE HIS APPLICATION TO THEM AN ORDER DRAWN IN EXACT CONFORMITY WITH HIS REQUEST
WOULD IN A MOMENT HAVE PUT AN END TO HIS EXPEDITION ROUND HIS LITTLE FLEET A BOAT WAS ROWING IN WHICH WERE SOME PERSONS WITH TELESCOPES WHOM HE SUSPECTED TO BE SPIES BUT NO EFFECTUAL STEP WAS TAKEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETAINING HIM
HERE THE EARL PUBLISHED A MANIFESTO DRAWN UP IN HOLLAND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMITTEE BY JAMES STEWART A SCOTCH ADVOCATE WHOSE PEN WAS A FEW MONTHS LATER EMPLOYED IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY
NABUCHODONOSOR THE KING CALLED HOLOFERNES
WITH THE CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN AND ARCHERS
AND PILLAGED ALL THE CHILDREN OF THARSIS
JUDITH CHAPTER THREE
AND THEY HUMBLED THEIR SOULS IN FASTINGS AND PRAYERS
KNOW YE THAT THE LORD WILL HEAR YOUR PRAYERS
JUDITH CHAPTER FIVE
IN WHICH NEVER MAN COULD DWELL
FROM THE DIFFERENT PLACES WHEREIN THEY WERE SCATTERED THEY ARE COME TOGETHER
IF THERE BE ANY INIQUITY OF THEIRS IN THE SIGHT OF THEIR GOD LET US GO UP TO THEM BECAUSE THEIR GOD WILL SURELY DELIVER THEM TO THEE
WE CANNOT RESIST THEM BECAUSE THEIR GOD WILL DEFEND THEM
AND HIS ARMIES MEN UNARMED AND WITHOUT FORCE
WHEN THEY HAD LEFT OFF SPEAKING THAT HOLOFERNES BEING IN A VIOLENT PASSION
THAT THE NATION OF ISRAEL IS DEFENDED BY THEIR GOD
THEN THOU ALSO SHALT DIE WITH THEM BY THE SWORD OF THE ASSYRIANS
AND THEN THE SWORD OF MY SOLDIERS SHALL PASS THROUGH THY SIDES AND THOU SHALT BE STABBED AND FALL AMONG THE WOUNDED OF ISRAEL
AND SO LEFT HIM BOUND WITH ROPES
AND SETTING HIM IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE ASKED HIM
ALL THE PEOPLE FELL UPON THEIR FACES ADORING THE LORD AND ALL OF THEM TOGETHER MOURNING AND WEEPING
AFTER THE ASSEMBLY WAS BROKEN UP RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOUSE
ONLY SOME GOVERNMENT COULD OWN SUCH AN ENGINE OF DESTRUCTION AND IN THESE DISASTER FILLED TIMES WHEN MEN TAX THEIR INGENUITY TO BUILD INCREASINGLY POWERFUL AGGRESSIVE WEAPONS IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT UNKNOWN TO THE REST OF THE WORLD SOME NATION COULD HAVE BEEN TESTING SUCH A FEARSOME MACHINE
AND THE TORPEDO HAS LED TO THIS UNDERWATER BATTERING RAM WHICH IN TURN WILL LEAD TO THE WORLD PUTTING ITS FOOT DOWN AT LEAST I HOPE IT WILL BUT THIS HYPOTHESIS OF A WAR MACHINE COLLAPSED IN THE FACE OF FORMAL DENIALS FROM THE VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS
SO AFTER INQUIRIES CONDUCTED IN ENGLAND FRANCE RUSSIA PRUSSIA SPAIN ITALY AMERICA AND EVEN TURKEY THE HYPOTHESIS OF AN UNDERWATER MONITOR WAS ULTIMATELY REJECTED AND SO THE MONSTER SURFACED AGAIN
THEREFORE I WROTE AFTER EXAMINING THESE DIFFERENT HYPOTHESES ONE BY ONE WE ARE FORCED EVERY OTHER SUPPOSITION HAVING BEEN REFUTED TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL MARINE ANIMAL
WHAT IS THE CONSTITUTION OF THESE ANIMALS IT'S ALMOST BEYOND CONJECTURE HOWEVER THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM SUBMITTED TO ME CAN TAKE THE FORM OF A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO ALTERNATIVES EITHER WE KNOW EVERY VARIETY OF CREATURE POPULATING OUR PLANET OR WE DO NOT
INCREASE ITS DIMENSIONS FIVEFOLD OR EVEN TENFOLD THEN GIVE THIS CETACEAN A STRENGTH IN PROPORTION TO ITS SIZE WHILE ENLARGING ITS OFFENSIVE WEAPONS AND YOU HAVE THE ANIMAL WE'RE LOOKING FOR IT WOULD HAVE THE PROPORTIONS DETERMINED BY THE OFFICERS OF THE SHANNON
I HAD LEFT MYSELF A LOOPHOLE YET DEEP DOWN I HAD ACCEPTED THE EXISTENCE OF THE MONSTER MY ARTICLE WAS HOTLY DEBATED CAUSING A FINE OLD UPROAR
CONTINUOUS ALTERATION COULDN'T THE HEART OF THE OCEAN HIDE THE LAST REMAINING VARIETIES OF THESE TITANIC SPECIES FOR WHOM YEARS ARE CENTURIES AND CENTURIES MILLENNIA BUT I MUSTN'T LET THESE FANTASIES RUN AWAY WITH ME
UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE LADDER OF BRANCHES GROUPS CLASSES SUBCLASSES ORDERS FAMILIES GENERA SUBGENERA SPECIES AND VARIETIES BUT THERE HIS SCIENCE CAME TO A HALT CLASSIFYING WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM SO HE KNEW NOTHING ELSE
AS MASTER THINKS BEST CONSEIL REPLIED PLACIDLY YOU SEE MY FRIEND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE MONSTER THE NOTORIOUS NARWHALE WE'RE GOING TO RID THE SEAS OF IT THE AUTHOR OF A TWO VOLUME WORK IN QUARTO ON THE MYSTERIES OF THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS
IT'S A GLORIOUS MISSION BUT ALSO A DANGEROUS ONE
THE FRIGATE WOULD HAVE GONE WITHOUT ME AND I WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON THIS UNEARTHLY EXTRAORDINARY AND INCONCEIVABLE EXPEDITION WHOSE TRUE STORY MIGHT WELL MEET WITH SOME SKEPTICISM BUT COMMANDER FARRAGUT DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE A SINGLE DAY
THOUSANDS OF HANDKERCHIEFS WERE WAVING ABOVE THESE TIGHTLY PACKED MASSES HAILING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN UNTIL IT REACHED THE WATERS OF THE HUDSON RIVER AT THE TIP OF THE LONG PENINSULA THAT FORMS NEW YORK CITY
ANXIOUS TO SEE NED LAND AT WORK COMMANDER FARRAGUT AUTHORIZED HIM TO MAKE HIS WAY ABOARD THE MONROE AND THE CANADIAN HAD SUCH GOOD LUCK THAT WITH A RIGHT AND LEFT SHOT HE HARPOONED NOT ONE WHALE BUT TWO STRIKING THE FIRST STRAIGHT TO THE HEART AND CATCHING THE OTHER AFTER A FEW MINUTES CHASE
ASSUREDLY IF THE MONSTER EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH NED LAND'S HARPOON I WOULDN'T BET ON THE MONSTER THE FRIGATE SAILED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED BY JULY THIRD WE WERE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN ABREAST OF CABO DE LAS VIRGENES
AND MANEUVERED INSTEAD TO DOUBLE CAPE HORN THE CREW SIDED WITH HIM UNANIMOUSLY INDEED WERE WE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER THE NARWHALE IN SUCH A CRAMPED STRAIT MANY OF OUR SAILORS SWORE THAT THE MONSTER COULDN'T NEGOTIATE THIS PASSAGEWAY SIMPLY BECAUSE HE'S TOO BIG FOR IT
OUR COURSE WAS SET FOR THE NORTHWEST AND THE NEXT DAY OUR FRIGATE'S PROPELLER FINALLY CHURNED THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC OPEN YOUR EYES OPEN YOUR EYES REPEATED THE SAILORS OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THEY OPENED AMAZINGLY WIDE EYES AND SPYGLASSES
NO DOUBT OUR BOSUN SAID BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH WATER FOR HIM
EACH MAN WANTED ONE LAST LOOK WITH WHICH TO SUM UP HIS EXPERIENCE SPYGLASSES FUNCTIONED WITH FEVERISH ENERGY A SUPREME CHALLENGE HAD BEEN ISSUED TO THE GIANT NARWHALE AND THE LATTER HAD NO ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE FOR IGNORING THIS SUMMONS TO APPEAR
HOW TRUE WHEN ONE HAS THE HONOR OF BEING AN EXPERT AS MASTER IS ONE MUSTN'T LAY HIMSELF OPEN TO CONSEIL DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO COMPLETE THE COMPLIMENT IN THE MIDST OF THE GENERAL SILENCE A VOICE BECAME AUDIBLE
AYE AYE MAN SAID BARTLE WITH A TONE OF SARCASTIC CONSOLATION YOU TALK THE RIGHT LANGUAGE FOR YOU WHEN MIKE HOLDSWORTH'S GOAT SAYS BA A A IT'S ALL RIGHT IT UD BE UNNATURAL FOR IT TO MAKE ANY OTHER NOISE
AND WISELY FELL BACK ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED IN A SINGLE EVENING WAS RENEWED IN THE CHURCHYARD BEFORE SERVICE THE NEXT DAY WITH THE FRESH INTEREST CONFERRED ON ALL NEWS WHEN THERE IS A FRESH PERSON TO HEAR IT
WHAT A FINE OLD KITCHEN THIS IS SAID MISTER DONNITHORNE LOOKING ROUND ADMIRINGLY HE ALWAYS SPOKE IN THE SAME DELIBERATE WELL CHISELLED POLITE WAY WHETHER HIS WORDS WERE SUGARY OR VENOMOUS
NOT YET I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY
SAID MISTER POYSER WITH A GOOD NATURED BLANKNESS OF IMAGINATION AS TO THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT IF I'M CALLED UPON TO SPEAK SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER AFTER GLANCING AT HER HUSBAND WITH PITY AT HIS SOFTNESS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ME
NOT BUT WHAT I'M GLAD TO HEAR O ANYBODY RESPECTABLE COMING INTO THE PARISH THERE'S SOME
NOW THE PLAN I'M THINKING OF IS TO EFFECT A LITTLE EXCHANGE IF YOU WERE TO HAVE THE HOLLOW PASTURES YOU MIGHT INCREASE YOUR DAIRY WHICH MUST BE SO PROFITABLE UNDER YOUR WIFE'S MANAGEMENT AND I SHOULD REQUEST YOU MISSUS POYSER
THAN CORN LAND MISTER POYSER WAS LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIS MOUTH SCREWED UP
HE WOULD RATHER GIVE UP THAN HAVE A QUARREL ANY DAY AND AFTER ALL IT MATTERED MORE TO HIS WIFE THAN TO HIM SO AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE HE LOOKED UP AT HER AND SAID MILDLY WHAT DOST SAY
I KNOW THERE'S THEM AS IS BORN T OWN THE LAND AND THEM AS IS BORN TO SWEAT ON'T HERE MISSUS POYSER PAUSED TO GASP A LITTLE AND I KNOW IT'S CHRISTENED FOLKS'S DUTY TO SUBMIT TO THEIR BETTERS AS FUR AS FLESH AND
BLOOD ULL BEAR IT BUT I'LL NOT MAKE A MARTYR O MYSELF AND WEAR MYSELF TO SKIN AND BONE AND WORRET MYSELF AS IF I WAS A CHURN WI BUTTER A COMING IN'T FOR NO LANDLORD IN ENGLAND NOT IF HE WAS KING GEORGE HIMSELF
WHAT'S TO MAKE ME SURE AS THE HOUSE WON'T BE PUT O BOARD WAGE AFORE WE'RE MANY MONTHS OLDER AND THEN
O NIGHTS WI TWENTY GALLONS O MILK ON MY MIND AND DINGALL ULL TAKE NO MORE BUTTER LET ALONE PAYING FOR IT
THAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE FETCHING AND CARRYING YOU WILL NOT HAVE MISSUS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE WHO THOUGHT THAT THIS ENTRANCE INTO PARTICULARS INDICATED A DISTANT INCLINATION TO COMPROMISE ON MISSUS POYSER'S PART
AND I SHALL NOT FORGET YOUR READINESS TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR LANDLORD AS WELL AS A NEIGHBOUR I KNOW YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOUR LEASE RENEWED FOR THREE YEARS WHEN THE PRESENT ONE EXPIRES OTHERWISE I DARESAY THURLE WHO IS A MAN OF SOME CAPITAL
EVEN WITHOUT THE FINAL THREAT HER HUSBAND REALLY ALARMED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR LEAVING THE OLD PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN BRED AND BORN FOR HE BELIEVED THE OLD SQUIRE HAD SMALL SPITE ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING
SIGN HER SOUL AWAY I'VE A RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR I MAKE ONE QUARTER O THE RENT AND SAVE ANOTHER QUARTER
TILL A PLACE TUMBLES DOWN AND NOT THEN ON'Y WI BEGGING AND PRAYING AND HAVING TO PAY HALF AND BEING STRUNG UP WI THE RENT AS IT'S MUCH IF HE GETS ENOUGH OUT O THE LAND TO PAY FOR ALL HE'S PUT HIS OWN MONEY INTO THE GROUND BEFOREHAND SEE
THERE'S NO PLEASURE LIVING IF YOU'RE TO BE CORKED UP FOR EVER AND ONLY DRIBBLE YOUR MIND OUT BY THE SLY LIKE A LEAKY BARREL I SHAN'T REPENT SAYING WHAT I THINK
AND THERE'S LITTLE LIKELIHOOD FOR IT SEEMS AS IF THEM AS AREN'T WANTED HERE ARE TH
THIS MICHAELMAS TWELVEMONTH SAID MISTER POYSER AND GOING INTO A STRANGE PARISH WHERE THEE KNOW'ST NOBODY IT'LL BE HARD UPON US BOTH
I WANT HIM TO FEEL WHAT SHE FEELS IT'S HIS WORK SHE WAS A CHILD AS IT UD HA GONE T ANYBODY'S HEART TO LOOK AT I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE'S DONE IT WAS HIM BROUGHT HER TO IT AND HE SHALL KNOW IT HE SHALL FEEL IT
SMILING UP AT ME I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME AND WAS GOOD ADAM'S VOICE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY SINKING INTO A HOARSE UNDERTONE AS IF HE WERE ONLY TALKING TO HIMSELF BUT NOW HE SAID ABRUPTLY LOOKING AT MISTER IRWINE
IS DINAH MORRIS COME TO EM SIR SETH SAID THEY'D SENT FOR HER NO MISTER POYSER TELLS ME SHE WAS NOT COME WHEN HE LEFT THEY'RE AFRAID THE LETTER HAS NOT REACHED HER
IT SEEMS THEY HAD NO EXACT ADDRESS ADAM SAT RUMINATING A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID
WHEN A HIGH PRINCIPLED GENTLEWOMAN FALLS FROM HER PEDESTAL NEVER HAD SHE EXPERIENCED A MOMENT'S CALM OR PEACE OR HAPPINESS SINCE THE FATAL NIGHT OF QUITTING HER HOME SHE HAD TAKEN A BLIND LEAP IN A MOMENT OF WILD PASSION
REPUTATION HOME ALL THAT MAKES LIFE OF VALUE TO WOMAN SHE HAD FORFEITED HER DUTY TO GOD HAD DELIBERATELY BROKEN HIS COMMANDMENTS FOR THE ONE POOR MISERABLE MISTAKE OF FLYING WITH FRANCIS LEVISON
BUT THE INSTANT THE STEP WAS IRREVOCABLE THE INSTANT SHE HAD LEFT THE BARRIER BEHIND REPENTANCE SET IN EVEN IN THE FIRST DAYS OF HER DEPARTURE IN THE FLEETING MOMENTS OF ABANDONMENT WHEN IT MAY BE SUPPOSED SHE MIGHT MOMENTARILY FORGET CONSCIENCE
A STRANGER MIGHT HAVE ATTRIBUTED THESE SIGNS TO THE STATE OF HER HEALTH SHE KNEW BETTER KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE EFFECTS OF HER WRETCHED MIND AND HEART IT WAS VERY LATE FOR BREAKFAST BUT WHY SHOULD SHE RISE EARLY ONLY TO DRAG THROUGH ANOTHER ENDLESS DAY
IN SEEKING A DIVORCE AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT WAS GRANTED WAS NOW DAILY EXPECTED SHE WAS ANXIOUS FOR IT ANXIOUS THAT CAPTAIN LEVISON SHOULD RENDER HER THE ONLY REPARATION IN HIS POWER BEFORE THE BIRTH OF HER UNHAPPY CHILD
LAST OUT A WHOLE TEN MONTHS YOU ARE IN EGREGIOUS ERROR COMPLIMENTS THE VERY OPPOSITE TO HONEY AND SWEETNESS HAVE GENERALLY SUPERVENED LONG BEFORE TRY IT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME TWO LETTERS SHE CONTINUED
AND THEY ARE BOTH IN THE SAME HANDWRITING YOUR SOLICITORS I BELIEVE UP WENT HIS HAND AT THE LAST WORD AND HE MADE A SORT OF GRAB AT THE LETTERS STALKED TO THE FARTHEST WINDOW OPENED IT AND GLANCED OVER ITS CONTENTS SIR

YOU MAY DROP THAT ODIOUS TITLE ISABEL WHICH HAS STUCK TO ME TOO LONG I OWN A BETTER NOW WHAT ONE PRAY YOU CAN LOOK AND SEE LADY ISABEL TOOK UP THE LETTER AND READ IT SIR FRANCIS SWALLOWED DOWN HIS COFFEE AND RANG THE
BESIDES I SHOULD NOT CHOOSE FOR THE OLD MAN'S FUNERAL TO TAKE PLACE WITHOUT ME
YOU KNOW THAT THE FRENCH PROTESTANT MINISTER IS PREPARED TO MARRY US THE INSTANT NEWS OF THE DIVORCE SHALL ARRIVE
YOU WILL WAIT I CANNOT WAIT HE REPLIED HIS TONE CHANGING TO ONE OF DETERMINATION IT IS USELESS TO URGE IT HE BROKE FROM HER AND LEFT THE ROOM AND IN ANOTHER MINUTE HAD LEFT THE HOUSE PIERRE ATTENDING HIM A FEELING AMOUNTING TO A CONVICTION
HAD HE COME WHO IS IT SHE ASKED OF THE NURSE MILADI IT IS MONSIEUR AND PIERRE IS WITH HIM I HAVE BEGGED MILADY OFTEN AND OFTEN NOT TO FRET FOR MONSIEUR WOULD SURELY COME MILADI SEE I AM RIGHT
SHE PURSUED BENDING HER EYES DETERMINATELY UPON HIM IT MUST BE WITH ALL MY HEART RETURNED SIR FRANCIS IT IS YOU WHO HAVE THROWN OUT THE CHALLENGE MIND
HE SHOULD HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN THROWING OFF THE MASK BUT HE WAS AN ILL TEMPERED MAN AND TO HEAR THAT THE LETTER HAD BEEN FOUND TO HAVE THE FALSENESS OF HIS FINE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISES LAID BARE DID NOT IMPROVE HIS TEMPER NOW LADY ISABEL CONTINUED
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE UNDECEIVED ME THEN TO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THE HOPES I WAS CHERISHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE UNBORN CHILD WERE WORSE THAN VAIN I DID NOT JUDGE SO HE REPLIED THE EXCITED STATE YOU THEN APPEARED TO BE IN
WELL ISABEL YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT IT IS AN AWFUL SACRIFICE FOR A MAN IN MY POSITION TO MARRY A DIVORCED WOMAN THE HECTIC FLUSHED INTO HER THIN CHEEKS BUT HER VOICE SOUNDED CALM AS BEFORE
AND TO MAKE YOU MY WIFE WOULD SO OFFEND ALL MY FAMILY THAT STAY INTERRUPTED LADY ISABEL YOU NEED NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF TO FIND NEEDLESS EXCUSES HAD YOU TAKEN THIS JOURNEY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING ME YOUR WIFE WERE YOU TO PROPOSE TO DO SO THIS DAY
YOU LADIES SHOULD THINK OF THAT BEFOREHAND YES SHE SADLY ANSWERED MAY HEAVEN HELP ALL TO DO SO WHO MAY BE TEMPTED AS I WAS IF YOU MEAN THAT AS A REPROACH TO ME IT'S RATHER OUT OF PLACE CHAFED SIR FRANCIS
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WOULD IMPLY SHE SAID DRAWING HER SHAWL ROUND HER WITH A FRESH SHIVER HOW ON THE WRONG SCENT WITH REGARD TO YOUR HUSBAND AND THAT HARE GIRL YOU WERE BLINDLY OUTRAGEOUSLY JEALOUS OF HIM GO ON
WHAT REASON I MUST REQUEST YOU TO TELL ME I OVERHEARD SCRAPS OF THEIR CONVERSATION NOW AND THEN IN THOSE MEETINGS AND SO GATHERED MY INFORMATION YOU TOLD A DIFFERENT TALE TO ME SIR FRANCIS WAS HER REMARK
WHO IS HE LIKE ISABEL MY HANDSOME SELF WERE HE LIKE YOU IN SPIRIT I WOULD PRAY THAT HE MIGHT DIE ERE HE COULD SPEAK OR THINK SHE BURST FORTH AND THEN REMEMBERING THE RESOLUTION MARKED OUT FOR HERSELF SUBSIDED
I RECEIVED THESE FROM YOU A MONTH AGO SHE SAID THEY CAME BY POST AND NEVER HAD THE GRACE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM HE RETURNED IN A SORT OF MOCK REPROACHFUL TONE FORTY POUNDS THAT WAS THE AMOUNT WAS IT NOT I BELIEVE SO
I BEG OF YOU TO CEASE SHE PASSIONATELY INTERRUPTED WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR TAKE YOU FOR WHY HOW CAN YOU LIVE YOU HAVE NO FORTUNE YOU MUST RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM SOME ONE I WILL NOT RECEIVE IT FROM YOU IF THE WHOLE WORLD DENIED ME
WHICH WE NOW THOUGHT WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED WERE LEFT BEHIND THE LAST THING TO BE DONE WAS PLANTING A BROKEN SKI UPRIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE DEPOT IT WAS WISTING WHO DID THIS THINKING PRESUMABLY THAT AN EXTRA MARK WOULD DO NO HARM
AS WE HAD NOTHING TO LEAN AGAINST WE WENT ON LIKE THIS SLOWLY ENOUGH BUT THE MAIN THING WAS THAT WE MADE PROGRESS THE GROUND AT FIRST GAVE ONE THE IMPRESSION OF RISING THOUGH NOT MUCH THE GOING WAS EXTREMELY HEAVY
FOR WHAT REASON IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY AS THE STORM CONTINUED UNABATED AND THE DRIFT NOW COMBINED WITH FALLING SNOW WAS THICKER THAN EVER IT WAS ALL THE DRIVER COULD DO TO SEE HIS OWN DOGS THE SURFACE
TURNING OUT OF ONE'S GOOD WARM SLEEPING BAG AND STANDING OUTSIDE FOR SOME TIME IN THIN CLOTHES WATCHING THE WEATHER WE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT A GLEAM LIKE THIS A CLEARING IN THE WEATHER MIGHT COME SUDDENLY AND THEN ONE HAD TO BE ON THE SPOT
BUT WHAT ACCORDING TO DEAD RECKONING OUR LATITUDE THAT EVENING
THE SURFACE REMAINED ABOUT THE SAME POSSIBLY RATHER MORE UNDULATING THAT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING HERE AT SOME TIME AND VIOLENTLY TOO WAS SHOWN BY THE UNDER SURFACE WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF SASTRUGI AS HARD AS IRON
LUCKILY FOR US THE SNOWFALL OF THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD FILLED THESE UP SO AS TO PRESENT A LEVEL SURFACE IT WAS HEAVY GOING THOUGH BETTER THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AS WE WERE ADVANCING STILL BLINDLY
ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED THREATENINGLY NEAR AND RIGHT OVER US WE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT THE IMPOSING SIGHT BUT NATURE DID NOT EXPOSE HER OBJECTS OF INTEREST FOR LONG THE FOG ROLLED OVER AGAIN THICK HEAVY AND DARK
TWO LONG NARROW MOUNTAIN RIDGES TO THE WEST OF US RUNNING NORTH AND SOUTH AND COMPLETELY COVERED WITH SNOW THESE
DOES NOT BEGIN VERY PROMISINGLY FOG FOG AND AGAIN FOG ALSO FINE FALLING SNOW WHICH MAKES THE GOING IMPOSSIBLE POOR BEASTS THEY HAVE TOILED HARD TO GET THE SLEDGES FORWARD TO DAY
BUT HOW LONG SHOULD WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR CLEAR WEATHER THAT QUESTION WAS UNANSWERABLE POSSIBLY A WEEK OR EVEN A FORTNIGHT AND WE HAD NO TIME FOR THAT BETTER GO STRAIGHT ON THEN AND TAKE WHAT MIGHT COME
AND OLAV BJAALAND LAY CLOSER TOGETHER BEHIND THIS GROUP THE AIR HAD BEEN HEAVY AND BLACK THE WHOLE TIME SHOWING THAT MORE LAND MUST BE CONCEALED THERE SUDDENLY
THEY WERE NOT VERY GRAND BUT BETTER ONES WERE NOT TO BE OBTAINED FOR THAT MATTER THE SITE OF THE DEPOT WAS SO WELL MARKED BY ITS POSITION UNDER THE FOOT OF THE GLACIER THAT WE AGREED IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS IT
BUT THAT AFTER ALL WAS NOT MUCH OF A HELP TO OUR DRIVERS
IT REQUIRED SOME STUDY TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE TRAP WE HAD RUN OURSELVES INTO TOWARDS THE GROUP OF MOUNTAINS LAST DESCRIBED WHICH NOW LAY TO THE EAST OF US
A FISSURE HAD OPENED MAKING A GATEWAY ABOUT SIX FEET WIDE THIS FORMATION LIKE EVERY THING ELSE ON THE GLACIER WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY OLD AND FOR THE MOST PART FILLED WITH SNOW
FROM THIS POINT THE GLACIER AS FAR AS OUR VIEW EXTENDED TO THE SOUTH LOOKED BETTER AND BETTER
WE HAD REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FEET OR A DROP FROM THE BUTCHER'S OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FEET WE NOW KNEW VERY WELL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THIS ASCENT TO MAKE AGAIN PERHAPS EVEN MORE
AND THIS IDEA DID NOT AROUSE ANY PARTICULAR ENTHUSIASM IN MY DIARY I SEE THAT I CONCLUDE THE DAY WITH THE FOLLOWING WORDS WHAT WILL THE NEXT SURPRISE BE I WONDER IT WAS IN FACT
AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY THAT WE WERE UNDERTAKING THROUGH NEW REGIONS NEW MOUNTAINS GLACIERS AND SO ON WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE
BUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE TURNS AND CIRCUITS WE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO MAKE IT WAS NOT SO SHORT AFTER ALL WE SET OUR TENT ON A GOOD SOLID FOUNDATION AND WERE WELL PLEASED WITH THE DAY'S WORK
PEAKS OF THE MOST VARIED FORMS ROSE HIGH INTO THE AIR PARTLY COVERED WITH DRIVING CLOUDS SOME WERE SHARP BUT MOST WERE LONG AND ROUNDED HERE AND THERE ONE SAW BRIGHT SHINING GLACIERS
AND LITTLE BOY BLUE IN SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN CHARLES PERRAULT PUBLISHED IN FRANCE
BOSTON CHILDREN AT THAT DATE SAYS MISTER WHITMORE WERE FED UPON GOSPEL FOOD AND IT SEEMS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT AN EDITION COULD HAVE BEEN SOLD
IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE NONE OF THE EARLIER EDITIONS HOWEVER CONTAINED ALL THE RHYMES SO WELL KNOWN AT THE PRESENT DAY SINCE EVERY DECADE HAS ADDED ITS QUOTA TO THE MASS OF JINGLES ATTRIBUTED TO MOTHER GOOSE
FASTENED ABOUT THE WAIST WITH A PRETTY PINK SASH AND THERE WERE WHITE RUFFLES AROUND HER NECK AND PINK RIBBONS IN HER HAIR ALL THE SHEPHERDS AND SHEPHERDESSES UPON THE HILLS BOTH YOUNG AND OLD SOON CAME TO KNOW LITTLE BO PEEP VERY WELL INDEED
DEEP WRINKLES SEAMED HER FACE AND HANDS WHILE HER NOSE AND CHIN WERE SO POINTED THAT THEY NEARLY MET SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT TO LOOK UPON BUT BO PEEP HAD LEARNED TO BE POLITE TO THE AGED SO SHE ANSWERED SWEETLY
THEN YOU ARE WISER THAT MOST PEOPLE AND IF YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM YOU ALSO KNOW THEY WILL COME HOME OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL ALL BE WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM AS USUAL
OH SAID LITTLE BO PEEP IN SURPRISE DO THEY WAG THEIR TAILS I NEVER NOTICED THAT INDEED EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN THEN YOU ARE NOT VERY OBSERVING FOR ONE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT SHEEP
VERY SOON I SHALL SEE THE SHEEP COMING BACK BUT TIME PASSED AWAY AND STILL THE ERRANT FLOCK FAILED TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE SOON THE HEAD OF THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS BEGAN TO NOD
SHE DECIDED SHE WOULD NOT WAIT ANY LONGER SO UP SHE TOOK HER LITTLE CROOK DETERMINED FOR TO FIND THEM AND BEGAN CLIMBING THE HILL WHEN SHE GOT TO THE TOP THERE WAS NEVER A SIGHT OF SHEEP ABOUT
ONLY A GREEN VALLEY AND ANOTHER HILL BEYOND NOW REALLY ALARMED FOR THE SAFETY OF HER CHARGE BO PEEP HURRIED INTO THE VALLEY AND UP THE FARTHER HILL SIDE PANTING AND TIRED SHE REACHED THE SUMMIT AND PAUSING BREATHLESSLY
BUT AFTER AWHILE THE TINY MAID REALIZED THAT ALL HER TEARS WOULD NOT BRING BACK THE TAILS TO HER LAMBKINS SO SHE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND DRIED HER EYES AND AROSE FROM THE GROUND JUST AS THE OLD WOMAN HOBBLED UP TO HER
SO YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR SHEEP DEARIE SHE SAID IN HER CRACKED VOICE YES REPLIED LITTLE BO PEEP WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING A SOB BUT LOOK MOTHER THEY VE ALL LEFT THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM WHY SO THEY HAVE EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN
AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH AS IF SOMETHING PLEASED HER WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HAS BECOME OF THEIR TAILS ASKED THE GIRL OH SOME ONE HAS PROBABLY CUT THEM OFF THEY MAKE NICE TIPPETS IN WINTER TIME YOU KNOW
BUT THE VERY FIRST SHEEP SHE CAME TO REFUSED TO ALLOW HER TO SEW ON THE TAIL AND RAN AWAY FROM HER AND THE OTHERS DID THE SAME SO THAT FINALLY SHE WAS UTTERLY DISCOURAGED SHE WAS BEGINNING TO CRY AGAIN WHEN THE SAME OLD WOMAN SHE HAD BEFORE MET
THE PEOPLE MARCH HE BECAME AWARE OF SOMEONE URGING A GLASS OF CLEAR FLUID UPON HIS ATTENTION LOOKED UP AND DISCOVERED THIS WAS A DARK YOUNG MAN IN A YELLOW GARMENT HE TOOK THE DOSE FORTHWITH AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS GLOWING
A TALL MAN IN A BLACK ROBE STOOD BY HIS SHOULDER AND POINTED TO THE HALF OPEN DOOR INTO THE HALL THIS MAN WAS SHOUTING CLOSE TO HIS EAR AND YET WHAT WAS SAID WAS INDISTINCT BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS UPROAR FROM THE GREAT THEATRE
A PARTIALLY OPENED DOOR GAVE A GLIMPSE OF THE CROWDED HALL AND ADMITTED A VAST UNEVEN TUMULT A HAMMERING CLAPPING AND SHOUTING THAT DIED AWAY AND BEGAN AGAIN AND ROSE TO A THUNDEROUS PITCH
HIS EYES SEARCHED THEIR FACES THEY HAVE TOLD HIM NOTHING CRIED THE GIRL TELL ME TELL ME CRIED GRAHAM YOU ARE THE MASTER OF THE EARTH YOU ARE OWNER OF THE WORLD
IT IS LONDON YES SAID THE YOUNGER MAN AND THOSE WHO MEET IN THE GREAT HALL WITH THE WHITE ATLAS HOW DOES IT CONCERN ME
ON THE ONE HAND WAS THE WHITE COUNCIL POWERFUL DISCIPLINED FEW
AND LINCOLN GESTICULATING THE VOICES WITHOUT EXPLAINED THEIR SOUNDLESS LIPS SHOW US THE SLEEPER SHOW US THE SLEEPER WAS THE BURDEN OF THE UPROAR MEN WERE BAWLING FOR ORDER SILENCE
THE VOICES WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AND UPBORNE BY A TORRENT OF INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC MUSIC LIKE THE MUSIC OF AN ORGAN
MARCH HIS MOUTH SHAPED INAUDIBLE HEROIC WORDS HE WAVED HIS ARM AGAIN AND POINTED TO THE ARCHWAY SHOUTING ONWARD THEY WERE NO LONGER MARKING TIME THEY WERE MARCHING TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP IN THAT HOST
HANDS CLUTCHING WEAPONS ALL WERE SWINGING WITH THOSE MARCHING CADENCES FACES CAME OUT OF THE CONFUSION TO HIM AS HE STOOD THERE EYES MET HIS AND PASSED AND VANISHED MEN GESTICULATED TO HIM SHOUTED INAUDIBLE PERSONAL THINGS
TRIBUTARY GANGWAYS FROM THE REMOTE UPLANDS OF THE HALL THRUST DOWNWARD IN AN INCESSANT REPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP THE UNISON OF THE SONG WAS ENRICHED AND COMPLICATED BY THE MASSIVE ECHOES OF ARCHES AND PASSAGES MEN AND WOMEN
ON THEIR WAY THE PLATFORMS CROSSED THE THAMES TWICE AND PASSED IN A BROAD VIADUCT ACROSS ONE OF THE GREAT ROADS THAT ENTERED THE CITY FROM THE NORTH IN BOTH CASES HIS IMPRESSION WAS SWIFT AND IN BOTH VERY VIVID
WHO WERE DIRECTING THEIR LABOURS THE BURLY LABOURERS OF THE OLD VICTORIAN TIMES HAD FOLLOWED THAT DRAY HORSE AND ALL SUCH LIVING FORCE PRODUCERS TO EXTINCTION THE PLACE OF HIS COSTLY MUSCLES WAS TAKEN BY SOME DEXTEROUS MACHINE
THE LATTER DAY LABOURER MALE AS WELL AS FEMALE WAS ESSENTIALLY A MACHINE MINDER AND FEEDER A SERVANT AND ATTENDANT OR AN ARTIST UNDER DIRECTION THE WOMEN IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE GRAHAM REMEMBERED
THEY PENETRATED DOWNWARD EVER DOWNWARD TOWARDS THE WORKING PLACES PRESENTLY THEY PASSED UNDERNEATH ONE OF THE STREETS OF THE MOVING WAYS AND SAW ITS PLATFORMS RUNNING ON THEIR RAILS FAR OVERHEAD AND CHINKS OF WHITE LIGHTS BETWEEN THE TRANSVERSE SLITS
IN SPITE OF EVERY PRECAUTION THE LABOUR POLICEMAN TOLD THEM IN A DEPRESSED TONE THE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT INFREQUENTLY ROBBED BEYOND WAS A GALLERY OF WOMEN BUSIED IN CUTTING AND SETTING SLABS OF ARTIFICIAL RUBY
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE SAID GRAHAM THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE TRYING TO AVOID A START AT A PARTICULARLY STRIKING DISFIGUREMENT SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER WITH HERSELF THAN THAT SAID ASANO
AND FIRST ONE AND THEN ALL THE WHITE STAINED MEN WHO WERE WORKING THERE HAD TAKEN UP THE BEATING REFRAIN SINGING IT DEFIANTLY THE SONG OF THE REVOLT THE FEET UPON THE PLANKS THUNDERED NOW TO THE RHYTHM OF THE SONG TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP
THE ROAR AND RATTLE OF BELT AND ARMATURE OF ILL LIT SUBTERRANEAN AISLES OF SLEEPING PLACES ILLIMITABLE VISTAS OF PIN POINT LIGHTS HERE WAS THE SMELL OF TANNING AND HERE THE REEK OF A BREWERY
THAT MEN YELLED TO ONE ANOTHER THAT WOMEN TOOK UP SCREAMING THAT WAS PASSING LIKE THE FIRST BREEZE OF A THUNDERSTORM CHILL AND SUDDEN THROUGH THE CITY WAS THIS OSTROG HAS ORDERED THE BLACK POLICE TO LONDON THE BLACK POLICE ARE COMING FROM SOUTH AFRICA THE BLACK POLICE THE BLACK POLICE
HE HESITATED LOOKED AT GRAHAM'S FACE AND TOLD HIM THE THING HE ALREADY KNEW BUT HOW CAN THEY KNOW ASKED ASANO GRAHAM HEARD SOMEONE SHOUTING STOP ALL WORK STOP ALL WORK
HE LOOKED UP AT THE GREAT CLIFF OF BUILDINGS ON EITHER SIDE VANISHING INTO BLUE HAZE AT LAST ABOVE THE LIGHTS AND DOWN TO THE ROARING TIERS OF PLATFORMS AND THE SHOUTING RUNNING PEOPLE WHO WERE GESTICULATING PAST
HE SHED A FEW DROPS FROM THE BITTER FOUNTAIN OVER HER LIPS THOUGH THE SIGHT OF HER ALMOST MOVED HIM TO PITY THEN TOUCHED HER SIDE WITH THE POINT OF HIS ARROW AT THE TOUCH SHE AWOKE AND OPENED EYES UPON CUPID HIMSELF INVISIBLE
WHICH SO STARTLED HIM THAT IN HIS CONFUSION HE WOUNDED HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN ARROW HEEDLESS OF HIS WOUND HIS WHOLE THOUGHT NOW WAS TO REPAIR THE MISCHIEF HE HAD DONE AND HE POURED THE BALMY DROPS OF JOY OVER ALL HER SILKEN RINGLETS
PSYCHE HENCEFORTH FROWNED UPON BY VENUS DERIVED NO BENEFIT FROM ALL HER CHARMS TRUE ALL EYES WERE CAST EAGERLY UPON HER AND EVERY MOUTH SPOKE HER PRAISES
YOU SHOULD RATHER HAVE GRIEVED WHEN THE PEOPLE SHOWERED UPON ME UNDESERVED HONORS AND WITH ONE VOICE CALLED ME A VENUS I NOW PERCEIVE THAT I AM A VICTIM TO THAT NAME I SUBMIT LEAD ME TO THAT ROCK TO WHICH MY UNHAPPY FATE HAS DESTINED ME
BUT THE HAPPY RETREAT OF SOME GOD DRAWN BY ADMIRATION AND WONDER SHE APPROACHED THE BUILDING AND VENTURED TO ENTER EVERY OBJECT SHE MET FILLED HER WITH PLEASURE AND AMAZEMENT GOLDEN PILLARS SUPPORTED THE VAULTED ROOF
AND THE WALLS WERE ENRICHED WITH CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS REPRESENTING BEASTS OF THE CHASE AND RURAL SCENES ADAPTED TO DELIGHT THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER PROCEEDING ONWARD SHE PERCEIVED THAT BESIDES THE APARTMENTS OF STATE
SOON MADE HER CONFESS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO FILL HER BOSOM WITH DARK SUSPICIONS CALL TO MIND THEY SAID
STARTLED WITH WHICH HE OPENED HIS EYES AND FIXED THEM FULL UPON HER THEN WITHOUT SAYING ONE WORD HE SPREAD HIS WHITE WINGS AND FLEW OUT OF THE WINDOW PSYCHE IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO FOLLOW HIM FELL FROM THE WINDOW TO THE GROUND
BY SEPARATING AND SORTING EVERYTHING TO ITS PROPER PLACE AND KIND
AND THE SERENE SPIRIT OF THE FLOOD HAS LULLED THEM TO REST YOU MAY THEN CROSS IN SAFETY AND YOU WILL FIND THE WOOLLY GOLD STICKING TO THE BUSHES AND THE TRUNKS OF THE TREES THUS THE COMPASSIONATE RIVER GOD GAVE PSYCHE INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO ACCOMPLISH HER TASK
AND I AM NOT SATISFIED YET THAT YOU HAVE ANY CAPACITY TO MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL BUT I HAVE ANOTHER TASK FOR YOU HERE TAKE THIS BOX AND GO YOUR WAY TO THE INFERNAL SHADES AND GIVE THIS BOX TO PROSERPINE
THE FABLE OF CUPID AND PSYCHE IS USUALLY CONSIDERED ALLEGORICAL THE GREEK NAME FOR A BUTTERFLY IS PSYCHE AND THE SAME WORD MEANS THE SOUL THERE IS NO ILLUSTRATION OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL SO STRIKING AND BEAUTIFUL AS THE BUTTERFLY
IN THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS DESCRIBED IN THE ALLEGORY MILTON ALLUDES TO THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE IN THE CONCLUSION OF HIS COMUS CELESTIAL CUPID HER FAMED SON ADVANCED HOLDS HIS DEAR PSYCHE SWEET ENTRANCED
THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE FIRST APPEARS IN THE WORKS OF APULEIUS A WRITER OF THE SECOND CENTURY OF OUR ERA IT IS THEREFORE OF MUCH MORE RECENT DATE THAN MOST OF THE LEGENDS OF THE AGE OF FABLE IT IS THIS THAT KEATS ALLUDES TO IN HIS ODE TO PSYCHE
O LATEST BORN AND LOVELIEST VISION FAR OF ALL OLYMPUS FADED HIERARCHY FAIRER THAN PHOEBE'S SAPPHIRE REGIONED STAR OR VESPER AMOROUS GLOW WORM OF THE SKY FAIRER THAN THESE THOUGH TEMPLE THOU HAST NONE

CHEESE IS ON THE HOUSE AT ALL WINE SALES FOR PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS TO SNACK UPON AND THUS BRING OUT THE FULL FLAVOR OF THE CELLARED VINTAGES BUT PROFESSIONAL WINE TASTERS ARE FORBIDDEN ANY CHEESE BETWEEN SIPS
SUCH NOTABLES AS SAINTE MAURE
GRAPE CHEESE NAMED FROM THE NEUCHATEL WINE IN WHICH IT IS AGED
THAT ARE PACKED IN MINIATURE WINE BARRELS STRONGLY SUGGESTING WHAT SHOULD BE DRUNK WITH SUCH EXCELLENT CHEESES HUNGARIAN TOKAY OTHER FOREIGN CHEESES GO TO MARKET WRAPPED IN VINE LEAVES THE AFFINITY HAS CLEARLY BEEN LAID DOWN IN HEAVEN
ONLY THE ENGLISH SEEM TO HAVE A FORTISSIMO TASTE IN THE GO WITH WINES ACCORDING TO THESE MATCHES REGISTERED BY ANDRE SIMON IN THE ART OF GOOD LIVING RED CHESHIRE WITH LIGHT TAWNY PORT WHITE CHESHIRE
THIS IS ALSO TRUE OF OUR NATIVE JERSEY LIGHTNING AND HARD CIDER WITH THEIR ACCOMPANYING NEW YORK STATE CHEESE
TO WHOM AGRICULTURE WAS UNKNOWN THOUGH THE SEA PROLIFIC OF FISH LOBSTERS AND SEALS GREATLY LIGHTENED THEIR MISERIES
OR MICMACS OF NOVA SCOTIA CLOSELY RESEMBLED THEM IN HABITS AND CONDITION FROM NOVA SCOTIA TO THE SAINT LAWRENCE THERE WAS NO POPULATION WORTHY OF THE NAME FROM THE GULF OF SAINT LAWRENCE TO LAKE ONTARIO THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE GREAT RIVER
THEIR ORDINARY SUSTENANCE WAS DERIVED FROM THE CHASE THOUGH OFTEN GOADED BY DEADLY FAMINE THEY WOULD SUBSIST ON ROOTS THE BARK AND BUDS OF TREES
TO MORROW ALL AGAIN WAS SOLITUDE AND THE OTTAWA WAS COVERED WITH THE CANOES OF THE RETURNING WARRIORS ALONG THIS STREAM A MAIN ROUTE OF TRAFFIC THE SILENCE OF THE WILDERNESS WAS BROKEN ONLY BY THE SPLASH OF THE PASSING PADDLE
INDICATED A PEOPLE FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE FAMISHED WANDERERS OF THE SAGUENAY OR THEIR LESS ABJECT KINDRED OF NEW ENGLAND
WOULD HAVE FORMED HIS CHRISTIAN EMPIRE IN THE WILDERNESS BUT ONE BY ONE THESE KINDRED PEOPLES WERE UPROOTED AND SWEPT AWAY WHILE THE NEIGHBORING ALGONQUINS TO WHOM THEY HAD BEEN A BULWARK WERE INVOLVED WITH THEM IN A COMMON RUIN
THE GUNS AND TOMAHAWKS OF THE IROQUOIS WERE THE RUIN OF THEIR HOPES COULD THEY HAVE CURBED OR CONVERTED THOSE FEROCIOUS BANDS IT IS LITTLE LESS THAN CERTAIN
UNMOLESTED BY INDIAN ENEMIES AND FED BY A RICH COMMERCE SHE WOULD HAVE PUT FORTH A VIGOROUS GROWTH TRUE TO HER FAR REACHING AND ADVENTUROUS GENIUS SHE WOULD HAVE OCCUPIED THE WEST WITH TRADERS SETTLERS AND GARRISONS
TRUE NERVOUS VERY VERY DREADFULLY NERVOUS I HAD BEEN AND AM BUT WHY WILL YOU SAY THAT I AM MAD THE DISEASE HAD SHARPENED MY SENSES NOT DESTROYED NOT DULLED THEM
YES IT WAS THIS HE HAD THE EYE OF A VULTURE A PALE BLUE EYE WITH A FILM OVER IT WHENEVER IT FELL UPON ME MY BLOOD RAN COLD AND SO BY DEGREES VERY GRADUALLY
WITH WHAT CAUTION WITH WHAT FORESIGHT WITH WHAT DISSIMULATION I WENT TO WORK I WAS NEVER KINDER TO THE OLD MAN THAN DURING THE WHOLE WEEK BEFORE I KILLED HIM AND EVERY NIGHT ABOUT MIDNIGHT I TURNED THE LATCH OF HIS DOOR AND OPENED IT
SO FAR THAT I COULD SEE HIM AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED HA WOULD A MADMAN HAVE BEEN SO WISE AS THIS AND THEN WHEN MY HEAD WAS WELL IN THE ROOM I UNDID THE LANTERN CAUTIOUSLY OH SO CAUTIOUSLY
FOR IT WAS NOT THE OLD MAN WHO VEXED ME BUT HIS EVIL EYE AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THE DAY BROKE I WENT BOLDLY INTO THE CHAMBER AND SPOKE COURAGEOUSLY TO HIM CALLING HIM BY NAME IN A HEARTY TONE AND INQUIRING HOW HE HAS PASSED THE NIGHT
NEVER BEFORE THAT NIGHT HAD I FELT THE EXTENT OF MY OWN POWERS OF MY SAGACITY I COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN MY FEELINGS OF TRIUMPH TO THINK THAT THERE I WAS OPENING THE DOOR LITTLE BY LITTLE
STEADILY I HAD MY HEAD IN AND WAS ABOUT TO OPEN THE LANTERN WHEN MY THUMB SLIPPED UPON THE TIN FASTENING AND THE OLD MAN SPRANG UP IN BED CRYING OUT WHO'S THERE I KEPT QUITE STILL AND SAID NOTHING
IN APPROACHING HIM HAD STALKED WITH HIS BLACK SHADOW BEFORE HIM AND ENVELOPED THE VICTIM AND IT WAS THE MOURNFUL INFLUENCE OF THE UNPERCEIVED SHADOW THAT CAUSED HIM TO FEEL ALTHOUGH HE NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD TO FEEL THE PRESENCE OF MY HEAD WITHIN THE ROOM
IF STILL YOU THINK ME MAD YOU WILL THINK SO NO LONGER WHEN I DESCRIBE THE WISE PRECAUTIONS I TOOK FOR THE CONCEALMENT OF THE BODY THE NIGHT WANED AND I WORKED HASTILY BUT IN SILENCE FIRST OF ALL I DISMEMBERED THE CORPSE I CUT OFF THE HEAD
IT WAS FOUR O'CLOCK STILL DARK AS MIDNIGHT AS THE BELL SOUNDED THE HOUR THERE CAME A KNOCKING AT THE STREET DOOR I WENT DOWN TO OPEN IT WITH A LIGHT HEART FOR WHAT HAD I NOW TO FEAR THERE ENTERED THREE MEN WHO INTRODUCED THEMSELVES
AND WITH A HEIGHTENED VOICE YET THE SOUND INCREASED AND WHAT COULD I DO IT WAS A LOW DULL QUICK SOUND MUCH SUCH A SOUND AS A WATCH MAKES WHEN ENVELOPED IN COTTON I GASPED FOR BREATH AND YET THE OFFICERS HEARD IT NOT
I PACED THE FLOOR TO AND FRO WITH HEAVY STRIDES AS IF EXCITED TO FURY BY THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE MEN BUT THE NOISE STEADILY INCREASED OH GOD WHAT COULD I DO I FOAMED I RAVED I SWORE
WHO PRESENTED HER MIRROR TO THE TEMPLE TO BE USED FOR BELL METAL BUT AFTERWARDS SHE MUCH REGRETTED HER MIRROR SHE REMEMBERED THINGS THAT HER MOTHER HAD TOLD HER ABOUT IT AND SHE REMEMBERED THAT IT HAD BELONGED NOT ONLY TO HER MOTHER BUT TO HER MOTHER'S MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND SHE REMEMBERED SOME HAPPY SMILES WHICH IT HAD REFLECTED
OF COURSE EVERYBODY HEARD OF THE MATTER AND EVERYBODY SOON KNEW WHOSE MIRROR IT WAS THAT WOULD NOT MELT AND BECAUSE OF THIS PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF HER SECRET FAULT THE POOR WOMAN BECAME VERY MUCH ASHAMED AND VERY ANGRY AND AS SHE COULD NOT BEAR THE SHAME SHE DROWNED HERSELF
OR BELL OF MUGEN NOW THERE ARE QUEER OLD JAPANESE BELIEFS IN THE MAGICAL EFFICACY OF A CERTAIN MENTAL OPERATION IMPLIED THOUGH NOT DESCRIBED BY THE VERB
FOR THE SAME REASON THAT SISTER HELEN MADE A LITTLE MAN OF WAX AND NAIL IT
AFTER THE BELL HAD BEEN ROLLED INTO THE SWAMP THERE WAS OF COURSE NO MORE CHANCE OF RINGING IT IN SUCH WISE AS TO BREAK IT
WHILE THE PAIR WERE TRAVELING TOGETHER KAJIWARA ONE DAY FOUND HIMSELF IN GREAT STRAITS FOR WANT OF MONEY AND UMEGAE REMEMBERING THE TRADITION OF THE BELL OF MUGEN TOOK A BASIN OF BRONZE AND MENTALLY REPRESENTING IT TO BE THE BELL BEAT UPON IT UNTIL SHE BROKE IT
CRYING OUT AT THE SAME TIME FOR THREE HUNDRED PIECES OF GOLD A GUEST OF THE INN WHERE THE PAIR WERE STOPPING
AFTERWARDS A SONG WAS MADE ABOUT UMEGAE'S BASIN OF BRONZE AND THAT SONG IS SUNG BY DANCING GIRLS EVEN TO THIS DAY UMEGAE NO CHOZUBACHI TATAITE
BECAME GREAT AND MANY PEOPLE FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF UMEGAE THEREBY HOPING TO EMULATE HER LUCK
BUT A LITTLE BEFORE MIDNIGHT HE WAS ROUSED FROM SLEEP BY A SOUND OF LOUD WEEPING IN THE NEXT APARTMENT PRESENTLY THE SLIDING SCREENS WERE GENTLY PUSHED APART AND A YOUNG MAN CARRYING A LIGHTED LANTERN ENTERED THE ROOM RESPECTFULLY SALUTED HIM AND SAID
AS IT IS I SHALL PERFORM THE SERVICE AFTER YOU HAVE GONE AWAY AND I SHALL STAY BY THE BODY UNTIL MORNING I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY YOUR WORDS ABOUT THE DANGER OF STAYING HERE ALONE
BY THE RULE OF OUR VILLAGE NONE OF US CAN STAY HERE AFTER MIDNIGHT WE BEG KIND SIR THAT YOU WILL TAKE EVERY CARE OF YOUR HONORABLE BODY WHILE WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTEND UPON YOU AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO HEAR OR SEE ANYTHING STRANGE DURING OUR ABSENCE PLEASE TELL US OF THE MATTER WHEN WE RETURN IN THE MORNING
THE PRIEST WHO YESTERDAY EVENING DIRECTED ME TO THIS VILLAGE ANSWERED MUSO I CALLED AT HIS ANJITSU ON THE HILL YONDER HE REFUSED ME LODGING BUT TOLD ME THE WAY HERE THE LISTENERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AS IN ASTONISHMENT
BUT AS HE HAD NEVER SOUGHT DISTINCTION FOR HIS OWN SAKE ALONE AND AS HIS HEART REMAINED TRUE TO HIS FORMER LORD HE PREFERRED TO GIVE UP THE WORLD SO HE CUT OFF HIS HAIR AND BECAME A TRAVELING PRIEST TAKING THE BUDDHIST NAME OF KWAIRYO
AS IN OTHER YEARS HE HAD LAUGHED AT PERIL SO NOW ALSO HE SCORNED DANGER
HE HAD ALWAYS WELCOMED DISCOMFORT AND EVEN A BARE ROCK WAS FOR HIM A GOOD BED WHEN NOTHING BETTER COULD BE FOUND AND THE ROOT OF A PINE TREE AN EXCELLENT PILLOW HIS BODY WAS IRON AND HE NEVER TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT DEWS OR RAIN OR FROST OR SNOW
SCARCELY HAD HE LAIN DOWN WHEN A MAN CAME ALONG THE ROAD CARRYING AN AXE AND A GREAT BUNDLE OF CHOPPED WOOD THIS WOODCUTTER HALTED ON SEEING KWAIRYO LYING DOWN
AS FOR LONESOME PLACES I LIKE THEM THEY ARE SUITABLE FOR MEDITATION I AM ACCUSTOMED TO SLEEPING IN THE OPEN AIR AND I HAVE LEARNED NEVER TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT MY LIFE
THOUGH NOW LIVING AS YOU FIND ME I WAS ONCE A PERSON OF SOME DISTINCTION MY STORY IS THE STORY OF A RUINED LIFE RUINED BY MY OWN FAULT I USED TO BE IN THE SERVICE OF A DAIMYO AND MY RANK IN THAT SERVICE WAS NOT INCONSIDERABLE
THEN FROM BEHIND A TRUNK HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE HEADS ALL FIVE OF THEM FLITTING ABOUT AND CHATTING AS THEY FLITTED THEY WERE EATING WORMS AND INSECTS WHICH THEY FOUND ON THE GROUND OR AMONG THE TREES
PRESENTLY THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI STOPPED EATING AND SAID AH THAT TRAVELING PRIEST WHO CAME TO NIGHT HOW FAT ALL HIS BODY IS WHEN WE SHALL HAVE EATEN HIM OUR BELLIES WILL BE WELL FILLED I WAS FOOLISH TO TALK TO HIM AS I DID
HE HAS TAKEN THE BODY OF OUR ARUJI AND I DO NOT KNOW WHERE HE HAS PUT IT AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI DISTINCTLY VISIBLE IN THE MOONLIGHT ASSUMED A FRIGHTFUL ASPECT ITS EYES OPENED MONSTROUSLY ITS HAIR STOOD UP BRISTLING AND ITS TEETH GNASHED
SINCE MY BODY HAS BEEN MOVED TO REJOIN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THEN I MUST DIE AND ALL THROUGH THE WORK OF THAT PRIEST
AND WAS SEEN MAKING HASTY STEPS TOWARDS THE LOCUSTS THERE WAS THAT IN THE AIR OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WHICH BESPOKE DISTRESS OF AN UNUSUAL NATURE AND THE KIND HEARTED MISTRESS OF THE LOCUSTS OPENED THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WITH THE BENEVOLENT INTENTION OF SOOTHING A GRIEF
HE DIED ABOUT TWO HOURS AND TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE COCK CROWED AS NEAR AS WE CAN SAY SHE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE PHYSICIAN WHO APPROACHING INQUIRED WITH MUCH INTEREST THE NATURE OF THE DISORDER GLANCING HER EYE OVER THE FIGURE OF THIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE KATY INSTINCTIVELY ADJUSTING HER DRESS
PIERCING EYES LOWERING AT HER THROUGH HIS THICK BROWS IN SILENCE PERHAPS THIS GENTLEMAN KNOWS HE SEEMS TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN MY STORY MADAM SAID THE TROOPER BOWING VERY LOW BOTH YOU AND THE TALE ARE EXTREMELY INTERESTING KATY SMILED INVOLUNTARILY
UNDER MINE ANSWERED KATY WITH AN AIR OF A LITTLE IMPORTANCE AND CARE THROWN AWAY I MAY WELL CALL IT FOR HARVEY IS QUITE TOO DESPISABLE TO BE ANY SORT OF COMPENSATION AT PRESENT THE MUTUAL IGNORANCE OF EACH OTHER'S MEANING MADE VERY LITTLE INTERRUPTION TO THE DIALOGUE
IT WAS ALWAYS SAID OF ME THAT I WANTED NOTHING BUT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE QUITE A PHYSICIAN MYSELF SO LONG AS BEFORE I CAME TO LIVE WITH HARVEY'S FATHER THEY CALLED ME THE PETTICOAT DOCTOR MORE TRUE THAN CIVIL I DARE SAY RETURNED THE SURGEON LOSING SIGHT OF THE WOMAN'S CHARACTER IN HIS ADMIRATION OF HER RESPECT FOR THE HEALING ART
HARVEY IS AS OBSTINATE ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS A DUMB BEAST ONE WOULD THINK THE CARE I TOOK OF HIS BEDRIDDEN FATHER MIGHT LEARN HIM BETTER THAN TO DESPISE GOOD NURSING BUT SOME DAY HE MAY KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WANT A CAREFUL WOMAN IN HIS HOUSE THOUGH NOW I AM SURE HE IS TOO DESPISABLE HIMSELF TO HAVE A HOUSE
THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATED A MOMENT AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND ALL THAT THE SURGEON EXPRESSED YET SHE FELT IT WAS BOTH COMPLIMENTARY AND KIND THEREFORE SUPPRESSING HER NATURAL FLOW OF LANGUAGE A LITTLE SHE REPLIED
WHAT SAID THE SURGEON INTERRUPTING HER DOES HE AFFECT TO DESPISE THE NEEDLE BUT IT IS MY LOT TO MEET WITH MEN DAILY WHO ARE EQUALLY PERVERSE AND WHO SHOW A STILL MORE CULPABLE DISRESPECT FOR THE INFORMATION THAT FLOWS FROM THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE
AND DOCTOR SITGREAVES REMOVED ALL FURTHER APPREHENSIONS BY CONFIDENTLY PRONOUNCING THAT HE WOULD BE A WELL MAN WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
HE BREAKFASTED IN HIS OWN ROOM AND NOTWITHSTANDING CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT SMILES OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE
NAY MY DEAR SITGREAVES SAID THE YOUTH TAKING HIS HAND YOU SEE THERE IS NO FEVER ABOUT ME LOOK IS THERE ANY OF JACK LAWTON'S HOARFROST ON MY TONGUE NO INDEED SAID THE SURGEON CLAPPING A SPOON IN THE MOUTH OF THE OTHER FORCING IT OPEN AND LOOKING DOWN HIS THROAT AS IF DISPOSED TO VISIT THE INTERIOR IN PERSON
IF ANYONE INTERFERES WITH MY PATIENTS CRIED THE DOCTOR HASTILY I WILL TEACH THEM SPIRIT OR NO SPIRIT WHAT IT IS TO MEDDLE WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CONCERNS TUT MY DEAR FELLOW THERE WAS NO INTERFERENCE MADE NOR ANY INTENDED SEE EXHIBITING THE BANDAGES
AS HE INQUIRED WITH A BREVITY THAT WOULD HAVE HONORED LIEUTENANT MASON HAD IT PETTICOATS GEORGE I SAW NOTHING BUT ITS HEAVENLY EYES ITS BLOOM ITS MAJESTIC STEP ITS GRACE REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN WITH RATHER MORE ARDOR THAN HIS SURGEON THOUGHT CONSISTENT WITH HIS DEBILITATED CONDITION
THE MAJOR CONSIDERATE DUNWOODIE MURMURED THE EXHAUSTED YOUTH SINKING AGAIN ON HIS PILLOW WHERE THE COMMANDS OF HIS ATTENDANT COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN SILENT EVEN CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN RECEIVED WITH MANY AND COURTEOUS INQUIRIES AFTER THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH
HIS CASE YOUNG LADY EXCEEDS MY ART TO HEAL AND I TAKE IT SIR HENRY CLINTON IS THE BEST ADVISER HE CAN APPLY TO THOUGH MAJOR DUNWOODIE HAS MADE THE COMMUNICATION WITH HIS LEECH RATHER DIFFICULT FRANCES SMILED BUT AVERTED HER FACE WHILE SARAH MOVED WITH THE GRACE OF AN OFFENDED JUNO FROM THE APARTMENT
HER OWN ROOM HOWEVER AFFORDED HER BUT LITTLE RELIEF AND IN PASSING THROUGH THE LONG GALLERY THAT COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OF THE CHAMBERS OF THE BUILDING SHE NOTICED THE DOOR OF SINGLETON'S ROOM TO BE OPEN THE WOUNDED YOUTH SEEMED SLEEPING AND WAS ALONE
AND POSSIBLY DREAMING THAT THESE LITTLE FEMININE OFFICES WERE PERFORMED FOR ANOTHER HER NATURAL BLOOM WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE INSINUATION OF THE SURGEON NOR WAS THE LUSTER OF HER EYE IN ANY DEGREE DIMINISHED THE SOUND OF THE APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS OF SITGREAVES HASTENED HER RETREAT DOWN A PRIVATE STAIRWAY TO THE SIDE OF HER SISTER
BUT I THINK MISTER DUNWOODIE HAS TAKEN A LIBERTY THAT EXCEEDS THE RIGHTS OF CONSANGUINITY HE HAS MADE OUR FATHER'S HOUSE A HOSPITAL WE OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT NONE OF THE PATIENTS IT CONTAINS ARE DEARER TO US YOUR BROTHER IS ONE TRUE TRUE INTERRUPTED FRANCES BLUSHING TO THE EYES
BUT HE LEAVES HIS ROOM AND THINKS HIS WOUND LIGHTLY PURCHASED BY THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH HIS FRIENDS IF SHE ADDED WITH A TREMULOUS LIP THIS DREADFUL SUSPICION THAT IS AFFIXED TO HIS VISIT WERE REMOVED I COULD CONSIDER HIS WOUND OF LITTLE MOMENT YOU NOW HAVE THE FRUITS OF REBELLION BROUGHT HOME TO YOU
IMPELLED BY A CHARM THAT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL THE YOUTH HAD THROWN AN EARNEST LOOK AT FRANCES AS SOON AS HIS SISTER RAISED HERSELF FROM HIS ARMS AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE FIRST GLANCE AT THE LOVELY LINEAMENTS OF OUR HEROINE
WHEN THE GAZER TURNED HIS EYES FROM THE VIEW IN DISAPPOINTMENT HE SEEMED BEWILDERED RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN AWAKING FROM A DREAM AND MUSED WHERE IS DUNWOODIE ISABELLA HE SAID THE EXCELLENT FELLOW IS NEVER WEARY OF KIND ACTIONS AFTER A DAY OF SUCH SERVICE AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
HE HAS SPENT THE NIGHT IN BRINGING ME A NURSE WHOSE PRESENCE ALONE IS ABLE TO RAISE ME FROM MY COUCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE LADY'S COUNTENANCE CHANGED
BUT ISABELLA THE MEETING HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU YOU TREMBLE ISABELLA MADE NO REPLY SHE STRETCHED HER HAND TOWARDS THE TABLE WHICH HELD THE NOURISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN AND THE ATTENTIVE FRANCES COMPREHENDED HER WISHES IN A MOMENT A GLASS OF WATER IN SOME MEASURE REVIVED THE SISTER WHO WAS ENABLED TO SAY
THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES WHO IN SOME ALARM NOTICED THE INCREASE OF FEVERISH SYMPTOMS IN HIS PATIENT ENFORCED THIS MANDATE AND THE TROOPER WITHDREW TO PAY A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE TO ROANOKE WHO HAD BEEN AN EQUAL SUFFERER WITH HIMSELF IN THEIR LAST NIGHT'S SOMERSAULT
THEY WERE REPULSED YOU SAW IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO DRIVE US FROM THE WOOD AT LEAST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY MADE AN ATTACK SAID THE CAPTAIN THROWING THE REST OF HIS CLOTHES WITHIN REACH OF THE COLONEL
AND THEREFORE I SHOULD BE SORRY THAT ANY AFFAIRS OF MINE SHOULD WORRY HIM WHEREUPON THE HOUSEKEEPER SAID TELL US SENOR AT HIS MAJESTY'S COURT ARE THERE NO KNIGHTS THERE ARE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE AND PLENTY OF THEM AND IT IS RIGHT THERE SHOULD BE
NOR DO WE ONLY KNOW ENEMIES IN PICTURES BUT IN THEIR OWN REAL SHAPES AND AT ALL RISKS AND ON ALL OCCASIONS WE ATTACK THEM WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO CHILDISH POINTS OR RULES OF SINGLE COMBAT WHETHER ONE HAS OR HAS NOT A SHORTER LANCE OR SWORD
WHETHER ONE CARRIES RELICS OR ANY SECRET CONTRIVANCE ABOUT HIM WHETHER OR NOT THE SUN IS TO BE DIVIDED AND PORTIONED OUT AND OTHER NICETIES OF THE SORT THAT ARE OBSERVED IN SET COMBATS OF MAN TO MAN THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BUT I DO
I WOULD INFLICT A CHASTISEMENT UPON THEE FOR THE BLASPHEMY THOU HAST UTTERED THAT ALL THE WORLD SHOULD RING WITH WHAT CAN IT BE THAT A YOUNG HUSSY THAT HARDLY KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE A DOZEN LACE BOBBINS DARES TO WAG HER TONGUE AND CRITICISE THE HISTORIES OF KNIGHTS ERRANT
FOR HE WAS THE MOST HUMBLE MINDED AND COURTEOUS KNIGHT OF HIS TIME
I AM THEREFORE IN A MEASURE CONSTRAINED TO FOLLOW THAT ROAD
AND IT WILL BE LABOUR IN VAIN FOR YOU TO URGE ME TO RESIST WHAT HEAVEN WILLS FATE ORDAINS REASON REQUIRES AND ABOVE ALL MY OWN INCLINATION FAVOURS FOR KNOWING AS I DO THE COUNTLESS TOILS THAT ARE THE ACCOMPANIMENTS OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY
I KNOW TOO THE INFINITE BLESSINGS THAT ARE ATTAINED BY IT I KNOW THAT THE PATH OF VIRTUE IS VERY NARROW AND THE ROAD OF VICE BROAD AND SPACIOUS I KNOW THEIR ENDS AND GOALS ARE DIFFERENT FOR THE BROAD AND EASY ROAD OF VICE ENDS IN DEATH
SO THAT TO BRING HIM ROUND AGAIN EVER SO LITTLE COST ME MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED EGGS
THAT I CAN WELL BELIEVE REPLIED THE BACHELOR FOR THEY ARE SO GOOD AND SO FAT AND SO WELL BRED THAT THEY WOULD NOT SAY ONE THING FOR ANOTHER THOUGH THEY WERE TO BURST FOR IT IN SHORT THEN MISTRESS HOUSEKEEPER THAT IS ALL
REPLIED CARRASCO AND WITH THIS THE HOUSEKEEPER RETIRED
AND ARRANGE WITH HIM WHAT WILL BE TOLD IN ITS PROPER PLACE
THE ARCH WAG SAMSON CAME FORWARD AND EMBRACING HIM AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE O FLOWER OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY O SHINING LIGHT OF ARMS O HONOUR AND MIRROR OF THE SPANISH NATION
FOR I KNOW IT IS THE POSITIVE DETERMINATION OF THE SPHERES THAT SENOR DON QUIXOTE SHALL PROCEED TO PUT INTO EXECUTION HIS NEW AND LOFTY DESIGNS AND I SHOULD LAY A HEAVY BURDEN ON MY CONSCIENCE DID I NOT URGE AND PERSUADE THIS KNIGHT NOT TO KEEP THE MIGHT OF HIS STRONG ARM AND THE VIRTUE OF HIS VALIANT SPIRIT
WITH ALL THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUISITE TO MAKE A KNIGHT ERRANT'S SQUIRE BUT HEAVEN FORBID THAT TO GRATIFY MY OWN INCLINATION I SHOULD SHAKE OR SHATTER THIS PILLAR OF LETTERS AND VESSEL OF THE SCIENCES AND CUT DOWN THIS TOWERING PALM OF THE FAIR AND LIBERAL ARTS
WHO THE PANZAS FROM WHOM I AM DESCENDED WERE AND WHAT IS MORE I KNOW AND HAVE LEARNED
POURED OUT ON THE BACHELOR WERE PAST COUNTING THEY TORE THEIR HAIR THEY CLAWED THEIR FACES AND IN THE STYLE OF THE HIRED MOURNERS THAT WERE ONCE IN FASHION
SAMSON'S INTENTION IN PERSUADING HIM TO SALLY FORTH ONCE MORE WAS TO DO WHAT THE HISTORY RELATES FARTHER ON
HE HAS PROVIDED DANCERS TOO NOT ONLY SWORD BUT ALSO BELL DANCERS FOR IN HIS OWN TOWN THERE ARE THOSE WHO RING THE CHANGES AND JINGLE THE BELLS TO PERFECTION OF SHOE DANCERS I SAY NOTHING FOR OF THEM HE HAS ENGAGED A HOST BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS
HE ARRANGED A MATCH FOR HIS DAUGHTER WITH THE RICH CAMACHO
AND ABOVE ALL HANDLES A SWORD AS WELL AS THE BEST
SAY THAT TO MY WIFE SAID SANCHO WHO HAD UNTIL NOW LISTENED IN SILENCE FOR SHE WON'T HEAR OF ANYTHING BUT EACH ONE MARRYING HIS EQUAL HOLDING WITH THE PROVERB EACH EWE TO HER LIKE
AND TELL ME IS THERE ANYONE WHO CAN BOAST OF HAVING DRIVEN A NAIL INTO THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE NO FAITH AND BETWEEN A WOMAN'S YES AND NO I WOULDN'T VENTURE TO PUT THE POINT OF A PIN
AND YET THEY ARE ALL TOLEDANS PURE CORRECT
THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN BORN IN MAJALAHONDA I SAY OF DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE NOT SO AND DISCRIMINATION IS THE GRAMMAR OF GOOD LANGUAGE IF IT BE ACCOMPANIED BY PRACTICE I SIRS FOR MY SINS HAVE STUDIED CANON LAW AT SALAMANCA
IT GREW DARK BUT BEFORE THEY REACHED THE TOWN IT SEEMED TO THEM ALL AS IF THERE WAS A HEAVEN FULL OF COUNTLESS GLITTERING STARS IN FRONT OF IT THEY HEARD TOO THE PLEASANT MINGLED NOTES OF A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS FLUTES DRUMS
PSALTERIES PIPES
OTHERS SINGING OTHERS PLAYING THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS ALREADY MENTIONED
WERE FRISKING AND GAMBOLLING ALL OVER THE MEADOW
HE AWOKE AT LAST DROWSY AND LAZY AND CASTING HIS EYES ABOUT IN EVERY DIRECTION OBSERVED THERE COMES IF I DON'T MISTAKE
AND IF THAT BE SO AS NO DOUBT IT IS
OF OVER SIX GALLONS EACH AND ALL FILLED AS IT PROVED AFTERWARDS WITH GENEROUS WINES THERE WERE BESIDES PILES OF THE WHITEST BREAD LIKE THE HEAPS OF CORN ONE SEES ON THE THRESHING FLOORS
CONTEMPLATED ALL AND EVERYTHING WON HIS HEART THE FIRST TO CAPTIVATE AND TAKE HIS FANCY WERE THE POTS
A FIGHT THAT WON FRIENDS THE THING WHICH MORE NEARLY RESEMBLED OUR EARTHLY MEN THAN IT DID THE MARTIANS I HAD SEEN HELD ME PINIONED TO THE GROUND WITH ONE HUGE FOOT
SCARCELY HAD THE BLOW DESCENDED WHEN I WAS CONFRONTED WITH A NEW DANGER THE APE'S MATE RECOVERED FROM ITS FIRST SHOCK OF TERROR HAD RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF THE ENCOUNTER BY WAY OF THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING
AGAINST ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH SHOULD I REMAIN AND FIGHT HOWEVER DESPERATELY IT IS TRUE I HELD THE CUDGEL BUT WHAT COULD I DO WITH IT AGAINST HIS FOUR GREAT ARMS
EVEN SHOULD I BREAK ONE OF THEM WITH MY FIRST BLOW FOR I FIGURED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO WARD OFF THE CUDGEL HE COULD REACH OUT AND ANNIHILATE ME WITH THE OTHERS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FOR A SECOND ATTACK
IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
AS HE HAD IN MINE WITHOUT MORE ADO THEREFORE I TURNED TO MEET THE CHARGE OF THE INFURIATED BULL APE HE WAS NOW TOO CLOSE UPON ME FOR THE CUDGEL TO PROVE OF ANY EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE
MY ABSENCE HAD BEEN NOTED BY SOLA ON HER AWAKENING AND SHE HAD QUICKLY INFORMED TARS TARKAS WHO HAD SET OUT IMMEDIATELY WITH A HANDFUL OF WARRIORS TO SEARCH FOR ME AS THEY HAD APPROACHED THE LIMITS OF THE CITY
THIS ENCOUNTER TOGETHER WITH MY SET TO WITH THE MARTIAN WARRIOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND MY FEATS OF JUMPING PLACED ME UPON A HIGH PINNACLE IN THEIR REGARD EVIDENTLY DEVOID OF ALL THE FINER SENTIMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP
LOVE OR AFFECTION THESE PEOPLE FAIRLY WORSHIP PHYSICAL PROWESS AND BRAVERY AND NOTHING IS TOO GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADORATION AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS POSITION BY REPEATED EXAMPLES OF HIS SKILL
AND TAKING MY HAND STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER TARS TARKAS AND THE OTHER WARRIORS HAD ENTERED AND WERE STANDING OVER THE NOW RAPIDLY REVIVING BRUTE WHICH HAD SAVED MY LIFE
THEY SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN ARGUMENT AND FINALLY ONE OF THEM ADDRESSED ME BUT REMEMBERING MY IGNORANCE OF HIS LANGUAGE TURNED BACK TO TARS TARKAS WHO WITH A WORD AND GESTURE GAVE SOME COMMAND TO THE FELLOW
AND SOLA GRASPING ME TIGHTLY BY THE ARM I HAD AT LEAST TWO FRIENDS ON MARS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WATCHED OVER ME WITH MOTHERLY SOLICITUDE AND A DUMB BRUTE WHICH AS I LATER CAME TO KNOW
AND DEPENDING FROM THESE A NUMBER OF DRIED HUMAN HANDS HIS REFERENCE TO THE GREAT GAMES OF WHICH I HAD HEARD SO MUCH WHILE AMONG THE THARKS CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD BUT JUMPED FROM PURGATORY INTO GEHENNA
WHO PROVED TO BE THE JEDDAK OF THE HORDES OF WARHOON LIKE THE JED WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY SCARRED AND ALSO DECORATED WITH THE BREASTPLATE OF HUMAN SKULLS AND DRIED DEAD HANDS
WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
HE ENTIRELY OMITTED THE USUAL FORMAL SALUTATION AS WE ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THE JEDDAK AND AS HE PUSHED ME ROUGHLY BEFORE THE RULER HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD AND MENACING VOICE
WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
I NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN TWO GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS BATTLE WITH NATURE'S WEAPONS AND THE EXHIBITION OF ANIMAL FEROCITY WHICH ENSUED WAS AS FEARFUL A THING AS THE MOST DISORDERED IMAGINATION COULD PICTURE
THEY ARE A SMALLER HORDE THAN THE THARKS BUT MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS
AND THAT MY MIND DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE TERRORS OF THAT INKY BLACKNESS HAS BEEN A WONDER TO ME EVER SINCE THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH CREEPING CRAWLING THINGS COLD SINUOUS BODIES PASSED OVER ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
SO WITH THE CUNNING OF A MADMAN I BACKED INTO THE FAR CORNER OF MY CELL WHEN NEXT I HEARD HIM APPROACHING
HE SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR STONE DEAD LAUGHING AND CHATTERING LIKE THE IDIOT I WAS FAST BECOMING
THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
AND SOON MY FIERCE ESCORT WAS RIDING ACROSS THE GARDENS OF THE JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS WE APPROACHED THE PALACE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO THE BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THAN KOSIS
AND SO I CAME CLOSE AND PEERED WITHIN AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS SAT THAN KOSIS AND HIS CONSORT
SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER
RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
AND WITH HIM MY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE WOMAN I LOVED MY BLADE WAS SWINGING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AS I SOUGHT TO PARRY THE THRUSTS AND CUTS OF MY OPPONENTS TWO I HAD DISARMED AND ONE WAS DOWN
NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE
WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
THE COUNCIL OF BUCCANEERS HAD LASTED SOME TIME WHEN ONE OF THEM RE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND WITH A REPETITION OF THE SAME SALUTE WHICH HAD IN MY EYES AN IRONICAL AIR BEGGED FOR A MOMENT'S LOAN OF THE TORCH SILVER BRIEFLY AGREED
THE EMBERS OF THE GREAT FIRE HAD SO FAR BURNED THEMSELVES OUT AND NOW GLOWED SO LOW AND DUSKILY THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHY THESE CONSPIRATORS DESIRED A TORCH ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE SLOPE TO THE STOCKADE THEY WERE COLLECTED IN A GROUP
HE'S SEEN HIS SLICE OF LUCK HAS DICK AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT BUT HERE THE LONG MAN WITH THE YELLOW EYES STRUCK IN
OH REPLIED GEORGE YOU DON'T BE UNDER NO KIND OF APPREHENSION WE'RE ALL SQUARE WE ARE FIRST YOU'VE MADE A HASH OF THIS CRUISE YOU'LL BE A BOLD MAN TO SAY NO TO THAT SECOND
THIRD YOU WOULDN'T LET US GO AT THEM UPON THE MARCH
DON'T IT THOUGH CRIED DICK WITH A SORT OF JOY WELL I RECKON THAT'S WORTH HAVING TOO HERE JIM HERE'S A CUR'OSITY FOR YOU SAID SILVER AND HE TOSSED ME THE PAPER
THE PRINTED SIDE HAD BEEN BLACKENED WITH WOOD ASH WHICH ALREADY BEGAN TO COME OFF AND SOIL MY FINGERS ON THE BLANK SIDE HAD BEEN WRITTEN WITH THE SAME MATERIAL THE ONE WORD DEPPOSED
HE HIMSELF SLEPT PEACEFULLY AND SNORED ALOUD YET
TWO GUINEAS ROARED MERRY SHAKING IT AT SILVER
ONE'S THE OLD CRIPPLE THAT BROUGHT US ALL HERE AND BLUNDERED US DOWN TO THIS THE OTHER'S THAT CUB THAT I MEAN TO HAVE THE HEART OF NOW MATES
AND PLAINLY MEANT TO LEAD A CHARGE BUT JUST THEN CRACK CRACK CRACK THREE MUSKET SHOTS FLASHED OUT OF THE THICKET MERRY TUMBLED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE EXCAVATION
WAS WORK NO SOUND MAN EVER EQUALLED AND SO THINKS THE DOCTOR AS IT WAS HE WAS ALREADY THIRTY YARDS BEHIND US AND ON THE VERGE OF STRANGLING WHEN WE REACHED THE BROW OF THE SLOPE DOCTOR HE HAILED SEE THERE
BEN BEN MURMURED SILVER TO THINK AS YOU'VE DONE ME THE DOCTOR SENT BACK GRAY FOR ONE OF THE PICK AXES DESERTED IN THEIR FLIGHT BY THE MUTINEERS
GIVEN HIM THE STORES FOR BEN GUNN'S CAVE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH GOATS MEAT SALTED BY HIMSELF GIVEN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO GET A CHANCE OF MOVING IN SAFETY FROM THE STOCKADE TO THE TWO POINTED HILL THERE TO BE CLEAR OF MALARIA
AND LEAVING THE SQUIRE TO GUARD THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN GRAY AND THE MAROON AND STARTED MAKING THE DIAGONAL ACROSS THE ISLAND TO BE AT HAND BESIDE THE PINE SOON HOWEVER HE SAW THAT OUR PARTY HAD THE START OF HIM AND BEN GUNN BEING FLEET OF FOOT
HAD BEEN DISPATCHED IN FRONT TO DO HIS BEST ALONE THEN IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORK UPON THE SUPERSTITIONS OF HIS FORMER SHIPMATES
AND A FIGURE STANDING BY IT LEANING ON A MUSKET IT WAS THE SQUIRE AND WE WAVED A HANDKERCHIEF AND GAVE HIM THREE CHEERS IN WHICH THE VOICE OF SILVER JOINED AS HEARTILY AS ANY THREE MILES FARTHER JUST INSIDE THE MOUTH OF NORTH INLET
WHAT SHOULD WE MEET BUT THE HISPANIOLA CRUISING BY HERSELF THE LAST FLOOD HAD LIFTED HER AND HAD THERE BEEN MUCH WIND OR A STRONG TIDE CURRENT AS IN THE SOUTHERN ANCHORAGE WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND HER MORE OR FOUND HER STRANDED BEYOND HELP
AND WHAT A MEAL IT WAS WITH BEN GUNN'S SALTED GOAT AND SOME DELICACIES AND A BOTTLE OF OLD WINE FROM THE HISPANIOLA NEVER I AM SURE WERE PEOPLE GAYER OR HAPPIER
THEREFORE THE WORK WAS PUSHED ON BRISKLY GRAY AND BEN GUNN CAME AND WENT WITH THE BOAT WHILE THE REST DURING THEIR ABSENCES
NEARLY EVERY VARIETY OF MONEY IN THE WORLD MUST I THINK HAVE FOUND A PLACE IN THAT COLLECTION AND FOR NUMBER I AM SURE THEY WERE LIKE AUTUMN LEAVES SO THAT MY BACK ACHED WITH STOOPING AND MY FINGERS WITH SORTING THEM OUT
A COUNCIL WAS HELD AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE MUST DESERT THEM ON THE ISLAND TO THE HUGE GLEE I MUST SAY OF BEN GUNN AND WITH THE STRONG APPROVAL OF GRAY WE LEFT A GOOD STOCK OF POWDER AND SHOT THE BULK OF THE SALT GOAT
LEAPT TO HIS FEET WITH A HOARSE CRY WHIPPED HIS MUSKET TO HIS SHOULDER AND SENT A SHOT WHISTLING OVER SILVER'S HEAD
AND AS IT WAS WHAT WITH BAFFLING WINDS AND A COUPLE OF FRESH GALES WE WERE ALL WORN OUT BEFORE WE REACHED IT IT WAS JUST AT SUNDOWN WHEN WE CAST ANCHOR IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL LAND LOCKED GULF
MARRIED BESIDES AND THE FATHER OF A FAMILY AS FOR BEN GUNN HE GOT A THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HE SPENT OR LOST IN THREE WEEKS OR TO BE MORE EXACT IN NINETEEN DAYS FOR HE WAS BACK BEGGING ON THE TWENTIETH
AND THE ARMS STILL LIE FOR ALL THAT I KNOW WHERE FLINT BURIED THEM AND CERTAINLY THEY SHALL LIE THERE FOR ME
AND THE WORST DREAMS THAT EVER I HAVE ARE WHEN I HEAR THE SURF BOOMING ABOUT ITS COASTS OR START UPRIGHT IN BED WITH THE SHARP VOICE OF CAPTAIN FLINT STILL RINGING IN MY EARS
I WOULD HERE WILLINGLY HAVE PROCEEDED TO EXHIBIT THE WHOLE CHAIN OF TRUTHS WHICH I DEDUCED FROM THESE PRIMARY BUT AS WITH A VIEW TO THIS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY NOW TO TREAT OF MANY QUESTIONS
AND TO ACCEPT AS TRUE NOTHING THAT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME MORE CLEAR AND CERTAIN THAN THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE GEOMETERS HAD FORMERLY APPEARED AND YET I VENTURE TO STATE THAT NOT ONLY HAVE I FOUND MEANS
BUT LIKE THE PAINTERS WHO FINDING THEMSELVES UNABLE TO REPRESENT EQUALLY WELL ON A PLAIN SURFACE ALL THE DIFFERENT FACES OF A SOLID BODY SELECT ONE OF THE CHIEF ON WHICH ALONE THEY MAKE THE LIGHT FALL AND THROWING THE REST INTO THE SHADE
MATTER SUFFICIENT TO COMPOSE ONE AND WERE TO AGITATE VARIOUSLY AND CONFUSEDLY THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS MATTER SO THAT THERE RESULTED A CHAOS AS DISORDERED AS THE POETS EVER FEIGNED
AS TO PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF HEAVENS HOW IN THE MEANTIME SOME OF ITS PARTS MUST COMPOSE AN EARTH AND SOME PLANETS AND COMETS AND OTHERS A SUN AND FIXED STARS AND MAKING A DIGRESSION AT THIS STAGE ON THE SUBJECT OF LIGHT
AND ALL THE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF THESE HEAVENS AND STARS SO THAT I THOUGHT I HAD SAID ENOUGH RESPECTING THEM TO SHOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING OBSERVABLE IN THE HEAVENS OR STARS OF OUR SYSTEM THAT MUST NOT OR AT LEAST MAY NOT APPEAR PRECISELY ALIKE IN THOSE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH I DESCRIBED
I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT FIRE WHICH PRODUCES LIGHT I SPARED NO PAINS TO SET FORTH ALL THAT PERTAINS TO ITS NATURE THE MANNER OF ITS PRODUCTION AND SUPPORT AND TO EXPLAIN HOW HEAT IS SOMETIMES FOUND WITHOUT LIGHT AND LIGHT WITHOUT HEAT
BUT THIS IS CERTAIN AND AN OPINION COMMONLY RECEIVED AMONG THEOLOGIANS THAT THE ACTION BY WHICH HE NOW SUSTAINS IT IS THE SAME WITH THAT BY WHICH HE ORIGINALLY CREATED IT
FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF INANIMATE BODIES AND PLANTS I PASSED TO ANIMALS AND PARTICULARLY TO MAN
NATURE MUST PRODUCE THEM I REMAINED SATISFIED WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT GOD FORMED THE BODY OF MAN WHOLLY LIKE TO ONE OF OURS AS WELL IN THE EXTERNAL SHAPE OF THE MEMBERS AS IN THE INTERNAL CONFORMATION OF THE ORGANS
WILL AFFORD THE MEANS OF READILY DETERMINING WHAT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF ALL THE REST
WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL RECEPTACLE OF THE BLOOD AND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AS IT WERE OF WHICH ALL THE OTHER VEINS IN THE BODY ARE BRANCHES AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN VENA ARTERIOSA INAPPROPRIATELY SO DENOMINATED
WHICH ARRANGED IN A MANNER EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE FORMER READILY PERMIT THE BLOOD CONTAINED IN THIS CAVITY TO PASS INTO THE LUNGS BUT HINDER THAT CONTAINED IN THE LUNGS FROM RETURNING TO THIS CAVITY AND IN LIKE MANNER
FROM THE VERY ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WHICH MAY BE OBSERVED IN THE HEART BY THE EYE ALONE AND FROM THE HEAT WHICH MAY BE FELT WITH THE FINGERS AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE BLOOD AS LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE AS DOES THE MOTION OF A CLOCK FROM THE POWER
THE SITUATION AND SHAPE OF ITS COUNTERWEIGHTS AND WHEELS BUT IF IT BE ASKED HOW IT HAPPENS THAT THE BLOOD IN THE VEINS FLOWING IN THIS WAY CONTINUALLY INTO THE HEART IS NOT EXHAUSTED
THE OPENING VERY TIGHT FOR IT IS MANIFEST THAT THE TIE MODERATELY STRAIGHTENED WHILE ADEQUATE TO HINDER THE BLOOD ALREADY IN THE ARM FROM RETURNING TOWARDS THE HEART BY THE VEINS CANNOT ON THAT ACCOUNT PREVENT NEW BLOOD
IS THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE MOTION OF THE BLOOD THUS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE BLOOD WHICH FLOWS FROM THE VEINS AND THAT FROM THE ARTERIES CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THIS
AND MORE VIVID AND WARMER IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE HEART IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IN THE ARTERIES THAN IT WAS A SHORT TIME BEFORE PASSING INTO EITHER IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IT WAS IN THE VEINS
SUFFICIENTLY SHOWS THAT THE BLOOD IS IMPELLED AGAINST THEM WITH MORE FORCE THAN AGAINST THE VEINS AND WHY SHOULD THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART
AND THAT IN CHILDREN WHO CANNOT USE THEM WHILE IN THE WOMB
WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IT IS DISTILLED BY PASSING AND REPASSING THROUGH THE HEART PERHAPS MORE THAN ONE OR TWO HUNDRED TIMES IN A DAY
IN THE MOST DIRECT LINES AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MECHANICS WHICH ARE THE SAME WITH THOSE OF NATURE WHEN MANY OBJECTS TEND AT ONCE TO THE SAME POINT
WHICH FLOW FORTH FROM THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART AND TEND TOWARDS THE BRAIN THE WEAKER AND LESS AGITATED PARTS MUST NECESSARILY BE DRIVEN ASIDE FROM THAT POINT BY THE STRONGER WHICH ALONE IN THIS WAY REACH IT
TO GIVE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS CONTAINED IN IT THE POWER TO MOVE THE MEMBERS AS WHEN WE SEE HEADS SHORTLY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK OFF STILL MOVE AND BITE THE EARTH ALTHOUGH NO LONGER ANIMATED WHAT CHANGES MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE BRAIN TO PRODUCE
MUSCLES NERVES ARTERIES VEINS AND OTHER PARTS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE BODY OF EACH ANIMAL SUCH PERSONS WILL LOOK UPON THIS BODY AS A MACHINE MADE BY THE HANDS OF GOD WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER ARRANGED
AND COULD SURPASS US IN ALL THINGS ON THE CONTRARY IT RATHER PROVES THAT THEY ARE DESTITUTE OF REASON AND THAT IT IS NATURE WHICH ACTS IN THEM ACCORDING TO THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR ORGANS THUS IT IS SEEN THAT A CLOCK COMPOSED ONLY OF WHEELS AND WEIGHTS
BUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE JOINED AND UNITED MORE CLOSELY TO THE BODY IN ORDER TO HAVE SENSATIONS AND APPETITES SIMILAR TO OURS AND THUS CONSTITUTE A REAL MAN
AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT AFTER THIS LIFE WE HAVE NOTHING TO HOPE FOR OR FEAR MORE THAN FLIES AND ANTS IN PLACE OF WHICH WHEN WE KNOW HOW FAR THEY DIFFER WE MUCH BETTER COMPREHEND THE REASONS WHICH ESTABLISH
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX I WILL GIVE HERE AS MUCH OF IT AS CONCERNS THE PUBLIC I WISH YOU TO ACCEPT AS A GIFT FROM ME GIVEN YOU NOW THE ACCOMPANYING PAGES WHICH CONTAIN A MEMOIR OF MY LIFE
THAT HE HAD GIVEN UP HUNTING BUT HE STILL KEPT TWO HORSES FOR SUCH RIDING AS MAY BE HAD IN OR ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF LONDON HE CONTINUED TO RIDE TO THE END OF HIS LIFE HE LIKED THE EXERCISE AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE DISTRESSED HIM NOT TO HAVE HAD A HORSE IN HIS STABLE
AN EYE FOR AN EYE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE COUSIN HENRY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THACKERAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE DUKE'S CHILDREN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY LIFE OF CICERO
THE LANDLEAGUERS WHICH AS STATED ABOVE WAS UNFINISHED WHEN HE DIED THIS BOOK WAS A CAUSE OF ANXIETY TO HIM HE COULD NOT RID HIS MIND OF THE FACT THAT HE HAD A STORY ALREADY IN THE COURSE OF PUBLICATION BUT WHICH HE HAD NOT YET COMPLETED
IN NO OTHER CASE EXCEPT FRAMLEY PARSONAGE DID MY FATHER PUBLISH EVEN THE FIRST NUMBER OF ANY NOVEL BEFORE HE HAD FULLY COMPLETED THE WHOLE TALE
CHAPTER ONE MY EDUCATION
I WAS BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN IN KEPPEL STREET RUSSELL SQUARE AND WHILE A BABY WAS CARRIED DOWN TO HARROW WHERE MY FATHER HAD BUILT A HOUSE ON A LARGE FARM
BUT AT ANY RATE AS OTHER DAY BOARDERS I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THEY WERE WELL TREATED BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO THE IGNOMINY WHICH I ENDURED
I WAS ONLY SEVEN AND I THINK THAT BOYS AT SEVEN ARE NOW SPARED AMONG THEIR MORE CONSIDERATE SENIORS I WAS NEVER SPARED AND WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO RUN TO AND FRO BETWEEN OUR HOUSE AND THE SCHOOL
MY TWO ELDER BROTHERS HAD GONE THERE AND THE YOUNGER HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY BEING ALREADY SUPPOSED TO HAVE LOST HIS CHANCE OF NEW COLLEGE IT HAD BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT AMBITIONS OF MY FATHER'S LIFE THAT HIS THREE SONS WHO LIVED TO GO TO WINCHESTER
BUT MY OTHER BROTHER DIED EARLY WHILE I WAS AT WINCHESTER MY FATHER'S AFFAIRS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE HE GAVE UP HIS PRACTICE AT THE BAR AND UNFORTUNATE THAT HE WAS TOOK ANOTHER FARM
I HAVE SEEN IT SINCE IN THE TOWN OF CINCINNATI A SORRY BUILDING BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN IMPOSING EDIFICE MY MOTHER WENT FIRST WITH MY SISTERS AND SECOND BROTHER
HANG A LITTLE BOY FOR STEALING APPLES HE USED TO SAY AND OTHER LITTLE BOYS WILL NOT STEAL APPLES THE DOCTRINE WAS ALREADY EXPLODED ELSEWHERE BUT HE STUCK TO IT WITH CONSERVATIVE ENERGY THE RESULT WAS THAT AS
THERE WAS OFTEN A DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH ME ON THIS OCCASION MY AMUSEMENT CONSISTED IN WANDERING ABOUT AMONG THOSE OLD DESERTED BUILDINGS AND IN READING SHAKESPEARE OUT OF A BI COLUMNED EDITION
THE BATTELS FOR THE LAST HALF YEAR HAD NOT BEEN REPAID AND HE URGED HIS OWN UNWILLINGNESS TO ADVANCE THE MONEY THE LOSS OF A SHILLING A WEEK WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH EVEN THOUGH POCKET MONEY FROM OTHER SOURCES NEVER REACHED ME
WHEN I HAD BEEN AT WINCHESTER SOMETHING OVER THREE YEARS MY FATHER RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND TOOK ME AWAY WHETHER THIS WAS DONE BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OR BECAUSE MY CHANCE OF NEW COLLEGE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE PASSED AWAY
AT HARROW WEALD BUT IN THE PARISH AND FROM THIS HOUSE I WAS AGAIN SENT TO THAT SCHOOL AS A DAY BOARDER LET THOSE WHO KNOW WHAT IS THE USUAL APPEARANCE AND WHAT THE USUAL APPURTENANCES OF A BOY AT SUCH A SCHOOL
THE INDIGNITIES I ENDURED ARE NOT TO BE DESCRIBED AS I LOOK BACK IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL HANDS WERE TURNED AGAINST ME THOSE OF MASTERS AS WELL AS BOYS I WAS ALLOWED TO JOIN IN NO PLAYS
BUT ONE CANNOT MAKE A STAND AGAINST THE ACERBITIES OF THREE HUNDRED TYRANTS WITHOUT A MORAL COURAGE OF WHICH AT THAT TIME I POSSESSED NONE I KNOW THAT I SKULKED AND WAS ODIOUS TO THE EYES OF THOSE I ADMIRED AND ENVIED
I WISH I COULD GIVE SOME ADEQUATE PICTURE OF THE GLOOM OF THAT FARMHOUSE MY ELDER BROTHER TOM AS I MUST CALL HIM IN MY NARRATIVE THOUGH THE WORLD I THINK KNOWS HIM BEST AS ADOLPHUS WAS AT OXFORD
UNDER CRUSHING DISADVANTAGES WITH FEW OR NO BOOKS OF REFERENCE WITH IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO NO LIBRARY HE WORKED AT HIS MOST UNGRATEFUL TASK WITH UNFLAGGING INDUSTRY WHEN HE DIED
HE COULD NOT GIVE HIS TIME TO TEACH ME FOR EVERY HOUR THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE FIELDS WAS DEVOTED TO HIS MONKS AND NUNS BUT HE WOULD REQUIRE ME TO SIT AT A TABLE WITH LEXICON AND GRADUS BEFORE ME
IN THE OLD HOUSE WERE THE TWO FIRST VOLUMES OF COOPER'S NOVEL CALLED THE PRAIRIE A RELIC PROBABLY A DISHONEST RELIC OF SOME SUBSCRIPTION TO HOOKHAM'S LIBRARY OTHER BOOKS OF THE KIND THERE WAS NONE
AT THE SCHOOL AT SUNBURY THERE WAS CERTAINLY A WRITING MASTER AND A FRENCH MASTER THE LATTER WAS AN EXTRA AND I NEVER HAD EXTRAS
I SUPPOSE I MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE WRITING MASTER'S CLASS BUT THOUGH I CAN CALL TO MIND THE MAN I CANNOT CALL TO MIND HIS FERULE IT WAS BY THEIR FERULES THAT I ALWAYS KNEW THEM AND THEY ME
AND I HAVE OFTEN BOASTED THAT I OBTAINED THEM ALL LOOKING BACK OVER HALF A CENTURY
THEN TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD WITH HER LIPS AS IF TO FEEL WHETHER SHE WAS FEVERISH AND FINALLY KISSED HER YOU ARE COLD
AND SHE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND OPENED IT THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW THE MOANS OF THE ADJUTANT COULD BE HEARD MORE DISTINCTLY SHE PUT HER HEAD OUT INTO THE DAMP NIGHT AIR AND THE COUNTESS SAW HER SLIM NECK SHAKING WITH SOBS AND THROBBING AGAINST THE WINDOW FRAME
I'LL LIE DOWN AT ONCE SAID NATASHA AND BEGAN HURRIEDLY UNDRESSING TUGGING AT THE TAPES OF HER PETTICOAT WHEN SHE HAD THROWN OFF HER DRESS AND PUT ON A DRESSING JACKET
COULD STILL BE HEARD FOR A LONG TIME NATASHA LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THE SOUNDS THAT REACHED HER FROM INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE ROOM AND DID NOT MOVE FIRST SHE HEARD HER MOTHER PRAYING AND SIGHING AND THE CREAKING OF HER BED UNDER HER
AFTER A SHORT SILENCE THE COUNTESS SPOKE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME NO ONE REPLIED SOON AFTER THAT NATASHA HEARD HER MOTHER'S EVEN BREATHING NATASHA DID NOT MOVE THOUGH HER LITTLE BARE FOOT
ON WHICH SOMETHING WAS LYING STOOD A TALLOW CANDLE WITH A LONG THICK AND SMOLDERING WICK FROM THE MOMENT SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT MORNING OF PRINCE ANDREW'S WOUND AND HIS PRESENCE THERE NATASHA HAD RESOLVED TO SEE HIM
WERE IN THE DOCTOR'S OPINION SURE TO CARRY HIM OFF BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE ATE WITH PLEASURE A PIECE OF BREAD WITH SOME TEA AND THE DOCTOR NOTICED THAT HIS TEMPERATURE WAS LOWER HE HAD REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS THAT MORNING THE FIRST NIGHT AFTER THEY LEFT MOSCOW
HAD BEEN FAIRLY WARM AND HE HAD REMAINED IN THE CALECHE BUT AT MYTISHCHI THE WOUNDED MAN HIMSELF ASKED TO BE TAKEN OUT AND GIVEN SOME TEA THE PAIN CAUSED BY HIS REMOVAL INTO THE HUT HAD MADE HIM GROAN ALOUD AND AGAIN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS
HE KEPT ASKING THEM TO GET HIM THE BOOK AND PUT IT UNDER HIM WHAT TROUBLE WOULD IT BE TO YOU HE SAID
THOUGHTS THOUGH NOW VAGUE AND INDEFINITE AGAIN POSSESSED HIS SOUL HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD NOW A NEW SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND THAT THIS HAPPINESS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE GOSPELS THAT WAS WHY HE ASKED FOR A COPY OF THEM
HIS MIND WAS NOT IN A NORMAL STATE A HEALTHY MAN USUALLY THINKS OF FEELS AND REMEMBERS INNUMERABLE THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT HAS THE POWER AND WILL TO SELECT ONE SEQUENCE OF THOUGHTS OR EVENTS ON WHICH TO FIX HIS WHOLE ATTENTION
HE THOUGHT AS HE LAY IN THE SEMIDARKNESS OF THE QUIET HUT GAZING FIXEDLY BEFORE HIM WITH FEVERISH WIDE OPEN EYES A HAPPINESS LYING BEYOND MATERIAL FORCES OUTSIDE THE MATERIAL INFLUENCES THAT ACT ON MAN
NOW AGAIN I FEEL THAT BLISS TO LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBORS
NOT AS HE HAD DONE IN THE PAST WITH NOTHING BUT HER CHARMS WHICH GAVE HIM DELIGHT BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME PICTURING TO HIMSELF HER SOUL AND HE UNDERSTOOD HER FEELINGS HER SUFFERINGS SHAME AND REMORSE
AND DELIRIUM IN WHICH SOMETHING PARTICULAR WAS HAPPENING IN THAT WORLD SOME STRUCTURE WAS STILL BEING ERECTED AND DID NOT FALL SOMETHING WAS STILL STRETCHING OUT AND THE CANDLE WITH ITS RED HALO WAS STILL BURNING
BUT HE COULD NOT AND DELIRIUM DREW HIM BACK INTO ITS DOMAIN THE SOFT WHISPERING VOICE CONTINUED ITS RHYTHMIC MURMUR SOMETHING OPPRESSED HIM AND STRETCHED OUT AND THE STRANGE FACE WAS BEFORE HIM
THOSE THAT LIVED THERE THOUGHT THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO STAY THERE AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED IT WAS IN THIS VILLAGE THAT BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS NEIGHBORS LIVED IT WAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF TOWN TOO
SUCH AS POPLARS WILLOWS AND BOX ELDERS THEY HAD DECIDED THAT IT WAS A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE THERE WAS A SMALL STREAM TOO WHICH WAS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF SWIFT RIVER
SHOULD BE FAR BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT THAT MADE A HOUSE SAFER TOO TO YOU SUCH AN IDEA MAY SEEM VERY STRANGE BUT IF YOU WERE CHASED BY AN ENEMY YOU MIGHT BE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SWIM UNDER WATER
YOU SEE THE VILLAGERS KEPT MAKING THE DAM WIDER AND SINCE IT WAS BUILT OF STICKS AND MUD THE WATER SOMETIMES WASHED BITS OF IT AWAY SO IT HAD TO BE KEPT IN REPAIR IF BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS FRIENDS HAD NEGLECTED THEIR DAM
AND WITHOUT ANY WATER TO HIDE THEIR DOORWAYS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE NO LONGER THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NO PLACE EITHER TO STORE THEIR WINTER'S FOOD FOR THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING DOWN TREES AND SAVING THE BARK AND BRANCHES TOO
AND SOME OF THE BRANCHES THEY FASTENED UNDER WATER NEAR THE DAM IT WAS JUST LIKE PUTTING GREEN THINGS INTO A REFRIGERATOR SO THEY WILL KEEP NOW YOU SEE WHY BROWNIE BEAVER WOULD NO MORE HAVE THOUGHT OF BUILDING HIS HOUSE ON DRY LAND
HE LIGHTED RIGHT ON TOP OF BROWNIE BEAVER'S HOUSE AND CALLED PAPER DOWN THE CHIMNEY JUST LIKE THAT BROWNIE HAPPENED TO BE INSIDE HIS HOUSE AND IN A WONDERFULLY SHORT TIME HIS HEAD APPEARED
ABOVE THE WATER AND HE SOON CRAWLED UP BESIDE MISTER CROW WELL I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU HE TOLD MISTER CROW PETER MINK CAUGHT A MONSTROUS EEL IN THE DUCK POND ON MONDAY MISTER CROW SAID
BEING A NEWSPAPER HE THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO SAY NOTHING EXCEPT WHAT WAS NEWS NOT EVEN GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER RABBIT OF PINE RIDGE WITH HIS WIFE AND FOURTEEN CHILDREN IS VISITING HIS BROTHER MISTER JEREMIAH RABBIT
MISSUS BEAR HAD A BIRTHDAY ON WEDNESDAY AN ENJOYABLE TIME WAS HAD BY ALL EXCEPT THE PIG PIG BROWNIE BEAVER ASKED WHAT PIG THE PIG THEY ATE SAID MISTER CROW
I'LL TELL YOU ALL THE NEWS I'VE BROUGHT AND WHEN I'VE FINISHED I'LL STOP BEING A NEWSPAPER AND BE MYSELF FOR A WHILE AND THEN WE CAN TALK BUT NOT BEFORE HE INSISTED BROWNIE BEAVER NODDED HIS HEAD
FOR A FEW MOMENTS BROWNIE WAITED TO HEAR THE REST BUT A FEW MOMENTS WAS MORE THAN HE COULD ENDURE WHY DIDN'T JIMMY CUT OFF HIS TAIL BROWNIE ASKED EAGERLY THERE SAID MISTER CROW YOU'VE DONE JUST AS I TOLD YOU NOT TO
SO I SHALL NOT TELL YOU THE REST UNTIL NEXT SATURDAY YOU SEE YOU HAVE A FEW THINGS TO LEARN ABOUT TAKING A NEWSPAPER
THERE WAS GREAT REJOICING IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE IN THE POND WHEN BROWNIE BEAVER RETURNED WITH THE GOOD NEWS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE HUNTING AND FISHING AND WHEN OLD GRANDADDY BEAVER SAID THAT EVERYBODY OUGHT TO TAKE A HOLIDAY TO CELEBRATE THE OCCASION
AND BROWNIE BEAVER SAID THAT AFTER THE HOLIDAY WAS OVER HE WOULD SUGGEST THAT SOMEONE BE CHOSEN TO GO DOWN AND THANK FARMER GREEN FOR PUTTING THE NOTICE ON THE TREE THE WHOLE VILLAGE AGREED TO BROWNIE'S PROPOSAL
AND ANOTHER IN WHICH EACH PERSON WHO TOOK PART HAD TO STAY BENEATH THE SURFACE AS LONG AS HE COULD THAT LAST RACE CAUSED SOME TROUBLE A YOUNG SCAMP CALLED SLIPPERY SAM WON IT AND MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SWUM UP INSIDE HIS HOUSE
CHAPTER TWO GOING TO THE SOUTH MY COUNTRY SHALL THY HONOURED NAME BE AS A BYE WORD THROUGH THE WORLD ROUSE FOR AS IF TO BLAST THY FAME THIS KEEN REPROACH IS AT THEE HURLED
THE BANNER THAT ABOVE THE WAVES IS FLOATING O'ER THREE MILLION SLAVES DICK WALKER THE SLAVE SPECULATOR WHO HAD PURCHASED CURRER AND ALTHESA PUT THEM IN PRISON UNTIL HIS GANG WAS MADE UP
AND THEN REPORTED TO HIS MASTER THAT THE OLD BOYS WERE ALL RIGHT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY THE LIGHTS OF ANOTHER STEAMER WERE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE AND APPARENTLY COMING UP VERY FAST THIS WAS A SIGNAL FOR A GENERAL COMMOTION ON THE PATRIOT
AND EVERYTHING INDICATED THAT A STEAMBOAT RACE WAS AT HAND NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE EXCITEMENT ATTENDANT UPON A STEAMBOAT RACE ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY THE TIME THE BOATS HAD REACHED MEMPHIS THEY WERE SIDE BY SIDE
AND EACH EXERTING ITSELF TO KEEP THE ASCENDANCY IN POINT OF SPEED THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR THE MOON SHINING BRIGHTLY AND THE BOATS SO NEAR TO EACH OTHER THAT THE PASSENGERS WERE CALLING OUT FROM ONE BOAT TO THE OTHER
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS CHANGE HANDS DURING A PASSAGE FROM LOUISVILLE OR SAINT LOUIS TO NEW ORLEANS ON A MISSISSIPPI STEAMER AND MANY MEN AND EVEN LADIES ARE COMPLETELY RUINED GO CALL MY BOY STEWARD
SAID MISTER SMITH AS HE TOOK HIS CARDS ONE BY ONE FROM THE TABLE IN A FEW MOMENTS A FINE LOOKING BRIGHT EYED MULATTO BOY APPARENTLY ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS STANDING BY HIS MASTER'S SIDE AT THE TABLE
YOU WILL NOT FORGET THAT YOU BELONG TO ME SAID JOHNSON AS THE YOUNG SLAVE WAS STEPPING FROM THE TABLE TO A CHAIR NO SIR REPLIED THE CHATTEL
WHO DO YOU BELONG TO SAID A GENTLEMAN TO AN OLD BLACK MAN
HE GOES TO BED AT NIGHT THE PROPERTY OF THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAS LIVED FOR YEARS AND GETS UP IN THE MORNING THE SLAVE OF SOME ONE WHOM HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
AND ONE OF THE PARTY SEIZED HIS PISTOL AND FIRED BUT FORTUNATELY THE BARREL OF THE PISTOL WAS KNOCKED UP JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO BE DISCHARGED AND THE BALL PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER DECK INSTEAD OF THE MAN'S HEAD AS INTENDED ORDER WAS SOON RESTORED
THE MANTLED TREACHERY OF HIS SOUL O WHERE IS HE WHO HATH SURVEYED THE HORRORS OF OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE THERE IS AN EYE THAT WAKES IN LIGHT THERE IS A HAND OF PEERLESS MIGHT WHICH SOON OR LATE
AND CONTINUED TO IMPART HIS VIEWS HE SAID THE PEASANTS WERE OBDURATE AND THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT IT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT TO OVERRESIST THEM WITHOUT AN ARMED FORCE AND WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER FIRST TO SEND FOR THE MILITARY I'LL GIVE THEM ARMED FORCE
YOU BEGRUDGED YOUR LUMP OF A SON A LITTLE OLD MAN SUDDENLY BEGAN ATTACKING DRON
KARP THRUSTING HIS FINGERS INTO HIS BELT AND SMILING A LITTLE WALKED TO THE FRONT DRON ON THE CONTRARY RETIRED TO THE REAR AND THE CROWD DREW CLOSER TOGETHER
LOOK HERE PUT IT UNDER THE BAST MATTING AND COVER IT WITH HAY THAT'S THE WAY
UNWILLING TO OBTRUDE HIMSELF ON THE PRINCESS ROSTOV DID NOT GO BACK TO THE HOUSE BUT REMAINED IN THE VILLAGE AWAITING HER DEPARTURE WHEN HER CARRIAGE DROVE OUT OF THE HOUSE HE MOUNTED AND ACCOMPANIED HER EIGHT MILES FROM BOGUCHAROVO TO WHERE THE ROAD WAS OCCUPIED BY OUR TROOPS
AT THE INN AT YANKOVO HE RESPECTFULLY TOOK LEAVE OF HER FOR THE FIRST TIME PERMITTING HIMSELF TO KISS HER HAND HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO HE BLUSHINGLY REPLIED TO PRINCESS MARY'S EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE FOR HER DELIVERANCE AS SHE TERMED WHAT HAD OCCURRED
WITH THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF HIS SOUL BUT WHICH YET AROUSED INVOLUNTARY HORROR IN HIM WAS DRAWING NEAR SHALL I JOIN THE ARMY AND ENTER THE SERVICE
EVERYONE HAS LEFT MOSCOW AND THE PEOPLE ARE RIOTING HOW IS IT THAT WE ARE STAYING ON ON THE CONTRARY THINGS SEEM SATISFACTORY MA COUSINE SAID PIERRE IN THE BANTERING TONE HE HABITUALLY ADOPTED TOWARD HER ALWAYS FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE ROLE OF HER BENEFACTOR
SATISFACTORY INDEED VERY SATISFACTORY BARBARA IVANOVNA TOLD ME TODAY HOW OUR TROOPS ARE DISTINGUISHING THEMSELVES IT CERTAINLY DOES THEM CREDIT AND THE PEOPLE TOO ARE QUITE MUTINOUS
THEY NO LONGER OBEY EVEN MY MAID HAS TAKEN TO BEING RUDE AT THIS RATE THEY WILL SOON BEGIN BEATING US ONE CAN'T WALK IN THE STREETS BUT ABOVE ALL THE FRENCH WILL BE HERE ANY DAY NOW SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR I ASK JUST ONE THING OF YOU COUSIN SHE WENT ON
ARRANGE FOR ME TO BE TAKEN TO PETERSBURG WHATEVER I MAY BE I CAN'T LIVE UNDER BONAPARTE'S RULE OH COME MA COUSINE WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR INFORMATION FROM ON THE CONTRARY
AND HONOR AND GLORY TO WHOEVER CAPTURES HIM HE SAYS THIS IS WHAT HIS CAJOLERY HAS BROUGHT US TO BARBARA IVANOVNA TOLD ME THE MOB NEAR KILLED HER BECAUSE SHE SAID SOMETHING IN FRENCH OH BUT IT'S SO YOU
TAKE EVERYTHING SO TO HEART SAID PIERRE AND BEGAN LAYING OUT HIS CARDS FOR PATIENCE ALTHOUGH THAT PATIENCE DID COME OUT PIERRE DID NOT JOIN THE ARMY BUT REMAINED IN DESERTED MOSCOW EVER IN THE SAME STATE OF AGITATION
WHO WAS MOANING PITEOUSLY ANOTHER CRIMINAL THIN AND PALE STOOD NEAR JUDGING BY THEIR FACES THEY WERE BOTH FRENCHMEN WITH A FRIGHTENED AND SUFFERING LOOK RESEMBLING THAT ON THE THIN FRENCHMAN'S FACE PIERRE PUSHED HIS WAY IN THROUGH THE CROWD
THAT NO ONE ANSWERED HIM THE STOUT MAN ROSE FROWNED SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND EVIDENTLY TRYING TO APPEAR FIRM BEGAN TO PULL ON HIS JACKET WITHOUT LOOKING ABOUT HIM BUT SUDDENLY HIS LIPS TREMBLED AND HE BEGAN TO CRY
HE HAD TOLD THE COACHMAN THIS OR THAT THE MAN OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN IT FOR HIMSELF ON REACHING HOME PIERRE GAVE ORDERS TO EVSTAFEY HIS HEAD COACHMAN WHO KNEW EVERYTHING COULD DO ANYTHING AND WAS KNOWN TO ALL MOSCOW
AND THAT HIS SADDLE HORSES SHOULD BE SENT THERE THIS COULD NOT ALL BE ARRANGED THAT DAY SO ON
EVERY HOUSE IN MOZHAYSK HAD SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN IT AND AT THE HOSTEL WHERE PIERRE WAS MET BY HIS GROOM AND COACHMAN THERE WAS NO ROOM TO BE HAD IT WAS FULL OF OFFICERS
THAT BY ADVANCING THIRTEEN HUNDRED MILES AND GIVING BATTLE WITH A PROBABILITY OF LOSING A QUARTER OF HIS ARMY HE WAS ADVANCING TO CERTAIN DESTRUCTION AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN EQUALLY CLEAR TO KUTUZOV THAT BY ACCEPTING BATTLE
AT THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN FRONT OF THIS POSITION THEY SAY A FORTIFIED OUTPOST WAS SET UP ON THE SHEVARDINO MOUND TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY ON THE TWENTY FOURTH WE ARE TOLD NAPOLEON ATTACKED THIS ADVANCED POST AND TOOK IT
THAT IS THE POSITION ON WHICH THE BATTLE TOOK PLACE BUT NEVER TILL THE TWENTY FIFTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN TWELVE DID THEY THINK THAT A BATTLE MIGHT BE FOUGHT THERE THIS WAS SHOWN FIRST BY THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO ENTRENCHMENTS THERE BY THE TWENTY FIFTH
STRONGLY FORTIFIED THAN ANY OTHER POST AND WHY WERE ALL EFFORTS EXHAUSTED AND SIX THOUSAND MEN SACRIFICED TO DEFEND IT TILL LATE AT NIGHT ON THE TWENTY FOURTH A COSSACK PATROL WOULD HAVE SUFFICED TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY THIRDLY
THAT THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT WAS AN ADVANCED POST WHEREAS IN REALITY IT WAS SIMPLY A FORTIFIED POINT ON THE LEFT FLANK AND THAT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO WAS FOUGHT BY US ON AN ENTRENCHED POSITION PREVIOUSLY SELECTED WHERE
PROTECTED BY THE RIVER KOLOCHA PRESENTS ITSELF AS OBVIOUS FOR AN ARMY WHOSE OBJECT WAS TO PREVENT AN ENEMY FROM ADVANCING ALONG THE SMOLENSK ROAD TO MOSCOW NAPOLEON
ON THE TWENTY FOURTH DID NOT SEE AS THE HISTORY BOOKS SAY HE DID THE POSITION OF THE RUSSIANS FROM UTITSA TO BORODINO HE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN THAT POSITION BECAUSE IT DID NOT EXIST NOR DID HE SEE AN ADVANCED POST OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY
AT GRIDNEVA AND AS THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS DID NOT WISH OR WERE NOT IN TIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT THEN ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FOURTH THE FIRST AND CHIEF ACTION OF THE BATTLE OF BORODINO
MISTER COLLINS RECEIVED AND RETURNED THESE FELICITATIONS WITH EQUAL PLEASURE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO RELATE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR INTERVIEW WITH THE RESULT OF WHICH HE TRUSTED HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO BE EQUALLY SATISFIED THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD MEANT TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY PROTESTING AGAINST HIS PROPOSALS BUT SHE DARED NOT BELIEVE IT
IF THEREFORE SHE ACTUALLY PERSISTS IN REJECTING MY SUIT PERHAPS IT WERE BETTER NOT TO FORCE HER INTO ACCEPTING ME BECAUSE IF LIABLE TO SUCH DEFECTS OF TEMPER SHE COULD NOT CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO MY FELICITY
FROM THIS DAY YOU MUST BE A STRANGER TO ONE OF YOUR PARENTS YOUR MOTHER WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT MARRY MISTER COLLINS AND I WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO
MY DEAR REPLIED HER HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SMALL FAVOURS TO REQUEST FIRST THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE FREE USE OF MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND SECONDLY
WHILE THE FAMILY WERE IN THIS CONFUSION CHARLOTTE LUCAS CAME TO SPEND THE DAY WITH THEM SHE WAS MET IN THE VESTIBULE BY LYDIA WHO FLYING TO HER CRIED IN A HALF WHISPER
WHO CAME TO TELL THE SAME NEWS AND NO SOONER HAD THEY ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE MISSUS BENNET WAS ALONE THAN SHE LIKEWISE BEGAN ON THE SUBJECT CALLING ON MISS LUCAS FOR HER COMPASSION
WHO SUFFER AS I DO FROM NERVOUS COMPLAINTS CAN HAVE NO GREAT INCLINATION FOR TALKING
WOULD ONLY INCREASE THE IRRITATION SHE TALKED ON THEREFORE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FROM ANY OF THEM TILL THEY WERE JOINED BY MISTER COLLINS
BUT BY STIFFNESS OF MANNER AND RESENTFUL SILENCE HE SCARCELY EVER SPOKE TO HER AND THE ASSIDUOUS ATTENTIONS WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO SENSIBLE OF HIMSELF WERE TRANSFERRED FOR THE REST OF THE DAY TO MISS LUCAS
MISTER COLLINS WAS ALSO IN THE SAME STATE OF ANGRY PRIDE ELIZABETH HAD HOPED THAT HIS RESENTMENT MIGHT SHORTEN HIS VISIT BUT HIS PLAN DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST AFFECTED BY IT HE WAS ALWAYS TO HAVE GONE ON SATURDAY
AND ATTENDED THEM TO THEIR AUNT'S WHERE HIS REGRET AND VEXATION AND THE CONCERN OF EVERYBODY
TO ELIZABETH HOWEVER HE VOLUNTARILY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NECESSITY OF HIS ABSENCE HAD BEEN SELF IMPOSED I FOUND SAID HE AS THE TIME DREW NEAR
BUT ELIZABETH FELT AN ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT WHICH DREW OFF HER ATTENTION EVEN FROM WICKHAM AND NO SOONER HAD HE AND HIS COMPANION TAKEN LEAVE THAN A GLANCE FROM JANE INVITED HER TO FOLLOW HER UP STAIRS
HE WILL HAVE FREQUENT OPPORTUNITY NOW OF SEEING HER ON THE MOST INTIMATE FOOTING HER RELATIONS ALL WISH THE CONNECTION AS MUCH AS HIS OWN AND A SISTER'S PARTIALITY IS NOT MISLEADING ME I THINK
BUT THE CASE IS THIS WE ARE NOT RICH ENOUGH OR GRAND ENOUGH FOR THEM AND SHE IS THE MORE ANXIOUS TO GET MISS DARCY FOR HER BROTHER FROM THE NOTION THAT WHEN THERE HAS BEEN ONE INTERMARRIAGE SHE MAY HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN ACHIEVING A SECOND
IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
CAROLINE IS INCAPABLE OF WILFULLY DECEIVING ANYONE
IS THAT SHE IS DECEIVING HERSELF THAT IS RIGHT YOU COULD NOT HAVE STARTED A MORE HAPPY IDEA SINCE YOU WILL NOT TAKE COMFORT IN MINE BELIEVE HER TO BE DECEIVED BY ALL MEANS
THE IDEA OF HIS RETURNING NO MORE ELIZABETH TREATED WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT IT APPEARED TO HER MERELY THE SUGGESTION OF CAROLINE'S INTERESTED WISHES AND SHE COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT SUPPOSE THAT THOSE WISHES
AND HAD SOON THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ITS HAPPY EFFECT JANE'S TEMPER WAS NOT DESPONDING AND SHE WAS GRADUALLY LED TO HOPE THOUGH THE DIFFIDENCE OF AFFECTION SOMETIMES OVERCAME THE HOPE THAT BINGLEY WOULD RETURN TO NETHERFIELD
BUT HERE SHE DID INJUSTICE TO THE FIRE AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS CHARACTER FOR IT LED HIM TO ESCAPE OUT OF LONGBOURN HOUSE THE NEXT MORNING WITH ADMIRABLE SLYNESS AND HASTEN TO LUCAS LODGE TO THROW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
WHO ACCEPTED HIM SOLELY FROM THE PURE AND DISINTERESTED DESIRE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT CARED NOT HOW SOON THAT ESTABLISHMENT WERE GAINED SIR WILLIAM AND LADY LUCAS WERE SPEEDILY APPLIED TO FOR THEIR CONSENT
AND HIS PROSPECTS OF FUTURE WEALTH WERE EXCEEDINGLY FAIR LADY LUCAS BEGAN DIRECTLY TO CALCULATE WITH MORE INTEREST THAN THE MATTER HAD EVER EXCITED BEFORE HOW MANY YEARS LONGER MISTER BENNET WAS LIKELY TO LIVE
AND SIR WILLIAM GAVE IT AS HIS DECIDED OPINION THAT WHENEVER MISTER COLLINS SHOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF THE LONGBOURN ESTATE IT WOULD BE HIGHLY EXPEDIENT THAT BOTH HE AND HIS WIFE SHOULD MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE AT SAINT JAMES'S
FOR THE CURIOSITY EXCITED BY HIS LONG ABSENCE BURST FORTH IN SUCH VERY DIRECT QUESTIONS ON HIS RETURN AS REQUIRED SOME INGENUITY TO EVADE AND HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME EXERCISING GREAT SELF DENIAL
AS FOR MY FAIR COUSINS THOUGH MY ABSENCE MAY NOT BE LONG ENOUGH TO RENDER IT NECESSARY
RELATED THE EVENT OF THE DAY BEFORE THE POSSIBILITY OF MISTER COLLINS'S FANCYING HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER FRIEND HAD ONCE OCCURRED TO ELIZABETH WITHIN THE LAST DAY OR TWO BUT THAT CHARLOTTE COULD ENCOURAGE HIM
SHE SOON REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND CALMLY REPLIED WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED MY DEAR ELIZA
AS E G AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF A MOVEMENT BUT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE EAR A SINGLE ISOLATED MEASURE IS NOT POSSIBLE AND THE TERM MUST THEREFORE BE DEFINED IN THE PLURAL FORM
PERHAPS THE EASIEST WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY IS TO ADMIT THAT BOTH MAY BE TRUE
TENTS AND BEDDING SUFFICIENT TO LAST UNTIL SOME OF OUR NUMEROUS PLANS OF WORK AFTER OUR ARRIVAL BROUGHT IN RETURNS MY HOPE WAS TO MEET MY FATHER THERE FOR HE HAD WRITTEN THAT HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD GO TO THE NEW GOLD FIELDS
DURING MY TRIP OUT FROM ALASKA THE FALL BEFORE WHILE I WAS UPON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A DOZEN OR MORE OF THE PASSENGERS WITH WHOM I HAD TRAVELED FROM THE SAME PLACE OF PASSENGERS WE HAD ALL TOLD
FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN OF THESE THIRTY FIVE WERE WOMEN THERE WAS ONLY ONE CHILD ON BOARD AND THAT WAS THE LITTLE BLACK EYED GIRL WITH HER ESKIMO MOTHER AND WHITE FATHER FROM GOLOVIN BAY
A PACE WHICH MY ENGLISH FRIENDS AND OTHERS COULD NOT FOLLOW FOR THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLY ILL IN THE REGION OF THEIR DIGESTIVE APPARATUS FOR SEVERAL DAYS I SLEPT FOR HOURS EACH DAY AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE TRIP
AND OCCUPYING THE NEXT STATEROOM TO MINE THE LAST NAMED WERE GOING TO START A RESTAURANT IN NOME AS THEY WERE SOCIABLE JOLLY AND GOOD SAILORS FOR THE MOST PART I ENJOYED THEIR SOCIETY THEY HAD ALL LIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR YEARS
AND SHE SANG MANY TIMES ACCOMPANIED BY THE STRINGED INSTRUMENTS OF THE MUSICIANS MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE ASSEMBLED PASSENGERS WHEN SHE SANG ONE EVENING IN HER CLEAR SYMPATHETIC VOICE THE SELECTION
OH WHERE IS MY WANDERING BOY TONIGHT THERE WAS NOT A DRY EYE IN THE ROOM AND THE MIND OF MANY A MAN WENT BACK TO HIS OLD HOME AND PRAYING MOTHER IN SOME FAR DISTANT STATE
THOSE WHO WERE CONTINUALLY SEASICK HAD DIVERSION ENOUGH IT WAS USELESS FOR US TO TELL THEM A PATHETIC TALE OF SOME ONE WHO AT SOME TIME HAD BEEN MORE ILL THAN THEY BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT
AND HOPED THEY WOULD IF THAT WOULD PUT AN END TO THEIR SUFFERINGS WE TRIED AT LAST TO GIVE THEM COMFORT BY RECOMMENDING OUT OF FORMER EXPERIENCES SHIP'S BISCUIT DRY TOAST AND POP CORN AS REMEDIES
AND HERE NUMBERS OF SHIPS LAY ANCHORED AT REST PASSING ALONG EASILY BEYOND ANOTHER HIGH MOUNTAIN WE WERE SOON AT THE DOCK OF UNALASKA BESIDE OTHER GREAT SHIPS IN PORT
NO TREE NOR SHRUB OBSTRUCTED THE WAY WITH GNARLED OLD TRUNKS TWISTED ROOTS OR LOW HANGING BRANCHES FOR NONE GROW IN UNALASKA
AND THE BOLD DIGNITY AND GRANDEUR OF THE MOUNTAINS IS NEVER DIMINISHED BY THESE LESSER OBJECTS AS OUR SHIP SAILED OUT INTO BEHRING SEA WE WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY THE STEAMER GEORGE W ELDER WHOSE MASTER
THEN CAME HARD RAIN AND WIND THAT FOR SEVERAL DAYS BLEW THE ICE BACK INTO THE BAY FIRST TO ONE SIDE AND THEN TO THE OTHER SO THAT THE STEAMERS WAITING TO COME IN COULD NOT DO SO FOR FEAR OF THE DRIFTING FLOES
THEY CAME FROM THE EAST WEST NORTH AND SOUTH ALL SORRY TO KNOW OF HER ILLNESS AND BRINGING PRESENTS WITH THEM SOMETIMES IT WAS A LITTLE LIVE BIRD OR SQUIRREL A DELICIOUS SALMON TROUT
NOTHING SO DELICIOUS AS THEIR SALADS FOR THE FRENCH COOKS HAD LONG AGO GONE THE HOTEL MANAGEMENT BEING CHANGED AND MOLLIE HAD A NICE LITTLE KITCHEN OF HER OWN AND WITH FRESH SALMON TROUT WILD FOWL
THEN HER BIG BLACK EYES GLANCE BRIGHTLY INTO BLUE ONES LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE FULL RED LIPS PART IN A CORDIAL SMILE WHILE THE ONE SOLITARY DIMPLE IN THE SMOOTH ROUND CHEEK
FAREWELL TO MY WHITE FACED FRIENDS AND TO THE DARK SKINNED ONES
OF A FALL OF TADPOLES FROM THE SKY AS TO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
THE WRITER SAYS THAT ALL OBSERVERS WERE MISTAKEN THAT THE FROGS OR TOADS MUST HAVE FALLEN FROM TREES OR OTHER PLACES OVERHEAD TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF LITTLE TOADS ONE OR TWO MONTHS OLD
JULY THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT
THAT I HAVE NOTES UPON TWO OTHER FALLS OF TINY TOADS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE ONE IN FRANCE AND ONE IN TAHITI ALSO OF FISH IN SCOTLAND BUT IN THE PHENOMENON OF THE APENNINES THE MIXTURE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF THE PRODUCTS OF A WHIRLWIND
BUT HERE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SCOOP IN THE EXCLUSIONIST IMAGINATION THERE IS NO REGARD FOR MUD DEBRIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF A POND FLOATING VEGETATION LOOSE THINGS FROM THE SHORES BUT A PRECISE PICKING OUT OF FROGS ONLY
WHIRLWINDS WE READ OF OVER AND OVER BUT WHERE AND WHAT WHIRLWIND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANYBODY WHO HAD LOST A POND WOULD BE HEARD FROM IN SYMONS METEOROLOGICAL MAGAZINE
OTHER THAN THAT HOSTS OF DATA HAVE BEEN LOST BECAUSE ORTHODOXY DOES NOT LOOK FAVORABLY UPON SUCH REPORTS THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW RECORDS SEVERAL FALLS OF FISHES IN THE UNITED STATES
OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM BRISTLING WITH EXCLUSIONISM WRITES THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM ALIVE WERE VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HE SAYS ON READING THE EVIDENCE IT SEEMS TO ME MOST PROBABLY ONLY A PRACTICAL JOKE
THE EDITOR SAYS THAT ONE WAS A MINNOW AND THAT THE REST WERE STICKLEBACKS HE SAYS THAT DOCTOR GRAY'S EXPLANATION IS NO DOUBT RIGHT BUT
OR CONSIDERABLY OUT OF RANGE OF THE PLAYFUL PAIL OF WATER ACCORDING TO THE ANNUAL REGISTER
THE FISHES THEMSELVES HAD FALLEN BY PAILFULS IF THESE FISHES WERE NOT UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE WE BASE OUR OBJECTIONS TO THE WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION UPON TWO DATA THAT THEY FELL IN NO SUCH DISTRIBUTION AS ONE COULD ATTRIBUTE TO THE DISCHARGE OF A WHIRLWIND
SOME WERE PLACED IN FRESH WATER THESE SEEMED TO THRIVE WELL AS TO NARROW DISTRIBUTION WE ARE TOLD THAT THE FISHES FELL IN AND ABOUT THE PREMISES OF MISTER NIXON IT WAS NOT OBSERVED AT THE TIME THAT ANY FISH FELL IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
SAVE IN THE PARTICULAR SPOT MENTIONED IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH TENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE VICAR GRIFFITH WRITES AN ACCOUNT THE ROOFS OF SOME HOUSES WERE COVERED WITH THEM
FIFESHIRE SCOTLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR
MORADABAD INDIA JULY TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE
SOME OF THE FISH WERE FRESH BUT OTHERS WERE ROTTEN AND WITHOUT HEADS AMONG THE NUMBER WHICH I GOT FIVE WERE FRESH AND THE REST STINKING AND HEADLESS THEY REMIND US OF HIS GRACE'S OBSERVATION OF SOME PAGES BACK
AGAIN THE SMALL AREA ABOUT SIXTY BY THIRTY YARDS THE FALL OCCURRED DURING A HEAVY RAIN THAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER
THE FISH WERE ALL DEAD AND INDEED STIFF AND HARD WHEN PICKED UP IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OCCURRENCE BY ALL OF WHICH I MEAN THAT WE HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO PILE UP OUR DATA OF THINGS THAT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE OVERHEAD
FELL A SMALL PIECE OF ALABASTER THAT AT BOVINA EIGHT MILES FROM VICKSBURG FELL A GOPHER TURTLE THEY FELL IN A HAILSTORM THIS ITEM WAS WIDELY COPIED AT THE TIME FOR INSTANCE NATURE
LONG DURATION OTHER INDICATIONS OF LONG DURATION I THINK OF A REGION SOMEWHERE ABOVE THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN WHICH GRAVITATION IS INOPERATIVE AND IS NOT GOVERNED BY THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE
THAT ACCORDING TO DAS WETTER DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO UPON AUGUST NINTH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO A YELLOW CLOUD APPEARED OVER PADERBORN GERMANY FROM THIS CLOUD FELL A TORRENTIAL RAIN IN WHICH WERE HUNDREDS OF MUSSELS
BUT NONE WERE FOUND ON ROOFS OR ANY OTHER ELEVATION ABOVE GROUND AND NONE WERE SEEN TO FALL IF YOU PREFER TO BELIEVE THAT THE SNAKES HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE OR HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THAT SOMETHING OCCURRED TO CALL SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEM
AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE STREETS CRAWLING LOOSE OR IN THICK TANGLED MASSES IN THE FIRST PLACE IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT THESE SNAKES HAD BEEN RAISED FROM SOME OTHER PART OF THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN A WHIRLWIND IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT A WHIRLWIND COULD SEGREGATE THEM
STONES FENCE RAILS LIMBS OF TREES SAY THAT THE SNAKES OCCUPIED THE NEXT GRADATION AND WOULD BE THE NEXT TO FALL
AGAIN OURS IS THE OBJECTION AGAINST SUCH SELECTIVENESS BY A WHIRLWIND CONCEIVABLY A WHIRLWIND COULD SCOOP OUT A DEN OF HIBERNATING SNAKES WITH STONES AND EARTH AND AN INFINITUDE OF OTHER DEBRIS SNATCHING UP DOZENS OF SNAKES
BUT I WANTED YOU TO FORM GOOD MENTAL HABITS JUST AS I WANT YOU TO HAVE CLEAN STRAIGHT PHYSICAL ONES BECAUSE I WAS RUN THROUGH A THRESHING MACHINE WHEN I WAS A BOY AND DIDN'T BEGIN TO GET THE STRAW OUT OF MY HAIR TILL I WAS PAST THIRTY
AND CHICAGO WASN'T COOK COUNTY THEN EITHER YOU CAN GET THEM STILL BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO KANKAKEE AND TAKE A HAMMERLESS ALONG AND WHEN I STARTED IN THE PACKING BUSINESS IT WAS ALL STRAIGHT SAILING NO FRILLS JUST TURNING HOGS INTO HOG MEAT
IT TAKES DOCTORS LAWYERS ENGINEERS POETS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO RUN THE BUSINESS AND I RECKON THAT IMPROVEMENTS WHICH CALL FOR PARSONS WILL BE CREEPING IN NEXT NATURALLY A YOUNG MAN WHO EXPECTS TO HOLD HIS OWN WHEN HE IS THROWN IN WITH A LOT OF MEN LIKE THESE
BUT OLD DURHAM FOUND OUT WHAT EVERY ONE LEARNS WHO GETS HIS AMBITIONS MIXED UP WITH NUMBER TWO RED THAT THERE'S A HEAP OF IT LYING AROUND LOOSE IN THE COUNTRY THE BEARS DID QUICK WORK AND KEPT THE CASH WHEAT COMING IN SO LIVELY THAT ONE SETTLING DAY
JIM KEPT AT THIS FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS UNTIL HIS FEET BEGAN TO HURT HIM I GUESS AND THEN HE WAS OUT OF A JOB AGAIN IT SEEMS HE HAD HEARD SOMETHING OF A NEW MACHINE FOR REGISTERING THE MEN THAT DID AWAY WITH MOST OF THE TIMEKEEPERS EXCEPT THE FELLOWS WHO WATCHED THE MACHINES
JIM MADE TWO TRIPS WITHOUT SELLING ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM WORKING OVERTIME AT THE FACTORY AND THEN HE CAME INTO MY OFFICE WITH A LONG STORY ABOUT HOW WE WERE DOING IT ALL WRONG SAID WE OUGHT TO GO FOR THE CONSUMER BY ADVERTISING
I REMEMBER ONE PICTURE HE GOT OUT SHOWING SIXTEEN COWS STANDING BETWEEN SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A LETTER PRESS AND TELLING HOW EVERY POUND OR SO OF GRAHAM'S EXTRACT CONTAINED THE JUICE SQUEEZED FROM A HERD OF STEERS IF AN EXPLORER STARTED FOR THE NORTH POLE
I NEVER SELL GOODS WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE I CAN FIND THEM WHEN I WANT THEM AND IF THESE FELLOWS TRY TO PUT THEIR FOREFEET IN THE TROUGH OR START ANY SHOVING AND CROWDING THEY'RE GOING TO FIND ME FORGETTING MY TABLE MANNERS TOO
FOR WHEN IT COMES TO FUNNY BUSINESS I'M SOMETHING OF A HUMORIST MYSELF AND WHILE I'M TOO OLD TO RUN I'M YOUNG ENOUGH TO STAND AND FIGHT FIRST AND LAST A GOOD MANY MEN HAVE GONE GUNNING FOR ME BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS PLANNED THE OBSEQUIES BEFORE THEY CAUGHT THE DECEASED
GRAHAM'S EXTRACT IT MAKES THE WEAK STRONG
WENT ALL AROUND TOWN SAYING THAT I HAD GIVEN A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR SHED TO CHARITY AND PAINTED A THOUSAND DOLLAR AD ON IT ALLOWED I OUGHT TO SEND MY CHECK FOR THAT AMOUNT TO THE CRECHE FUND KEPT AT IT TILL I BEGAN TO THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN IT AFTER ALL AND SENT HER THE MONEY
YOU GO HOME WORRYING BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID THAT YOUR FOOL NEW CLERK FORGOT TO LOCK THE SAFE AFTER YOU AND DURING THE NIGHT THE LARD REFINERY BURNS DOWN YOU SPEND A YEAR FRETTING BECAUSE YOU THINK BILL JONES IS GOING TO CUT YOU OUT WITH YOUR BEST GIRL AND THEN YOU SPEND TEN WORRYING BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
A BUSY MAN HAS NO TIME TO BOTHER WITH IT HE CAN ALWAYS FIND PLENTY OF OLD WOMEN IN SKIRTS OR TROUSERS TO SPEND THEIR DAYS WORRYING OVER THEIR OWN TROUBLES AND TO SIT UP NIGHTS WAKING HIS SPEAKING OF HANDING OVER YOUR WORRIES TO OTHERS NATURALLY CALLS TO MIND THE WIDOW WILLIAMS AND HER SON BUD
AND SOMEWAYS THE WHOLE DROVE ALWAYS SHOWED UP SAFE AND DIRTY ABOUT MEAL TIME
AND THE OLD MAN RESPONDED PROMPTLY WHERE'S BUD ASKED THE WIDOW
FOR RIGHT THERE THE OLD LADY GOT UP WITH A MIGHTY SET EXPRESSION AROUND HER LIPS AND MARCHED OUT MUTTERING THAT IT WAS JUST AS SHE HAD THOUGHT ALL ALONG BUD WASN'T THERE AND WHEN THE NEIGHBORS DROPPED IN THAT AFTERNOON TO PLAN OUT A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HER LOST LAMB
BUT IT APPEARED THAT HE LEFT HOME TO GET A FEW INDIAN SCALPS AND THAT HE CAME BACK FOR A LITTLE BACON AND CORN PONE I SIMPLY MENTION THE WIDOW IN PASSING AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT THE TIME TO DO YOUR WORRYING IS WHEN A THING IS ALL OVER AND THAT THE WAY TO DO IT IS TO LEAVE IT TO THE NEIGHBORS
MANTELISH EXCUSED HIMSELF AND WENT OFF WITH THE MESSENGER THE DOOR CLOSED QUILLAN CAME BACK TO HIS CHAIR WE'RE MOVING THE OUTFIT LATER TONIGHT THE COMMISSIONER EXPLAINED
QUILLAN DOES HAVE A DEGREE IN SUBSPACE ENGINEERING AND GETS ASSIGNED TO THE ENGINEERS NOW AND THEN BUT HIS REAL JOB'S SPACE SCOUT INTELLIGENCE TRIGGER NODDED I'D ALMOST GUESSED IT SHE GAVE QUILLAN ANOTHER SMILE
SOMEBODY WOULD GET THAT WORKED OUT PRETTY SOON WOULDN'T THEY
THEIR TREATIES OF LIMITATION WOULDN'T HAVE LET THEM GET INTO THE PLASMOID PIE UNTIL THE OTHERS HAD BEEN AT IT A DECADE OR SO THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EAGER THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE THEN TRIGGER SAID LORDY
AND WE KNOW DEFINITELY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE GAMBLING FOR IT HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING A COUPLE OF LEADS HERE PRETTY SHORT LEADS SO FAR BUT YOU WORK WITH WHAT YOU CAN GET HE NODDED AT THE TABLE
AND LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS FIDGETED AROUND HOPING TO GET THE KIND OF REPORT FROM MANTELISH AND FAYLE THAT MANTELISH THOUGHT THEY'D ALREADY RECEIVED THEY WERE WONDERING WHERE FAYLE WAS TOO BUT THEY KNEW FAYLE WAS SECURITY SO THEY DIDN'T LIKE TO GET TOO NOSY
HE WAS VISITING ANOTHER LAB WHERE THEY HAD A COUPLE OF PLASMOIDS WHICH ACTUALLY MOVED NOW AND THEN
THE TWO LAB PLASMOIDS STOPPED MOVING WHILE HE WAS THERE THEY HAVEN'T MOVED SINCE
MANTELISH TALKS OF SOMETHING HE CALLS PROXIMITY INFLUENCE
SO TRIGGER SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE TWO THIRDS OF WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE THIRD RIGHT HERE ON THE TABLE HOW MANY OF THE LATER RAIDERS DID YOU CATCH ALL OF THEM SAID THE COMMISSIONER AROUND FORTY
FORTY ONE WOMEN PICKETED IN PROTEST AGAINST THIS WANTON PERSECUTION OF THEIR LEADER AS WELL AS AGAINST THE DELAY IN PASSING THE AMENDMENT FACE TO FACE WITH AN EMBARRASSING NUMBER OF PRISONERS THE ADMINISTRATION USED ITS WITS AND DECIDED

MISSUS COSU WOULD NOT LET ME LIE ON THE FLOOR SHE PUT ME ON THE COUCH AND STRETCHED OUT ON THE FLOOR ON ONE OF THE TWO PADS THEY THREW IN
WHEN MISSUS LEWIS DOUBLED OVER AND HANDLED LIKE A SACK OF SOMETHING

ASKED FOR WHITTAKER WHO CAME HE SEIZED JULIA EMORY BY THE BACK OF HER NECK AND THREW HER INTO THE ROOM VERY BRUTALLY SHE IS A LITTLE GIRL I ASKED FOR COUNSEL TO LEARN THE STATUS OF THE CASE I WAS TOLD TO SHUT UP AND WAS AGAIN THREATENED WITH A STRAITJACKET AND A BUCKLE GAG

MY SISTER HUNGER STRUCK IN RUSSIA WHERE SHE WAS IMPRISONED FOR REFUSING TO REVEAL THE WHEREABOUTS OF TWO OF HER FRIENDS INDICTED FOR A GOVERNMENT OFFENSE SHE WAS FED AFTER THREE DAYS
MISSUS JOHN WINTERS BRANNAN WAS AMONG THE WOMEN WHO ENDURED THE NIGHT OF TERROR MISSUS BRANNAN IS THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLES A DANA FOUNDER OF THE NEW YORK SUN AND THAT GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT OF LIBERTY WHO WAS A TRUSTED ASSOCIATE AND COUNSELOR
SHE WROTE A COMPREHENSIVE AFFIDAVIT OF HER EXPERIENCE AFTER NARRATING THE EVENTS WHICH LED UP TO THE ATTACK SHE CONTINUES SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER THEN SHOUTED OUT IN A LOUD TONE OF VOICE
BY THE ARMS TWIST OR FORCE THEM BACK OF HER
I GAVE UP ALL IDEA OF GIVING MY NAME AT THE DESK AND INSTINCTIVELY JOINED MY COMPANIONS TO GO WITH THEM AND SHARE WHATEVER WAS IN STORE FOR THEM THE WHOLE GROUP OF WOMEN WERE THROWN DRAGGED OR HERDED OUT OF THE OFFICE ON TO THE PORCH DOWN THE STEPS TO THE GROUND AND FORCED TO CROSS THE ROAD
SEVEN OF US BEING IN THE PARTY WE WERE SO EXHAUSTED AND WEARY THAT WE WERE OBLIGED TO STOP CONSTANTLY TO REST ON OUR WAY BACK FROM THE WALK WE HEARD THE BAYING OF HOUNDS VERY NEAR US IN THE WOODS THE MATRON SAID
ONE OF THE PARTY MISS FINDEISEN ASKED WHETHER THEY WOULD ATTACK US TO WHICH THE MATRON REPLIED THAT IS JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND HURRIED US ALONG THE BAYING GREW LOUDER AND NEARER AT TIMES AND THEN MORE DISTANT AS THE DOGS RUSHED BACK AND FORTH
IF YOU WILL ONLY DROP THESE PROCEEDINGS I CAN ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE YOU THAT THE PRISONERS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE WORKHOUSE TO THE JAIL IN A WEEK IN A WEEK THEY MAY BE DEAD BY THAT TIME WE ANSWERED WE CANNOT WAIT
SHOULD BE EXECUTED IN THE DISTRICT HUNDREDS OF PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND WHO HAD SERVED THEIR SENTENCES IN VIRGINIA HAD BEEN WITHOUT MONEY OR INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO CONTEST THIS DOUBTFUL PROCEDURE IN THE COURTS THE ADMINISTRATION
WAS ALARMED WE QUICKENED OUR PACE A MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION RUSHED HIS ATTORNEY AS COURIER TO THE WOMEN IN THE WORKHOUSE TO IMPLORE THEM NOT TO CONSENT TO THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS HE WAS EASILY ADMITTED AND TRIED TO EXTORT FROM ONE PRISONER AT A TIME A PROMISE TO REJECT THE PLAN
WHERE HE KEPT HIMSELF DISCREETLY HIDDEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS WHEN A DEPUTY WAS FOUND SIX ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO SERVE THE WRIT ALL FAILED FINALLY BY A RUSE MISTER WHITTAKER WAS CAUGHT AT HIS HOME LATE AT NIGHT
I WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT FRIENDS NAY EVEN SO MUCH AS WITHOUT ACQUAINTANCE
BUT I MUST DO MYSELF JUSTICE AS TO PROTEST I KNEW NOTHING AMISS I MEANT NOTHING BUT IN AN HONEST WAY NOR HAD I ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT ME AT FIRST THAT LOOKED THE WAY WHICH AFTERWARDS I SUFFERED THEM TO BE GUIDED
I CONTRACTED AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH A WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED WHO THOUGH SHE DID NOT KEEP AN ILL HOUSE AS WE CALL IT YET HAD NONE OF THE BEST PRINCIPLES IN HERSELF I HAD ON ALL OCCASIONS BEHAVED MYSELF SO WELL
HERE I SAY I PASSED THE WINTER AS HEAVILY AS I HAD PASSED THE AUTUMN CHEERFULLY
OF WHAT LAY HARDEST UPON MY MIND AND PARTICULARLY THE NARROWNESS OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE LOSS OF MY FORTUNE BY THE DAMAGE OF MY GOODS AT SEA I TOLD HER ALSO THAT I HAD A MOTHER AND A BROTHER IN VIRGINIA IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES
AND INDEED WAS SO VERY KIND AS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF MY LIVING WITH HER TO SO LOW A PRICE DURING THE WINTER THAT SHE CONVINCED ME SHE GOT NOTHING BY ME AND AS FOR LODGING DURING THE WINTER I PAID NOTHING AT ALL
THE WINTER BEFORE AND HE CAME DOWN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN HIS COMPANY AND TWO SERVANTS AND LODGED IN THE SAME HOUSE
IF I MIGHT BELIEVE HIM WAS TO HIM
AND HE HAD SUCH AN OPINION OF MY VIRTUE THAT AS HE OFTEN PROFESSED HE BELIEVED IF HE SHOULD OFFER ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD REJECT HIM WITH CONTEMPT HE SOON UNDERSTOOD FROM ME THAT I WAS A WIDOW THAT I HAD ARRIVED AT BRISTOL FROM VIRGINIA BY THE LAST SHIPS
AND THAT I WAITED AT BATH TILL THE NEXT VIRGINIA FLEET SHOULD ARRIVE BY WHICH I EXPECTED CONSIDERABLE EFFECTS I UNDERSTOOD BY HIM AND BY OTHERS OF HIM THAT HE HAD A WIFE BUT THAT THE LADY WAS DISTEMPERED IN HER HEAD AND WAS UNDER THE CONDUCT
AND I ALSO INTO HIS WHEN HE WAS IN BED YET HE NEVER OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME FURTHER THAN A KISS OR SO MUCH AS SOLICITED ME TO ANYTHING TILL LONG AFTER AS YOU SHALL HEAR
I TOLD HER I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM THE LEAST OCCASION TO THINK I WANTED IT
BUT THE MAN YOU SENT TO BRISTOL YESTERDAY FOR MONEY IS COME BACK AND SAYS HE HAS BROUGHT NONE NOW I COULD BY NO MEANS LIKE HER PROJECT
NOT BY A GREAT DEAL WELL THEN HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE ME PROMISE TO GO AND FETCH HIM ALL THE MONEY I HAD EVERY FARTHING I TOLD HIM I WOULD AND I WENT INTO MY CHAMBER AND FETCHED HIM A LITTLE PRIVATE DRAWER
WHICH I DID VERY WILLINGLY BELIEVING AS IT APPEARED THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY IT NOR DID THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE FAIL TO FIND HER ACCOUNT IN IT TOO WE HAD LIVED THUS NEAR THREE MONTHS WHEN
THE COMPANY BEGINNING TO WEAR AWAY AT THE BATH HE TALKED OF GOING AWAY
HE HAD LEFT ALL HIS MONEY AND OTHER THINGS OF VALUE WITH ME AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM I DID NOT KNOW BUT I SECURED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD AND LOCKED UP THE LODGINGS AND WENT TO HIM WHERE I FOUND HIM VERY ILL INDEED HOWEVER I PERSUADED HIM TO BE CARRIED
BUT ALL ALONG ATTESTED IT TO BE WITH THE UTMOST RESERVE FOR MY VIRTUE AND HIS OWN I TOLD HIM I WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF IT HE CARRIED IT THAT LENGTH THAT HE PROTESTED TO ME THAT IF HE WAS NAKED IN BED WITH ME
AND COMING INTO THAT ROOM SAID VERY FRANKLY TO HIM SIR IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE LADY BE YOUR SPOUSE OR NO
WHICH DREW QUITE ACROSS THE ROOM AND EFFECTUALLY DIVIDED THE BEDS WELL SAYS MY FRIEND VERY READILY THESE BEDS WILL DO AND AS FOR THE REST WE ARE TOO NEAR AKIN TO LIE TOGETHER THOUGH WE MAY LODGE NEAR ONE ANOTHER
THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A MOST REMARKABLE SEA ROBBER HE WAS OFFERED THE COMMAND OF A SHIP WITH A WELL ARMED CREW OF MARINE SAVAGES
ON HIS RETURN TO JAMAICA AFTER ONE OF HIS EXPEDITIONS IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GIVE HIMSELF SOME RELAXATION AFTER THE HARDSHIPS AND DANGERS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO ROC TO GET HIMSELF THOROUGHLY DRUNK
BUT HE CHOSE TO GO HIMSELF AND HE CAME TO GRIEF NO SOONER DID THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIPS LYING IN THE HARBOR BEHOLD A BOAT APPROACHING WITH A BIG BROWED BROAD JAWED MARINER SITTING IN THE STERN
DURING THE TIME THAT PREPARATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR MAKING EXAMPLES OF THESE IMPERTINENT PIRATES
AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON THEIR WITS IF THEY HAD ANY ROC HAD PLENTY OF WIT AND HE USED IT WELL THERE WAS A SLAVE PROBABLY NOT A NEGRO NOR A NATIVE
THE LETTER WAS GIVEN TO HIM WITH VERY PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS AS TO WHAT HE WAS TO DO WITH IT HE WAS TO DISGUISE HIMSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND THEN IN THE NIGHT HE WAS TO MAKE HIS WAY OUT OF THE TOWN
AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS TO RETURN AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING ALONG THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR WHEN HE WAS TO STATE THAT HE HAD BEEN PUT ON SHORE FROM THE FRENCH VESSEL IN THE OFFING WITH A LETTER WHICH HE WAS TO PRESENT TO THE GOVERNOR THE SLAVE PERFORMED HIS PART OF THE BUSINESS VERY WELL
IF IT SHOULD BECOME KNOWN THAT THE GREAT PIRATE ROC HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH IN CAMPEACHY IT WAS AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A PRISONER TO HAVE SUCH POWERFUL FRIENDS SO NEAR BY AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK ROC'S CASE INTO MOST EARNEST CONSIDERATION
AND HE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE FELT HIMSELF IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO HAS STOLEN A BABY BEAR AND WHO HEARS THE ROAR OF AN APPROACHING PARENT THROUGH THE WOODS
THEY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RETIRE FROM THE BUCCANEERING BUSINESS AND THAT NOTHING WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN TO RETURN TO THE WAYS OF CIVILIZATION AND VIRTUE THERE WAS A SHIP ABOUT TO DEPART FOR SPAIN AND ON THIS THE GOVERNOR GAVE ROC AND HIS MEN FREE PASSAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN
IN EVERY WAY ROC BEHAVED SO WELL THAT FOR HIS SAKE ALL HIS MEN WERE TREATED KINDLY AND ALLOWED MANY PRIVILEGES BUT WHEN THIS PARTY OF REFORMED PIRATES REACHED SPAIN AND WERE ALLOWED TO GO WHERE THEY PLEASED
FROM THE ACTIVE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION
BY IGNOMINIOUSLY RUNNING AWAY THE LOYAL CHRONICLER HAD AS FIRM A BELIEF IN THE ABSOLUTE INABILITY OF HIS HERO TO FLY FROM DANGER AS WAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTTISH DOUGLAS WHEN HE STOOD
COME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASS
UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED HIMSELF TO HAVE ALL THOSE BRAVE AND SAVAGE QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING ESTEEMED AND REVERED AND UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED THOSE OTHER QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING DESPISED
FROM THIS FEELING OR THOUGHT NOTHING COULD HAVE TURNED ME NEITHER GENERAL DESPAIR NOR PERSONAL FEAR FOR I BELIEVED
MY VISION DOUBTLESS OWES THE GROVE AND ITS SOUTHERN COLOR EFFECT TO THE HUGE MASS OF FLOWERS HERE BESIDE ME
ALL THE REST IS READILY EXPLAINED BY PSYCHOLOGY
FRANKLY CLAIMING AND ASSERTING THE RIGHT TO A CHARMING CONFUSION THIS IS ALL THE MORE NECESSARY INASMUCH AS THE MATERIAL WHICH OUR LIFE AND LOVE OFFERS TO MY SPIRIT AND TO MY PEN IS SO INCESSANTLY PROGRESSIVE
SO I USE MY INCONTESTABLE RIGHT TO A CONFUSED STYLE BY INSERTING HERE IN THE WRONG PLACE ONE OF THE MANY INCOHERENT SHEETS WHICH I ONCE FILLED WITH RUBBISH
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING EVEN THE GRIEFS AND ALL MY THOUGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN AND ARE TO BE
OH I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL A FAIRY TALE THAT THERE COULD BE SUCH JOY SUCH LOVE AS I NOW FEEL AND SUCH A WOMAN WHO COULD BE MY MOST TENDER BELOVED MY BEST COMPANION AND AT THE SAME TIME
AND WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER YOU ACCOMPANY ME THROUGH ALL THE STAGES OF MANHOOD FROM THE UTMOST WANTONNESS TO THE MOST REFINED SPIRITUALITY IN YOU ALONE I FIRST SAW TRUE PRIDE
WOULD SEEM TO ME NOTHING BUT A CHARMING ANTITHESIS TO THE SUBLIME FRIVOLITY OF OUR MARRIAGE WHY SHOULD WE NOT TAKE THE HARSHEST WHIM OF CHANCE FOR AN EXCELLENT JEST AND A MOST FROLICSOME CAPRICE SINCE WE
AND EVEN ILLUMINATES THE DARKNESS OF THE FUTURE WITH ITS BRIGHT LUSTRE AS IT IS IN A SMALL WAY
THE POIGNANT GRIEF WOULD BE TRANSIENT AND QUICKLY RESOLVE ITSELF INTO COMPLETE HARMONY HOW COULD SEPARATION SEPARATE US WHEN PRESENCE ITSELF IS TO US AS IT WERE TOO PRESENT
IT IS NOT MERELY THE DELIGHT OF EXHAUSTION OR THE ANTICIPATION OF REVENGE I SEE IN IT A WONDERFUL AND PROFOUNDLY SIGNIFICANT ALLEGORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN AND WOMAN
I DID NOT THINK OF IT AS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE OR EVEN IN THE PRESENT EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY PAST FOR A LONG TIME YOU HAD BEEN WRAPT IN THE BOSOM OF THE COLD EARTH
NOW AND THEN THE PALE FACE SMILED AND SEEMED ASLEEP JUST AS IT HAD LOOKED THE LAST TIME I SAW IT THEN OF A SUDDEN THE DIFFERENT MEMORIES ALL BECAME CONFUSED
WITH UNBELIEVABLE RAPIDITY THE OUTLINES CHANGED REASSUMED THEIR FIRST FORM AND TRANSFORMED THEMSELVES AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL THE WILD VISION VANISHED
I WAS ALREADY HASTENING TO YOU WHEN SUDDENLY A NEW THOUGHT HELD ME BACK AND I SAID TO MY SPIRIT
AND FOR THAT REASON I SUSPECT IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN I HAVE ALREADY IMPARTED MY SUSPICION TO YOU THAT THE NEXT LIFE WILL BE LARGER AND IN THE GOOD AS WELL AS IN THE BAD STRONGER WILDER BOLDER AND MORE TREMENDOUS
SO DID I REGARD MY SUFFERING WITH MYSTERIOUS PLEASURE I REGARDED IT AS THE SYMBOL OF LIFE IN GENERAL I BELIEVED THAT I WAS SEEING AND FEELING THE EVERLASTING DISCORD
AND THE LOVELY FORMS OF REFINED CULTURE SEEMED DEAD AND TRIVIAL TO ME IN COMPARISON WITH THIS MONSTROUS WORLD OF INFINITE STRENGTH AND OF UNENDING STRUGGLE AND WARFARE
THIS FEELING ALSO CLUNG TO ME AND COMPLETELY SEPARATED ME FROM OTHER MEN JUST AS I WAS SUNDERED FROM THE EARTH BY THE THOUGHT THAT YOUR NATURE AND MY LOVE HAD BEEN TOO SACRED
FINALLY I BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS NOW NEARLY OVER THE BROW WAS NO LONGER SMOOTH AND THE LOCKS WERE BECOMING GRAY MY CAREER WAS ENDED BUT NOT COMPLETED
AND EVERY KNIGHT SHALL HAVE A SQUIRE AND TWO YEOMAN AND ALL WELL HORSED FOR THUS IT CHANCED ONE MORN WHEN ALL THE COURT GREEN SUITED BUT WITH PLUMES THAT MOCK'D THE MAY HAD BEEN THEIR WONT A MAYING
SO THEY MADE THEM READY AND THESE WERE THE NAMES OF THE KNIGHTS SIR KAY THE SENESCHAL SIR AGRIVAINE SIR BRANDILES SIR SAGRAMOUR LE DESIRUS
BE IT AS IT MAY SAID SIR MALEAGANS KNOW YOU WELL MADAM I HAVE LOVED YOU MANY A YEAR AND NEVER TILL NOW COULD I GET YOU TO SUCH ADVANTAGE AS I DO NOW AND THEREFORE I WILL TAKE YOU AS I FIND YOU
SLAY NOT MY NOBLE KNIGHTS AND I WILL GO WITH YOU UPON THIS COVENANT THAT
CARTS WERE LITTLE USED EXCEPT FOR CARRYING OFFAL AND FOR CONVEYING CRIMINALS TO EXECUTION BUT SIR LAUNCELOT TOOK NO THOUGHT OF ANYTHING BUT THE NECESSITY OF HASTE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESCUING THE QUEEN SO HE DEMANDED OF THE CARTER
AT LENGTH HIS PROGRESS WAS CHECKED BY A WIDE AND RAPID TORRENT WHICH COULD ONLY BE PASSED ON A NARROW BRIDGE ON WHICH A FALSE STEP WOULD PROVE HIS DESTRUCTION LAUNCELOT LEADING HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND MAKING HIM SWIM BY HIS SIDE
FOR HER LOVER SUDDENLY STARTED FROM HER AND BITTERLY LAMENTING THAT HE HAD INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF HIS SOVEREIGN LADY RUSHED OUT OF THE CASTLE THREW HIS SWORD AND HIS SHIELD TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT RAN FURIOUSLY INTO THE WOODS AND DISAPPEARED
AND THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO SET HER RIGHT HE THEREFORE RETURNED COMPELLED MALEAGANS TO RELEASE HIS PRISONERS
AND PERCEVAL IN RETURN GAVE HIM SUCH INFORMATION AS HE HAD THEN PERCEVAL RETURNED TO HIS MOTHER AND SAID TO HER MOTHER THOSE WERE NOT ANGELS BUT HONORABLE KNIGHTS THEN HIS MOTHER SWOONED AWAY
AND PERCEVAL WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY KEPT THE HORSES THAT CARRIED FIREWOOD AND PROVISIONS FOR THE CASTLE AND HE TOOK A BONY PIEBALD HORSE WHICH SEEMED TO HIM THE STRONGEST OF THEM AND HE PRESSED A PACK INTO THE FORM OF A SADDLE
FOR IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE VENTURED ON SO DARING AN OUTRAGE UNLESS HE POSSESSED SUCH POWERS THROUGH MAGIC OR CHARMS THAT NONE COULD BE ABLE TO PUNISH HIM JUST THEN BEHOLD
PERCEVAL ENTERED THE HALL UPON THE BONY PIEBALD HORSE WITH HIS UNCOUTH TRAPPINGS IN THE CENTRE OF THE HALL STOOD KAY THE SENESCHAL TELL ME TALL MAN SAID PERCEVAL IS THAT ARTHUR YONDER
THEN ALL THE HOUSEHOLD BEGAN TO JEER AND LAUGH AT HIM BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN DAMSEL WHO HAD BEEN A WHOLE YEAR AT ARTHUR'S COURT
TILL SHE HAD SEEN HIM WHO WOULD BE THE FLOWER OF CHIVALRY NOW THIS DAMSEL CAME UP TO PERCEVAL AND TOLD HIM SMILING THAT IF HE LIVED HE WOULD BE ONE OF THE BRAVEST AND BEST OF KNIGHTS TRULY SAID KAY
AND UNLESS HE DO SO QUICKLY I WILL NOT WAIT FOR HIM BY MY FAITH SAID PERCEVAL CHOOSE THOU WHETHER IT SHALL BE WILLINGLY OR UNWILLINGLY FOR I WILL HAVE THE HORSE AND THE ARMS AND THE GOBLET
VERILY SAID SIR OWAIN THE SON OF URIEN TO KAY THE SENESCHAL THOU WAST ILL ADVISED TO SEND THAT MADMAN AFTER THE KNIGHT FOR HE MUST EITHER BE OVERTHROWN OR FLEE AND EITHER WAY IT WILL BE A DISGRACE TO ARTHUR AND HIS WARRIORS
AND URGED ON HIS HORSE WITH A STICK THEN OWAIN WOULD HAVE HAD HIM RETURN TO THE COURT TO RECEIVE THE PRAISE THAT WAS HIS DUE BUT PERCEVAL SAID I WILL NOT COME TO THE COURT TILL I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE TALL MAN THAT IS THERE
TO REVENGE THE INJURY HE DID TO THE MAIDEN BUT TAKE THOU THE GOBLET TO QUEEN GUENEVER AND TELL KING ARTHUR THAT WHEREVER I AM I WILL BE HIS VASSAL AND WILL DO HIM WHAT PROFIT AND SERVICE I CAN AND SIR OWAIN
AND THE HOARY HEADED MAN RECEIVED PERCEVAL COURTEOUSLY AND ASKED HIM TO SIT BY HIM ON THE CUSHION WHEN IT WAS TIME THE TABLES WERE SET AND THEY WENT TO MEAT AND WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THEIR MEAT THE HOARY HEADED MAN ASKED PERCEVAL
IF THOU SEEST AUGHT TO CAUSE THY WONDER ASK NOT THE MEANING OF IT IF NO ONE HAS THE COURTESY TO INFORM THEE THE REPROACH WILL NOT FALL UPON THEE BUT UPON ME THAT AM THY TEACHER
NOW THE CUP THAT PERCEVAL SAW WAS THE SANGREAL AND THE SPEAR THE SACRED SPEAR AND AFTERWARDS KING PECHEUR REMOVED WITH THOSE SACRED RELICS INTO A FAR COUNTRY ONE EVENING
I WILL GO AND LEARN WHO HE IS
IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AS AGREEABLE TO THEE AS IT WOULD BE TO ME I WOULD CONVERSE WITH THEE I HAVE ALSO A MESSAGE FROM ARTHUR UNTO THEE TO PRAY THEE TO COME AND VISIT HIM
HIM WHOM THOU HAST SOUGHT SO LONG WELCOME UNTO THEE CHIEFTAIN SAID ARTHUR AND HEREUPON THERE CAME THE QUEEN AND HER HANDMAIDENS AND PERCEVAL SALUTED THEM AND THEY WERE REJOICED TO SEE HIM AND BADE HIM WELCOME
I WILL NOT LET THEE GO EXCEPT THOU BLESS ME AND THUS IT WAS WITH ELSIE SHE KNEW NOW THAT HER FATHER WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO REAL LOVE FOR JESUS NONE OF THE TRUE FEAR OF GOD BEFORE HIS EYES
SHE REPLIED THE SWEET LITTLE FACE ALL SUFFUSED WITH BLUSHES AND THE SOFT DOWNCAST EYES FILLING WITH TEARS WHY DO YOU THINK SO HE ASKED AGAIN
I THINK THERE IS A TEXT THAT SAYS YOU MUST BE ABLE ALWAYS TO GIVE A REASON FOR THE HOPE THAT IS IN YOU OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT IS THERE NOT YES SIR BE READY ALWAYS TO GIVE AN ANSWER TO EVERY MAN THAT ASKETH YOU A REASON OF THE HOPE THAT IS IN YOU
BLUSHING DEEPLY WOULD HAVE RETIRED IMMEDIATELY BUT HER FATHER HELD HER FAST SAYING AS HE GAVE HIS STEPMOTHER AN ANGRY GLANCE YOU NEED NOT GO ELSIE UNLESS YOU CHOOSE I AM QUITE CAPABLE OF JUDGING WHEN IT IS TIME TO SEND YOU TO BED
THE YOUNG PARTY AT ROSELANDS HAD NOW GROWN SO LARGE SEVERAL ADDITIONS HAVING BEEN MADE TO IT ON MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING THAT A SEPARATE TABLE WAS ORDERED TO BE SPREAD FOR THEM IN THE NURSERY WHERE THEY TOOK THEIR MEALS TOGETHER
WE WERE ALL SO SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO LEAVE US SO SOON LAST NIGHT WE HAD LOTS OF FUN AFTER YOU LEFT I THINK YOUR PAPA MIGHT HAVE LET YOU STAY UP A LITTLE LONGER BUT HE HAS PROMISED THAT TONIGHT AS WE ARE TO HAVE THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND EVER SO MUCH WILL BE GOING ON
SUPPLIED HARRY CARRINGTON AN OLDER BROTHER OF LUCY'S WITH A BOOK AND TWO YOUNGER BOYS WITH DISSECTED MAPS TO ARRANGE THE FOUR GIRLS SAT DOWN IN A CIRCLE ON THE CARPET AND BEGAN THEIR GAME FOR A FEW MOMENTS ALL WENT ON SMOOTHLY
WHO WAS SOBBING AND WIPING HER EYES WITH THE CORNER OF HER APRON ENNA TOOK MY BLOCKS SOBBED THE CHILD
PLEASE BE CAREFUL OF IT FOR I HAVE HAD IT A LONG WHILE AND PRIZE IT VERY MUCH BECAUSE MY GUARDIAN GAVE IT TO ME WHEN I WAS A VERY LITTLE GIRL AND HE IS DEAD NOW I WON'T BREAK IT ELSIE INDEED I WON'T REPLIED FLORA CONFIDENTLY
MISTER DINSMORE PASSED OUT OF ONE DOOR WHILE ELSIE LEFT BY THE OTHER THE THREE LITTLE GIRLS LOOKED INQUIRINGLY INTO EACH OTHER'S FACES WHAT IS THE MATTER WHAT HAS ELSIE DONE ASKED CARRY IN A WHISPER I DON'T KNOW
BUT AT LENGTH IT SUDDENLY CAME TO HER RECOLLECTION THAT ONCE SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THIS HER FATHER HAD FOUND HER SITTING ON THE CARPET AND HAD BADE HER GET UP IMMEDIATELY AND SIT ON A CHAIR OR STOOL SAYING NEVER LET ME SEE YOU SITTING ON THE FLOOR ELSIE
AND THEN KNEELING DOWN SHE ASKED FORGIVENESS OF GOD A FULL HOUR SHE HAD BEEN THERE ALONE AND THE TIME HAD SEEMED VERY LONG WHEN AT LAST THE DOOR OPENED AND HER FATHER CAME IN ELSIE ROSE AND CAME FORWARD TO MEET HIM
NATURAL RINGLETS I'M SURE ARE THEY NOT YES MA'AM ELSIE ANSWERED SIMPLY WISHING FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART THAT THE LADY WOULD RELEASE HER AND TALK TO SOME ONE ELSE BUT THE LADY HAD NO SUCH INTENTION YOU ARE A
BUT HAD IT NOT LUCY WHO WAS STANDING AT THE WINDOW TURNED QUICKLY ROUND COME GIRLS SHE SAID LET US RUN OUT AND SEE THEM OFF THEY'RE BRINGING UP THE HORSES
NO LUCY I MUST OBEY MY FATHER ELSIE ANSWERED IN A VERY PLEASANT BUT NO LESS DECIDED TONE SOME ONE CAUGHT HER ROUND THE WAIST AND LIFTED HER UP OH PAPA SHE EXCLAIMED I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE THERE
WHO PASSED IN AND OUT WITH AN AIR OF MYSTERY AND IMPORTANCE AND GENERALLY LADEN WITH SOME ODD LOOKING BUNDLE WHEN GOING IN WHICH THEY INVARIABLY LEFT BEHIND ON COMING OUT AGAIN AND MANY A WHISPERED CONSULTATION HAD BEEN HELD AS TO WHAT WAS PROBABLY GOING ON IN THERE
ELSIE AND CARRY SEEMED TO BE IN THE SECRET BUT ONLY SMILED AND SHOOK THEIR HEADS WISELY WHEN QUESTIONED BUT AT LENGTH TEA BEING OVER AND ALL BOTH OLD AND YOUNG ASSEMBLED AS IF BY COMMON CONSENT IN THE DRAWING ROOM IT BEGAN TO BE WHISPERED ABOUT
AND WITH ITS MYRIAD OF LIGHTED TAPERS AND ITS LOAD OF TOYS AND BONBONS INTERSPERSED WITH MANY A RICHER AND MORE COSTLY GIFT MADE QUITE A DISPLAY BEAUTIFUL
AND WAS JUST BEGINNING TO WONDER WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER PAPA'S PROMISED PRESENT WHEN SHE HEARD HER NAME AGAIN AND ADELAIDE TURNING TO HER WITH A PLEASED LOOK SLIPPED A MOST BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND RING ON HER FINGER FROM YOUR PAPA SHE SAID
THANK YOU DEAR PAPA THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOES IT PLEASE YOU MY DARLING HE ASKED STOOPING TO PRESS A KISS ON THE LITTLE UPTURNED FACE SO BRIGHT AND HAPPY YES PAPA
THEN LEAPED TO THE VERY BRIM OF THE BOWL A LARK HAD RISEN FROM THE ROOF OF ONE OF THE SHATTERED HEAPS AND HAD FLOWN CAROLING UP INTO THE SHADOWY SKY A FLOCK OF THE LITTLE WILLOW WARBLERS FLUNG THEMSELVES ACROSS THE VALLEY SCOLDING AND GOSSIPING
A HARE SAT UPRIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ANCIENT ROADWAY THE VALLEY ITSELF LAY SERENELY UNDER THE AMBERING LIGHT SMILING PEACEFUL EMPTIED OF HORROR
A RIFLE SHOT RANG OUT ABOVE US ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FROM THE PORTAL SCAMPERED CHIU MING HIS ROBE TUCKED UP ABOUT HIS KNEES THEY COME HE GASPED THEY COME
WE DROPPED UPON OUR KNEES SENT SHOT AFTER SHOT INTO THEM THEY FELL BACK HESITATED WE SPRANG UP SPED ON ALL TOO SHORT WAS THE CHECK BUT ONCE MORE WE HELD THEM AND AGAIN NOW RUTH AND DICK WERE A SCANT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE CREVICE I SAW HIM STOP
OVER US WHINED THE BULLETS FROM THE COVERING GUNS CLOSE WERE WE NOW TO THE MOUTH OF THE FISSURE IF WE COULD BUT REACH IT CLOSE CLOSE WERE OUR PURSUERS TOO THE ARROWS CLOSER NO USE SAID VENTNOR
THEIR BOWS AND JAVELINS AND SHORT BRONZE SWORDS THEIR PIKES AND SHIELDS AND UNDER THEIR ROUND HELMETS THEIR CRUEL BEARDED FACES WHITE AS OUR OWN WHERE THE BLACK BEARDS DID NOT COVER THEM THEIR FIERCE AND MOCKING EYES
IN THIS WORLD OF OURS TWENTY CENTURIES BEYOND THEIR TIME SWIFTLY ACCURATELY EVEN AS I SCANNED THEM WE HAD BEEN DRILLING INTO THEM THEY ADVANCED DELIBERATELY HEEDLESS OF THEIR FALLEN THEIR ARROWS HAD CEASED TO FLY
WHAT WAS IT AT WHICH THEY WERE GLARING OVER OUR HEADS AND WHY HAD THE RIFLE FIRE OF RUTH AND DRAKE CEASED SO ABRUPTLY SIMULTANEOUSLY WE TURNED WITHIN THE BLACK BACKGROUND OF THE FISSURE STOOD A SHAPE AN APPARITION
THE WOMAN STEPPED FROM THE CREVICE NOT FIFTY FEET FROM HER WERE RUTH AND DRAKE AND CHIU MING THEIR RIGID ATTITUDES REVEALING THE SAME SHOCK OF AWE THAT HAD MOMENTARILY PARALYZED ME SHE LOOKED AT THEM BECKONED THEM
WITH AMUSEMENT BEFORE THEY COULD COVER A HUNDRED YARDS IT HAD DISINTEGRATED I HEARD THE LITTLE WAILING SOUNDS THEN BEHIND THE FLEEING MEN CLOSE BEHIND THEM ROSE THE ANGLED PILLAR INTO PLACE SPRANG THE FLEXING ARMS AND AGAIN IT TOOK ITS TOLL OF THEM
THEY HAD NO BOWS THESE MEN THEY MOVED SWIFTLY DOWN UPON US IN SILENCE SWORDS AND PIKES GLEAMING THE SMITING THING ROCKED TOWARD US THE METAL TENTACLE STRAINING OUT LIKE A RIGID RACING SERPENT FLYING TO CUT BETWEEN ITS WEIRD MISTRESS AND THOSE WHO MENACED HER
I SAW A SPEAR THROWN IT STRUCK THE CHINAMAN SQUARELY IN THE BREAST HE TOTTERED FELL UPON HIS KNEES EVEN AS HE DROPPED THE GIANT FLAIL SWEPT DOWN UPON THE SOLDIERS IT SWEPT THROUGH THEM LIKE A SCYTHE THROUGH RIPE GRAIN
AT THE SIDE OF THE CREVICE STOOD THE WOMAN HER GAZE RESTING UPON DRAKE HIS ARMS ABOUT RUTH HER HEAD HIDDEN ON HIS BREAST THE VALLEY WAS EMPTY SAVE FOR THE HUDDLED HEAPS THAT DOTTED IT
HIGH UP IN THE DARKENING HEAVENS THE LAMMERGEIERS THE WINGED SCAVENGERS OF THE HIMALAYAS WERE GATHERING THE WOMAN LIFTED HER HAND BECKONED US ONCE MORE SLOWLY WE WALKED TOWARD HER STOOD BEFORE HER
DWELT CURIOUSLY UPON THE RED BRAND ACROSS VENTNOR'S FOREHEAD
FROM NORHALA OF COURSE I LOOKED FOR NO PERCEPTION OF ANY OF THIS BUT FROM RUTH MY REACTION GREW
RUTH CRIED DRAKE AND SPRANG TOWARD THEM SHE PAID NO HEED AND EVEN AS HE LEAPED HE WAS CAUGHT WHIRLED BACK AGAINST US WAIT SAID VENTNOR
THERE WAS A CURIOUS UNDERSTANDING IN HIS VOICE A CURIOUS SYMPATHY TOO IN THE PATIENT UNTROUBLED GAZE THAT DWELT UPON HIS SISTER AND THIS WEIRDLY EXQUISITE WOMAN WHO HELD HER WAIT EXCLAIMED DRAKE WAIT HELL THE DAMNED WITCH IS STEALING HER AWAY FROM US
LIKE METAL WAVES BACK INTO IT RUSHED THE ENIGMATIC BILLOWS THAT HAD WASHED OVER THE FRAGMENTS OF THE CITY WE WERE LIFTED BETWEEN US AND THE WOMAN AND GIRL A CLEFT APPEARED IT WIDENED INTO A RIFT
QUIETLY IT GLIDED TO THE CHASM IT HAD BLASTED IN THE CLIFF WALL THE SHADOW OF THOSE WALLS FELL UPON US AS ONE WE LOOKED BACK AS ONE WE SEARCHED OUT THE PATCH OF BLUE WITH THE BLACK BLOT AT ITS BREAST WE FOUND IT THEN THE PRECIPICES HID IT
THE THING QUIETED IT BEGAN ITS STEADY EFFORTLESS STRIDING THROUGH THE CROWDING TREES BUT NOW WITH NONE OF THAT SPEED WITH WHICH IT HAD COME SPURRED FORWARD BY NORHALA'S AWAKENED HATE VENTNOR STIRRED
BUT THIS I DO KNOW ONLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER CAN THE BALANCE FALL AND IF IT BE ONE WAY THEN YOU AND WE SHALL HAVE RUTH BACK AND IF IT FALLS THE OTHER WAY THEN THERE WILL BE LITTLE NEED FOR US TO CARE FOR MAN WILL BE DONE MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT IS THE CRISIS HE ANSWERED WE CAN DO NOTHING GOODWIN NOTHING WHATEVER IS TO BE STEPS FORTH NOW FROM THE WOMB OF DESTINY AGAIN THERE CAME THAT DISTANT ROLLING LOUDER NOW AGAIN THE THING TREMBLED
THESE CREATURES THAT WHEN MANY STILL ARE ONE THAT WHEN ONE STILL ARE MANY WHENCE DID THEY COME WHAT ARE THEY HE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE CUBES THAT HELD US THEIR HOSTS OF TINY EYES SHONE UP AT HIM ENIGMATICALLY
AS I TOLD YOU OR THINK I TOLD YOU SPEAKING WITH UNTHINKABLE EFFORT THROUGH LIPS THAT SEEMED ETERNITIES AWAY FROM ME THE ATOM WHO STROVE TO OPEN THEM
THE PORTRESS AFTER HAVING ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY QUESTION AS TO WHETHER HER MISTRESS WAS AT HOME OPENED THE FOLDING DOORS OF A ROOM TO THE LEFT AND HAVING USHERED ME IN CLOSED THEM BEHIND ME I FOUND MYSELF IN A SALON
THIS ROOM WAS CARPETED AND THEREIN WAS A PIANO A COUCH A CHIFFONNIERE
YES SHE SAID SHE OFTEN THOUGHT SO AND ADDED
COME TO THE WINDOW AND TAKE A BETTER VIEW I FOLLOWED HER SHE OPENED THE SASH AND LEANING OUT I SAW IN FULL THE ENCLOSED DEMESNE WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN TO ME AN UNKNOWN REGION IT WAS A LONG
WHEN I HAD TAKEN A VIEW OF HER WELL TRIMMED BEDS AND BUDDING SHRUBBERIES I ALLOWED MY GLANCE TO COME BACK TO HERSELF NOR DID I HASTILY WITHDRAW IT
AND WHEN SHE COULD NOT GET ME TO NAME A SUM SHE REASONED AND REASONED WITH A FLUENT YET QUIET CIRCUMLOCUTION OF SPEECH AND AT LAST NAILED ME DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS PER ANNUM NOT TOO MUCH BUT I AGREED
BEFORE THE NEGOTIATION WAS COMPLETED IT BEGAN TO GROW A LITTLE DUSK I DID NOT HASTEN IT FOR I LIKED WELL ENOUGH TO SIT AND HEAR HER TALK I WAS AMUSED WITH THE SORT OF BUSINESS TALENT SHE DISPLAYED EDWARD COULD NOT HAVE SHOWN HIMSELF MORE PRACTICAL
BECAUSE AS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL THINGS THERE WAS NO FURTHER GROUND FOR THE EXERCISE OF HER PARTS OF SPEECH I WAS OBLIGED TO RISE I WOULD RATHER HAVE SAT A LITTLE LONGER WHAT HAD I TO RETURN TO BUT MY SMALL EMPTY ROOM
THAT THEY WERE SMOKE WHERE WAS THE GREAT GLARE OF YELLOW LIGHT THAT THE CIRCUIT RIDER HAD TOLD ABOUT AND THE LEAPING TONGUES OF FIRE WHERE WAS THE SHRIEKING MONSTER THAT RAN WITHOUT HORSES LIKE THE WIND
AND HAD BROUGHT BACK WONDERFUL STORIES OF THAT OUTER WORLD AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER MORE THAN EVER BEFORE WHETHER SHE WOULD EVER GO INTO IT AND SEE FOR HERSELF WHAT WAS THERE WITH THE THOUGHT SHE ROSE SLOWLY TO HER FEET
THAT PATH THAT COILED UNDER THE CLIFF AND RAN DOWN LOOP BY LOOP THROUGH MAJESTIC OAK AND POPLAR AND MASSES OF RHODODENDRON SHE DREW A LONG BREATH AND STIRRED UNEASILY
SHE'D BETTER GO HOME NOW BUT THE PATH HAD A SNAKE LIKE CHARM FOR HER AND STILL SHE STOOD FOLLOWING IT AS FAR DOWN AS SHE COULD WITH HER EYES DOWN IT WENT
THE LITTLE CREATURE DROPPED OF A SUDDEN TO THE GROUND AND LIKE SOMETHING WILD LAY FLAT A HUMAN FIGURE HAD FILLED THE LEAFY MOUTH THAT SWALLOWED UP THE TRAIL AND IT WAS COMING TOWARDS HER
WITH A THUMPING HEART SHE PUSHED SLOWLY FORWARD THROUGH THE BRUSH UNTIL HER FACE FOX LIKE WITH CUNNING AND SCREENED BY A BLUEBERRY BUSH HUNG JUST OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND THERE SHE LAY
NOW BOTH MAN AND HORSE HAD STOPPED THE STRANGER HAD TAKEN OFF HIS GRAY SLOUCHED HAT AND HE WAS WIPING HIS FACE WITH SOMETHING WHITE SOMETHING BLUE WAS TIED LOOSELY ABOUT HIS THROAT
WHICH WAS DEEP IN SEAT HIGH BOTH IN FRONT AND BEHIND AND HAD STRANGE LONG HOODED STIRRUPS STARTING TO MOUNT THE MAN STOPPED WITH ONE FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS HER SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE SHRANK BACK AGAIN
HOW COULD HE GET A FISH OUT WITH THAT LITTLE SWITCH SHE THOUGHT CONTEMPTUOUSLY BY AND BY SOMETHING HUMMED QUEERLY THE MAN GAVE A SLIGHT JERK AND A SHINING FISH FLOPPED TWO FEET INTO THE AIR IT WAS SURELY VERY QUEER
THE GIRL SHRANK TO THE BUSHES BUT SHE CRIED SHARPLY BACK DON'T YOU HURT HIM NOW DAD HE AIN'T EVEN GOT A PISTOL HE AIN'T NO SHET UP
THE MOUNTAINEER'S BUSHY BROWS CAME TOGETHER ACROSS THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE AND HIS VOICE RUMBLED LIKE DISTANT THUNDER WHAT'S YO NAME STRANGER AN WHAT'S YO BUSINESS OVER HYEH DEAR ME THERE YOU GO YOU CAN SEE I'M FISHING
BUT WHY DOES EVERYBODY IN THESE MOUNTAINS WANT TO KNOW MY NAME YOU HEERD ME YES THE FISHERMAN TURNED AGAIN AND SAW THE GIANT'S RUGGED FACE STERN AND PALE WITH OPEN ANGER NOW
I MIGHT HAVE A GUN MYSELF SOMETIMES DID YOU THINK YOU COULD SCARE ME THE MOUNTAINEER STARED IN GENUINE SURPRISE TWUSN'T NO JOKE HE SAID SHORTLY
I RECKON YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I BE I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE AGAIN THE MOUNTAINEER STARED NO USE GITTIN MAD YOUNG FELLER HE SAID COOLLY I MISTAKEN YE FER SOMEBODY ELSE AN I AXE YER PARDON
HE LIKED THAT AND HER HAIR IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE GOLD BRONZE ON THE WING OF A WILD TURKEY THAT HE HAD SHOT THE DAY BEFORE WELL IT WAS NOON NOW THE FISH HAD STOPPED BITING AFTER THE WAYWARD FASHION OF BASS
AND THEN SHE SAID IN A COMMANDING UNDERTONE GO ON BILLY
THE OLD MAN REMONSTRATING IN THE KINDLIEST WAY THE OLD WOMAN SILENTLY PUFFING HER PIPE AND MAKING NO ANSWER EXCEPT TO FLAY GENTLY THE RUMP OF THE LAZY OLD GRAY HESITATING HARDLY A MOMENT HALE UNJOINTED HIS POLE
GEE HAW I TELL YE AN OX WAGON EVIDENTLY WAS COMING ON AND THE ROAD WAS SO NARROW THAT HE TURNED HIS HORSE INTO THE BUSHES TO LET IT PASS
STILL THERE WAS NO SOUND OF OX OR WAGON AND THE VOICE SOUNDED LIKE A CHILD'S SO HE WENT ON AT A WALK IN THE THICK SAND AND WHEN HE TURNED THE BUSHES HE PULLED UP AGAIN WITH A LOW LAUGH
VILLONA WAS ENTERTAINING ALSO A BRILLIANT PIANIST BUT UNFORTUNATELY VERY POOR THE CAR RAN ON MERRILY WITH ITS CARGO OF HILARIOUS YOUTH THE TWO COUSINS SAT ON THE FRONT SEAT JIMMY AND HIS HUNGARIAN FRIEND SAT BEHIND
BUT JIMMY WHO IN SPITE OF TEMPORARY ERRORS WAS AT HEART THE INHERITOR OF SOLID INSTINCTS KNEW WELL WITH WHAT DIFFICULTY IT HAD BEEN GOT TOGETHER THIS KNOWLEDGE HAD PREVIOUSLY KEPT HIS BILLS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF REASONABLE RECKLESSNESS
JIMMY SET OUT TO TRANSLATE INTO DAYS WORK THAT LORDLY CAR IN WHICH HE SAT HOW SMOOTHLY IT RAN IN WHAT STYLE THEY HAD COME CAREERING ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS THE JOURNEY LAID A MAGICAL FINGER ON THE GENUINE PULSE OF LIFE
THEY TALKED VOLUBLY AND WITH LITTLE RESERVE JIMMY WHOSE IMAGINATION WAS KINDLING CONCEIVED THE LIVELY YOUTH OF THE FRENCHMEN TWINED ELEGANTLY UPON THE FIRM FRAMEWORK OF THE ENGLISHMAN'S MANNER A GRACEFUL IMAGE OF HIS HE THOUGHT AND A JUST ONE
HE ADMIRED THE DEXTERITY WITH WHICH THEIR HOST DIRECTED THE CONVERSATION THE FIVE YOUNG MEN HAD VARIOUS TASTES AND THEIR TONGUES HAD BEEN LOOSENED VILLONA WITH IMMENSE RESPECT BEGAN TO DISCOVER TO THE MILDLY SURPRISED ENGLISHMAN THE BEAUTIES OF THE ENGLISH MADRIGAL
RIVIERE NOT WHOLLY INGENUOUSLY UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN TO JIMMY THE TRIUMPH OF THE FRENCH MECHANICIANS THE RESONANT VOICE OF THE HUNGARIAN WAS ABOUT TO PREVAIL IN RIDICULE OF THE SPURIOUS LUTES OF THE ROMANTIC PAINTERS
THAT NIGHT THE CITY WORE THE MASK OF A CAPITAL THE FIVE YOUNG MEN STROLLED ALONG STEPHEN'S GREEN IN A FAINT CLOUD OF AROMATIC SMOKE THEY TALKED LOUDLY AND GAILY AND THEIR CLOAKS DANGLED FROM THEIR SHOULDERS THE PEOPLE MADE WAY FOR THEM
TO A MUSIC OF MERRY BELLS
AH COME IN SIT DOWN AND THE SENATOR CLOSED THE BOOK AND LAID IT DOWN I WANTED TO SEE YOU
AND THE SENATOR BEAMED WITH HIS OWN CONGRESSIONAL WIT IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE THINGS ARE WORKING VERY WELL WE HAVE MADE EVER SO MUCH PROGRESS IN A WEEK I BELIEVE THAT YOU AND I TOGETHER COULD RUN THIS GOVERNMENT BEAUTIFULLY UNCLE THE SENATOR BEAMED AGAIN
I DON'T KNOW ANY MAN IN CONGRESS I'D SOONER GO TO FOR HELP IN ANY CHRISTIAN WORK WHAT DID HE SAY OH HE BEAT AROUND A LITTLE HE SAID HE SHOULD LIKE TO HELP THE NEGRO HIS HEART WENT OUT TO THE NEGRO AND ALL THAT PLENTY OF THEM SAY THAT BUT HE WAS A LITTLE AFRAID OF THE TENNESSEE LAND BILL
I HOPE SO HIS NAME WILL GIVE TONE AND STRENGTH TO IT I KNEW YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE TO SHOW HIM THAT IT WAS JUST AND PURE IN ORDER TO SECURE HIS CORDIAL SUPPORT I THINK I CONVINCED HIM YES I AM PERFECTLY SURE HE WILL VOTE RIGHT NOW
SONS IN LAW NOTHING LIKE A SON IN LAW HERE IN WASHINGTON OR A BROTHER IN LAW AND EVERYBODY HAS EM LET'S SEE SIXTY ONE WITH PLACES TWENTY FIVE PERSUADED IT IS GETTING ON WE'LL HAVE TWO THIRDS OF CONGRESS IN TIME DILWORTHY MUST SURELY KNOW I UNDERSTAND HIM
UNCLE DILWORTHY UNCLE BALLOON TELLS VERY AMUSING STORIES WHEN LADIES ARE NOT PRESENT I SHOULD THINK SO M M EIGHTY FIVE THERE I MUST FIND THAT CHAIRMAN QUEER BUCKSTONE ACTS
NOW COLONEL CAN YOU PICTURE JEFFERSON OR WASHINGTON OR JOHN ADAMS FRANKING THEIR WARDROBES THROUGH THE MAILS AND ADDING THE FACETIOUS IDEA OF MAKING THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARGO FOR THE SUM OF ONE DOLLAR AND FIVE CENTS STATESMEN WERE DULL CREATURES IN THOSE DAYS
YES AND BALLOON HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL OF PUBLIC EXPERIENCE HE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE HE WAS GOVERNOR OF ONE OF THE TERRITORIES A WHILE AND WAS VERY SATISFACTORY INDEED HE WAS HE WAS EX OFFICIO INDIAN AGENT TOO
OF SECURING THEIR SERVICES FEW LANDS ARE SO BLEST THAT IS TRUE COLONEL TO BE SURE YOU CAN BUY NOW AND THEN A SENATOR OR A REPRESENTATIVE BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW IT IS WRONG AND SO THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED OF IT THEY ARE GENTLE AND CONFIDING AND CHILDLIKE
I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU COLONEL SELLERS WELL HESITATED THE COLONEL I AM AFRAID SOME OF THEM DO BUY THEIR SEATS YES I AM AFRAID THEY DO BUT AS SENATOR DILWORTHY HIMSELF SAID TO ME IT IS SINFUL IT IS VERY WRONG IT IS SHAMEFUL
WERE USELESS AND UNAVAILING AND SO HE HAD COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE MUST PART FROM THOSE GENTLE TONGUED WOMEN OF HIS THOSE SWEET VOICED POETS HIS PALACES AND THEIR RICH HANGINGS THEREFORE HE HAD SUMMONED TO GIVE HIM ABSOLUTION FOR HIS SINS
AND DIVERTED THE CITIZENS FROM THE DOUBLE PATH OF MILITARY AND CIVIL LIFE WHEREIN BEFORE THEY WERE ENERVATED BY YOUR LUXURIES THEY HAD DISPLAYED THE VIRTUES OF THE ANCIENTS AND THEREFORE WHEN THE DAY SHALL DAWN WHICH IS NOT FAR DISTANT CONTINUED THE MONK
AND FOUND THEIR FRIEND CONVULSIVELY CLUTCHING IN HIS ARMS A MAGNIFICENT CRUCIFIX WHICH HE HAD JUST TAKEN DOWN FROM THE BED HEAD IN VAIN DID THEY TRY TO REASSURE HIM WITH FRIENDLY WORDS LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT ONLY REPLIED WITH SOBS
IT WAS ACCORDINGLY ARRANGED THAT I SHOULD SHOOT HIM A BUFFALO KILLING MATCH AND THE PRELIMINARIES WERE EASILY AND SATISFACTORILY AGREED UPON WE WERE TO HUNT ONE DAY OF EIGHT HOURS BEGINNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND CLOSING AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
A LARGE CROWD WITNESSED THE INTERESTING AND EXCITING SCENE AN EXCURSION PARTY MOSTLY FROM SAINT LOUIS CONSISTING OF ABOUT A HUNDRED GENTLEMEN AND LADIES CAME OUT ON A SPECIAL TRAIN TO VIEW THE SPORT AND AMONG THE NUMBER WAS MY WIFE WITH LITTLE BABY ARTA
WE CAME UP CLOSE TO ANOTHER HERD AS I WAS SO FAR AHEAD OF MY COMPETITOR IN THE NUMBER KILLED I THOUGHT I COULD AFFORD TO GIVE AN EXTRA EXHIBITION OF MY SKILL I HAD TOLD THE LADIES THAT I WOULD ON THE NEXT RUN RIDE MY HORSE WITHOUT SADDLE OR BRIDLE
WE RODE TO THE WINDWARD OF THE BUFFALOES AS USUAL AND WHEN WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF THEM WE DASHED INTO THE HERD I SOON HAD THIRTEEN LAID OUT ON THE GROUND THE LAST ONE OF WHICH I HAD DRIVEN DOWN CLOSE TO THE WAGONS WHERE THE LADIES WERE
OWING TO THE FLEETNESS OF THE EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS RIDING THIS SAD EVENT OCCURRED AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ON OUR WAY BACK TO CAMP WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE CHOICE MEAT AND FINEST HEADS
AND TO DAY THEY ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE TRAVELER ALMOST EVERYWHERE WHENEVER I AM TRAVELING OVER THE COUNTRY AND SEE ONE OF THESE TRADE MARKS I FEEL PRETTY CERTAIN THAT I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF THE OLD FELLOW WHOSE BODY IT ONCE ORNAMENTED
MY SERVICES AS A HUNTER WERE NOT ANY LONGER REQUIRED AT THIS TIME THERE WAS A GENERAL INDIAN WAR RAGING ALL ALONG THE WESTERN BORDERS GENERAL SHERIDAN HAD TAKEN UP HIS HEADQUARTERS AT FORT HAYES IN ORDER TO BE IN THE FIELD TO SUPERINTEND THE CAMPAIGN IN PERSON
AND I ACCEPTED HIS INVITATION TO RIDE OVER TO THE POST WITH HIM IN AN AMBULANCE ON THE WAY THITHER HE ASKED ME HOW I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN OFFICER'S COMMISSION IN THE REGULAR ARMY HE SAID THAT GENERAL SHERIDAN AND HIMSELF HAD HAD SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MATTER
HAVING DETERMINED TO VISIT NEW YORK I ACTED UPON GENERAL SHERIDAN'S SUGGESTION AND WROTE TO GENERAL STAGER FROM WHOM IN A FEW DAYS I RECEIVED MY RAILROAD PASSES OBTAINING THIRTY DAYS LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT I STRUCK OUT FOR THE EAST
I HAD COLLECTED A LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS OF WILD ANIMALS HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO ROCHESTER AND KINDLY VOLUNTEERED TO ACT AS MY GUIDE UNTIL WE REACHED THAT POINT WE SPENT ONE DAY IN VIEWING THE WONDERS OF NIAGARA
I FINALLY COMPROMISED THE MATTER BY AGREEING TO DIVIDE MY TIME BETWEEN THE UNION CLUB THE BREVOORT HOUSE AND NED BUNTLINE'S QUARTERS THE NEXT FEW DAYS I SPENT IN VIEWING THE SIGHTS OF NEW YORK EVERYTHING BEING NEW AND STARTLING
BOTH MISTER JEROME AND MISTER HECKSHER TOLD ME THAT I MUST NOT DISAPPOINT MISTER BELMONT FOR HIS DINNERS WERE SPLENDID AFFAIRS I MADE A NOTE OF THE DATE AND AT THE APPOINTED TIME I WAS PROMPTLY AT MISTER BELMONT'S MANSION WHERE I SPENT A VERY ENJOYABLE EVENING
MISTER BENNETT WHO WAS AMONG THE GUESTS HAVING FORGIVEN MY CARELESSNESS INVITED ME TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE LIEDERKRANZ MASKED BALL WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN A FEW EVENINGS AND WOULD BE A GRAND SPECTACLE TOGETHER WE ATTENDED THE BALL AND DURING THE EVENING I WAS WELL ENTERTAINED
YOU MUST MEAN YOUR UNCLE'S REPLIED MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS CONVINCED HE UNTWISTED THE PAPER AND SIGNED THE ARTICLE
AS SOON AS EVER HE ENTER'D UPON THE ODD FIFTY HE GENERALLY GAVE A LOUD HEM
I MEAN THE EXTERNAL ORGAN OF SMELLING OR THAT PART OF MAN WHICH STANDS PROMINENT IN HIS FACE AND WHICH PAINTERS SAY IN GOOD JOLLY NOSES AND WELL PROPORTIONED FACES SHOULD COMPREHEND A FULL THIRD THAT IS MEASURED DOWNWARDS FROM THE SETTING ON OF THE HAIR
AS A MAN IN A STATE OF NATURE PICKS UP AN APPLE IT BECOMES HIS OWN AND IF HE IS A MAN OF SPIRIT HE WOULD LOSE HIS LIFE RATHER THAN GIVE IT UP
BUT THAT WAS NOT THY TRANSGRESSION MY DEAR UNCLE HERE BUT WHY HERE RATHER THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF MY STORY I AM NOT ABLE TO TELL BUT HERE IT IS MY HEART STOPS ME
FOR THIS REASON CONTINUED MY FATHER STATING THE CASE OVER AGAIN NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE WORLD KNOWS THAT MISSUS WADMAN AFFECTS MY BROTHER TOBY AND MY BROTHER TOBY CONTRARIWISE AFFECTS MISSUS WADMAN
WITHOUT FIRST RECOMMENDING THYSELF TO THE PROTECTION OF ALMIGHTY GOD THAT HE MAY DEFEND THEE FROM THE EVIL ONE SHAVE THE WHOLE TOP OF THY CROWN CLEAN
WHATEVER THOU HAST TO SAY BE IT MORE OR LESS FORGET NOT TO UTTER IT IN A LOW SOFT TONE OF VOICE SILENCE AND WHATEVER APPROACHES IT WEAVES DREAMS OF MIDNIGHT SECRECY INTO THE BRAIN
WHILST MY FATHER WAS WRITING HIS LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL WERE BUSY IN PREPARING EVERY THING FOR THE ATTACK AS THE TURNING OF THE THIN SCARLET BREECHES WAS LAID ASIDE AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT
WHETHER TWAS A TAP OF REMONSTRANCE OR A TAP OF CONFESSION MY FATHER WHO WAS ALL SENSIBILITIES FROM HEAD TO FOOT
MY MOTHER MADAM WAS SO AT NO TIME EITHER BY NATURE BY INSTITUTION OR EXAMPLE A TEMPERATE CURRENT OF BLOOD RAN ORDERLY THROUGH HER VEINS IN ALL MONTHS OF THE YEAR
FOR CERTAINLY KEY HOLES WERE MADE FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND CONSIDERING THE ACT AS AN ACT WHICH INTERFERED WITH A TRUE PROPOSITION AND DENIED A KEY HOLE TO BE WHAT IT WAS
IT BECAME A VIOLATION OF NATURE AND WAS SO FAR YOU SEE CRIMINAL IT IS FOR THIS REASON AN PLEASE YOUR REVERENCES THAT KEY HOLES ARE THE OCCASIONS OF MORE SIN AND WICKEDNESS THAN ALL OTHER HOLES
MY UNCLE TOBY TURN'D HIS HEAD MORE THAN ONCE BEHIND HIM TO SEE HOW HE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE CORPORAL AND THE CORPORAL AS OFT AS HE DID IT GAVE A SLIGHT FLOURISH WITH HIS STICK
AND WHICH WOULD BE UTTERLY OVERTURNED AND NULLIFIED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT PREMISS MISSUS PHIPPS THE BANKER'S WIFE AND MISSUS LANDOR THE ATTORNEY'S WIFE HAD INVESTED PART OF THEIR REPUTATION FOR ACUTENESS
HAD SUBSEQUENTLY GIVEN DANCING LESSONS IN THE METROPOLIS THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN HER HALF BROTHER WHO BY UNIMPEACHED INTEGRITY AND INDUSTRY
NOT INDEED ANY VERY RIPE AND COMPREHENSIVE WISDOM BUT MUCH EXTERNAL POLISH AND CERTAIN PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS OF A VERY DECIDED KIND
SO SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD MISCALCULATED THE ADVANTAGES OF A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S PRIVATE AFFAIRS
WHO WAS THE MURDERER OF HIS BROTHER AND SENDS THAT HEAD TO HIS OTHER BROTHER PHERORAS
AND MARCHED TOWARDS JERICHO WITH FIVE COHORTS WHICH MACHAERUS SENT WITH HIM
SOON BEAT THOSE THAT OPPOSED HIM AND AFTER HE HAD BEATEN THEM HE ALWAYS TURNED HIS FORCE AGAINST THOSE THAT STOOD TO IT STILL AND PURSUED THEM ALL SO THAT A GREAT SLAUGHTER WAS MADE WHILE SOME WERE FORCED BACK INTO THAT VILLAGE WHENCE THEY CAME OUT
UPON THE CONFIDENCE OF WHICH VICTORY HEROD HAD MARCHED IMMEDIATELY TO JERUSALEM
AND THEY HAD LAIN THERE FOR SOME TIME IN GREAT TERROR AND IN PRIVACY AND WHEN THEY SAW THE KING THEY TREMBLED FOR FEAR AND RAN BY HIM IN A FLIGHT ALTHOUGH HE WAS NAKED AND ENDEAVORED TO GET OFF INTO THE PUBLIC ROAD
NOW THERE WAS BY CHANCE NOBODY ELSE AT HAND THAT MIGHT SEIZE UPON THESE MEN AND FOR HEROD HE WAS CONTENTED TO HAVE COME TO NO HARM HIMSELF SO THAT THEY ALL GOT AWAY IN SAFETY EIGHT
SOSIUS ALSO JOINED HIM WITH A LARGE ARMY BOTH OF HORSEMEN AND FOOTMEN WHICH HE SENT BEFORE HIM THROUGH THE MIDLAND PARTS WHILE HE MARCHED HIMSELF ALONG PHOENICIA AND WHEN THE WHOLE ARMY WAS GOTTEN TOGETHER
AND THESE PARTICULARLY PLUNDERED THE PLACES THAT WERE ABOUT THE CITY AND THIS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FOOD LEFT EITHER FOR THE HORSES OR THE MEN YET SOME OF THE WARLIKE MEN WHO WERE USED TO FIGHT REGULARLY WERE APPOINTED TO DEFEND THE CITY DURING THE SIEGE
THEY BORE A SIEGE OF FIVE MONTHS TILL SOME OF HEROD'S CHOSEN MEN VENTURED TO GET UPON THE WALL AND FELL INTO THE CITY AS DID SOSIUS'S CENTURIONS AFTER THEM
WHO STILL HAD A FOND DESIRE OF LIFE AND SOME FRIGID HOPES OF IT TO THE LAST BUT BY HIS COWARDLY BEHAVIOR WELL DESERVED TO DIE BY IT FOUR
HEREUPON KING HEROD DISTINGUISHED THE MULTITUDE THAT WAS IN THE CITY
AND HAD CONDUCTED ANTONY IN HIS EXPEDITION AGAINST THE PARTHIANS AS FAR AS EUPHRATES SHE CAME BY APAMIA AND DAMASCUS INTO JUDEA AND THERE DID HEROD PACIFY HER INDIGNATION AT HIM BY LARGE PRESENTS
NOW IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER THIS THAT ANTONY WAS COME BACK FROM PARTHIA
THE PART WHICH IS FIRST BORN TO LIFE IN MAN AND THAT THE OTHER PARTS AS YOUNGER BRETHREN AND SERVANTS IN HIS FAMILY HAVE A DEPENDANCE UPON IT IT IS REASON THAT THE PRINCIPAL CARE BE HAD OF IT
MUST CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AS CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS AS ALL PERSONS TO ALL KINDS OF SUPERIORS THOUGH OFTENTIMES THOSE PARENTS OR THOSE SUPERIORS
IT WAS BUT A LITTLE HELP THAT HE HAD TO MAKE OTHER THINGS OF THIS EARTH NOTHING CAN BE NEARER NOTHING THAN THIS EARTH AND YET HOW LITTLE OF THIS EARTH IS THE GREATEST MAN HE THINKS HE TREADS UPON THE EARTH
SHALL MY FEAR SHALL MY ZEAL SHALL MY JEALOUSY HAVE LEAVE TO SAY TO THEE HAST THOU CONSIDERED MY HEART THAT THERE IS NOT SO PERVERSE A HEART UPON EARTH
AND I CAN GATHER OUT OF THY WORD SO GOOD TESTIMONY OF THE HEARTS OF MEN AS TO FIND SINGLE HEARTS DOCILE AND APPREHENSIVE HEARTS HEARTS THAT CAN HEARTS THAT HAVE LEARNED
AND I HAVE NOT THAT TO THOSE OF THE OTHER KIND THOU GIVEST FAINTNESS OF HEART
THOUGH THOU FILLEST ALL YET ART OTHERWISE IN SOME ROOMS THEREOF THAN IN OTHERS OTHERWISE IN THY CHURCH THAN IN MY CHAMBER AND OTHERWISE IN THY SACRAMENTS THAN IN MY PRAYERS
THAN IN THE OTHER OFFICES INTO THE HOUSE OF THINE ANOINTED DISLOYAL PERSONS TRAITORS WILL COME INTO THY HOUSE THE CHURCH HYPOCRITES AND IDOLATORS WILL COME INTO SOME ROOMS OF THIS THY HOUSE MY BODY
ART ABLE TO MAKE THIS PRESENT SICKNESS EVERLASTING HEALTH THIS WEAKNESS EVERLASTING STRENGTH AND THIS VERY DEJECTION AND FAINTNESS OF HEART A POWERFUL CORDIAL
NEITHER DID HE LONGER DESIRE TO HOLD IT OF THEE BUT TO RECOMMEND IT TO THEE I SEE THINE HAND UPON ME NOW O LORD AND I ASK NOT WHY IT COMES WHAT IT INTENDS
BUT A SILENT AND ABSOLUTE OBEDIENCE TO THY WILL EVEN BEFORE I KNOW IT IS MY CORDIAL PRESERVE THAT TO ME O MY GOD AND THAT WILL PRESERVE ME TO THEE
WHOSE ONLY DEFECT IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR I NEED NOT TELL YOU OF THOSE WHO CHEAT AT PLAY
THE NIGHTS THAT I DID NOT SPEND IN THE RUE D'ANTIN IF I HAD SPENT THEM ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM I COULD NOT HAVE SLEPT JEALOUSY WOULD HAVE KEPT ME AWAKE AND INFLAMED MY BLOOD AND MY THOUGHTS
AS FOR HER SHE CONTINUED TO LOVE ME AS MUCH OR EVEN MORE THAN EVER AS I TOLD YOU I BEGAN BY BEING ALLOWED TO STAY ONLY FROM MIDNIGHT TO SIX O'CLOCK THEN I WAS ASKED SOMETIMES TO A BOX IN THE THEATRE
ALWAYS REPEATING THAT I WAS QUITE WELL AND THAT I WAS NOT IN NEED OF MONEY TWO THINGS WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD CONSOLE MY FATHER FOR MY DELAY IN PAYING HIM MY ANNUAL VISIT JUST THEN ONE FINE DAY IN SUMMER
PRUDENCE WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO SEEM MADE ON PURPOSE FOR DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WITH HER UNCHANGING GOOD HUMOUR AND HER ETERNAL APPETITE SHE NEVER LEFT A DULL MOMENT TO THOSE WHOM SHE WAS WITH AND WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY IN ORDERING EGGS CHERRIES MILK
STEWED RABBIT AND ALL THE REST OF THE TRADITIONAL LUNCH IN THE COUNTRY WE HAD NOW ONLY TO DECIDE WHERE WE SHOULD GO IT WAS ONCE MORE PRUDENCE WHO SETTLED THE DIFFICULTY DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE REAL COUNTRY SHE ASKED YES
THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT VIEW FROM THE GARDEN WHICH IS AT THE HEIGHT OF AN ORDINARY FIRST FLOOR ON THE LEFT THE AQUEDUCT OF MARLY CLOSES IN THE HORIZON
I HAVE TRAVELLED A GOOD DEAL AND SEEN MUCH GRANDER THINGS
AND BEHIND THE HOUSE A LITTLE WOOD FULL OF MYSTERIOUS RETREATS WHERE THE MOSS MUST EFFACE EACH MORNING THE PATHWAY THAT HAD BEEN MADE THE DAY BEFORE CLIMBING FLOWERS CLUNG ABOUT THE DOORWAY OF THIS UNINHABITED HOUSE
MOUNTING AS HIGH AS THE FIRST STORY I LOOKED AT THE HOUSE SO LONG THAT I BEGAN BY THINKING OF IT AS MINE SO PERFECTLY DID IT EMBODY THE DREAM THAT I WAS DREAMING I SAW MARGUERITE AND MYSELF THERE
BY DAY IN THE LITTLE WOOD THAT COVERED THE HILLSIDE IN THE EVENING SEATED ON THE GRASS AND I ASKED MYSELF IF EARTHLY CREATURES HAD EVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS WE SHOULD BE WHAT A PRETTY HOUSE MARGUERITE SAID TO ME
WHERE ASKED PRUDENCE YONDER AND MARGUERITE POINTED TO THE HOUSE IN QUESTION AH DELICIOUS REPLIED PRUDENCE DO YOU LIKE IT VERY MUCH
WE LEFT THE HOUSE AND STARTED ON OUR RETURN TO PARIS TALKING OVER THE NEW PLAN
BE AT PRUDENCE'S TO NIGHT AT EIGHT
I TOOK IT WAS I RIGHT I FLUNG MY ARMS AROUND HER NECK AND KISSED HER IT WILL BE CHARMING SHE CONTINUED YOU HAVE THE KEY OF THE LITTLE DOOR AND I HAVE PROMISED THE DUKE THE KEY OF THE FRONT DOOR
A WEEK LATER MARGUERITE WAS SETTLED IN HER COUNTRY HOUSE AND I WAS INSTALLED AT POINT DU JOUR THEN BEGAN AN EXISTENCE WHICH I SHALL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING TO YOU
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SPEAK TO ARMAND MARGUERITE SEEMED TO BE THINKING FOR SHE ANSWERED NOTHING MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY WHILE I WAITED FOR HER REPLY NO SHE ANSWERED I WILL NOT LEAVE ARMAND
AND I WILL NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I AM LIVING WITH HIM IT IS FOLLY NO DOUBT BUT I LOVE HIM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO AND THEN NOW THAT HE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE ALWAYS WITH ME
ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN US LEAVING THE HOUSE TO GO ON THE RIVER IN THE CHARMING LITTLE BOAT WHICH I HAD BOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE WEARING A STRAW HAT
THE DUKE WROTE TO HER TWO OR THREE TIMES SHE RECOGNISED THE WRITING AND GAVE ME THE LETTERS WITHOUT READING THEM SOMETIMES THE TERMS OF THESE LETTERS BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES HE HAD IMAGINED THAT BY CLOSING HIS PURSE TO MARGUERITE
I FEARED ABOVE ALL THAT SHE MIGHT THINK ME CAPABLE OF SHIRKING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF EVERY CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HER LOVE FOR ME MIGHT LEAD HER IT THUS CAME ABOUT THAT THE DUKE RECEIVING NO REPLY CEASED TO WRITE
MISSUS VICKERS PALE AND SICK WITH TERROR YET SUSTAINED BY THAT STRANGE COURAGE OF WHICH WE HAVE BEFORE SPOKEN PASSED RAPIDLY UNDER THE OPEN SKYLIGHT AND PREPARED TO ASCEND SYLVIA HER ROMANCE CRUSHED BY TOO DREADFUL REALITY
THE BOLD PROJECT SO BOLDLY AVOWED SEEMED TO HIM A SHEER ABSURDITY THE DANDY AND A CREW OF NINE CONVICTS NAVIGATE A BRIG ROUND THE WORLD PREPOSTEROUS WHY NOT A MAN ABOARD COULD WORK A RECKONING
IN THE BOLDNESS OF THE SPEECH HOWEVER LAY ITS SAFEGUARD REX WHOSE POLITENESS WAS MERE BRAVADO WAS STUNG TO THE QUICK BY THE REFLECTION UPON HIS COURAGE AND THE BITTER ACCENT WITH WHICH THE CHILD HAD PRONOUNCED THE WORD PRISONER
IT'S NO USE MISTER FRERE SAID THE MAN NEAREST HIM WE CAN DO NO GOOD NOW AND THEY WON'T HURT US I DARE SAY YOU DOGS YOU ARE IN LEAGUE WITH THEM BURSTS OUT FRERE PURPLE WITH INDIGNATION DO YOU MUTINY
FELL PINIONED AS HE WAS HE COULD NOT RISE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE AND RUSSEN PULLED HIM ROUGHLY TO HIS FEET WITH A COARSE LAUGH IN HIS PRESENT FRAME OF MIND THAT LAUGH GALLED HIM WORSE THAN HIS BONDS
MISTER FRERE PURPLE CLUMSY AND BOUND WAS NOT AT ALL HEROIC NOW MY LADS SAYS REX WHO SEEMED TO HAVE ENDURED THE CAST OFF AUTHORITY OF FRERE WE GIVE YOU YOUR CHOICE STAY AT HELL'S GATES OR COME WITH US
THEN REX WITH LYON AND RILEY AS A GUARD GOT INTO THE WHALE BOAT AND HAVING LOOSED THE TWO PRISONERS FROM THEIR BONDS ORDERED THEM TO TAKE THE PLACE OF RUSSEN AND FAIR THE WHALE BOAT WAS MANNED BY THE SEVEN MUTINEERS
THAT NOTHING BUT THE DESPERATE NATURE OF THE ATTEMPT COULD HAVE JUSTIFIED SO DESPERATE A MEASURE THE PERPENDICULAR CLIFFS SEEMED TO RENDER SUCH AN ATTEMPT CERTAIN DESTRUCTION BUT VETCH WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN BUILDING THE PIER AT THE NECK
SAW A WILD WASTE OF RAGING SEAS SCOOPED INTO ABYSMAL TROUGHS IN WHICH THE BULK OF A LEVIATHAN MIGHT WALLOW AT THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF THESE VALLEYS OF WATER LAY THE MUTINEERS BOAT LOOKING WITH ITS OUTSPREAD OARS LIKE SOME SIX LEGGED INSECT
FLOATING IN A POOL OF INK THE GREAT CLIFF WHOSE EVERY SCAR AND CRAG WAS AS DISTINCT AS THOUGH ITS HUGE BULK WAS BUT A YARD DISTANT SEEMED TO SHOOT OUT FROM ITS BASE TOWARDS THE STRUGGLING INSECT A BROAD FLAT STRAW THAT WAS A STRIP OF DRY LAND
BY THE RECOIL OF THE WAVES TOWARDS THEM FOR AN INSTANT ALL THOUGHT THAT THEY MUST SHARE THE FATE WHICH HAD OVERTAKEN THE UNLUCKY CONVICTS BUT BURGESS SUCCEEDED IN TRIMMING THE BOAT AND AWED BY THE PERIL HE HAD SO NARROWLY ESCAPED GAVE THE ORDER TO RETURN
AS THE MEN SET THE BOAT'S HEAD TO THE WELCOME LINE OF LIGHTS THAT MARKED THE NECK A BLACK SPOT BALANCED UPON A BLACK LINE WAS SWEPT UNDER THEIR STERN AND CARRIED OUT TO SEA AS IT PASSED THEM THIS BLACK SPOT EMITTED A CRY
FATE HAD IN RESERVE FOR THE CREW OF VILLAINS A LESS MERCIFUL DEATH THAN THAT OF DROWNING AIDED BY THE LIGHTNING AND THAT WONDERFUL GOOD LUCK WHICH URGES VILLAINY TO ITS DESTRUCTION VETCH BEACHED THE BOAT AND THE PARTY BRUISED AND BLEEDING
REACHED THE UPPER PORTION OF THE SHORE IN SAFETY OF ALL THIS NUMBER ONLY COX WAS LOST HE WAS PULLING STROKE OAR AND BEING SOMETHING OF A LAGGARD STOOD IN THE WAY OF THE CROW WHO SEEING THE IMPORTANCE OF HASTE IN PRESERVING HIS OWN SKIN PLUCKED THE MAN BACKWARDS BY THE COLLAR
HE FURTHER SAID THAT IT PRICKED HIM TO BREATHE CURSED JEMMY VETCH THE SETTLEMENT AND THE SEA AND SO IMPENITENTLY DIED BLUNT SMOKED THREE PIPES AND THEN ALTERED THE COURSE OF THE PRETTY MARY TWO POINTS TO THE EASTWARD AND RAN FOR THE COAST
THE PRETTY MARY HUGGING THE COAST AS CLOSELY AS SHE DARED CRAWLED IN THE THIN BREEZE ALL DAY AND SAW NOTHING IT WOULD BE MADNESS TO LAND AT CAPE SURVILLE FOR THE WHOLE STATION WOULD BE ON THE ALERT SO BLUNT AS NIGHT WAS FALLING
CLOTHES RETURNED BLUNT WE CAN'T BRING HIM OFF IF IT IS HIM IN HIS CANARIES HE PUTS ON THESE DUDS D'YE SEE SINKS HER MAJESTY'S LIVERY AND COMES ABOARD A SHIPWRECKED MARINER THAT'S WELL THOUGHT OF WHOSE NOTION'S THAT
AND SUCH FUEL FOR THE CAMP FIRE BROKEN LIMBS WITH JUST ENOUGH PITCH TO MAKE A CHEERFUL BLAZE AND YET BODY ENOUGH TO LAST WELL
GLAD THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED OLIVER WAS THE CARPENTER OF THE PARTY THE TENT BUILDER WOOD GETTER AND GENERAL ROUSTABOUT WHILE I THE JUNIOR WAS CHIEF COOK AND BOTTLE WASHER
SOON WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A FLEET OF SEVEN VESSELS LYING AT ANCHOR IN A LARGE BAY SEVERAL MILES IN EXTENT THE SIGHT OF THOSE SEVEN VESSELS LYING IN THE OFFING MADE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION UPON OUR MINDS
AND LOG CABINS INTENSE RIVALRY RAN BETWEEN THE TWO TOWNS UPPER AND LOWER STEILACOOM AT THIS TIME AS A RESULT THINGS WERE BOOMING
THEY SEEMED TO BE A LISTLESS LOT WITH NO THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE OR EVEN FOR THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT THE INDIANS IN THOSE DAYS SEEMED TO WORK OR PLAY BY SPURTS AND SPELLS HERE AND THERE WE SAW A FAMILY
AND THAT THE CURRENT WAS VERY STRONG WE SECURED THE SERVICES OF AN INDIAN AND HIS CANOE TO HELP US UP THE RIVER AND LEFT OUR BOAT AT THE INDIANS CAMP NEAR THE MOUTH IT TOOK A TUGGING OF TWO DAYS TO GO SIX MILES
WHILE MILLIONS WERE SEEMINGLY DANCING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER OR LEAPING IN THE AIR WE COULD FEEL THE FISH STRIKING AGAINST THE BOAT IN SUCH VAST NUMBERS THAT THEY FAIRLY MOVED IT THE LEAP IN THE AIR WAS SO HIGH
A MERE SPECK AND GROWING TO A FULL FLEDGED DEEP SEA VESSEL WITH ALL SAILS SET SCUDDING BEFORE THE WIND THE OTHER TWO WERE GRACEFULLY BEATING THEIR WAY OUT
MANY SHACKS AND CAMPS AT FIRST MISTAKEN FOR THE WHITE MEN'S HOUSES WERE FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY NATIVES THEY WERE A DRUNKEN RASCALLY RABBLE SPENDING THEIR GAINS FROM THE SALE OF FISH AND OIL
ON THEIR FISHING EXCURSIONS IN CANOES MANNED BY THIRTY MEN OR MORE AFTER SPENDING TWO OR THREE DAYS EXPLORING THE COUNTRY WE TURNED BACK TO THE BAY WHERE LAY THE SEVEN SHIPS WE HAD SEEN NEAR STEILACOOM WE REMEMBERED THE TIMBER CAMPS
MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY CENTERED ON THE QUESTION OF OUR MOVING TO A NEW HOME WHY AT OLYMPIA EGGS WERE A DOLLAR A DOZEN I SAW THEM SELLING AT THAT THE BUTTER YOU HAVE THERE WOULD BRING YOU A DOLLAR A POUND AS FAST AS YOU COULD WEIGH IT OUT
AND A MAN CAN SELL ALL THE SHINGLES HE CAN MAKE AT FOUR DOLLARS A THOUSAND I WAS OFFERED FIVE CENTS A FOOT FOR PILES IF WE HAD BUCK AND DANDY OVER THERE WE COULD MAKE TWENTY DOLLARS A DAY
OFF THE GOVERNMENT LAND OF COURSE ALL HELP THEMSELVES TO WHAT THEY WANT THEN THERE ARE THE FISH AND THE CLAMS AND OYSTERS AND BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LAND FOR THE CLAIM THAT QUESTION WAS A STUMPER THE LITTLE WIFE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT BARGAIN MADE BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED
FINDING THAT THE BOAT AND PROVISIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN AND SEEING SMOKE IN THE BIGHT
ONLY TO FIND EVERY SEMBLANCE OF A ROAD GONE I LOST MORE THAN A HALF DAY'S PRECIOUS TIME AND AGAIN WAS THROWN INTO ANXIETY LEST I HAD MISSED THE LONG SOUGHT TRAIN THE NEXT INCIDENT THAT I REMEMBER VIVIDLY WAS MY ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE COLUMBIA
JUST BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE SNAKE RIVER I HAD SEEN BUT FEW INDIANS ON THE WHOLE TRIP AND IN FACT THE CAMP I FOUND THERE ON THE BANK OF THE GREAT RIVER WAS THE FIRST I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER COMING UPON I COULD NOT INDUCE THE INDIANS TO CROSS ME OVER
THE TROUBLE HAD BEEN THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ALL ASLEEP WHILE I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY MORNING EXPENDING MY BREATH FOR NOTHING THE MAN WAS SHIRLEY ENSIGN OF OLYMPIA WHO HAD ESTABLISHED A FERRY ACROSS THE COLUMBIA RIVER AND HAD LINGERED TO SET OVER BELATED IMMIGRANTS IF ANY SHOULD COME ALONG
BUT I COULD NOT WAIT THERE FOR THEM
THEY HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE ABOUT THROUGH WITH THE JOURNEY YOU CAME TO STAY WITH US DIDN'T YOU I WANT TO BUT WHAT ABOUT MY WIFE AND THE TWO BABIES AT THE ISLAND FATHER SAID SOME ONE MUST GO AND LOOK AFTER THEM SO OLIVER WAS SENT AHEAD
TO CUT IT OUT WITH OUR DULLED FLIMSY SAW SEEMED AN ENDLESS TASK DIG DOWN BOYS SAID FATHER AND IN SHORT ORDER EVERY AVAILABLE SHOVEL WAS OUT OF THE WAGONS VERY SOON THE WAY WAS OPEN FULLY FOUR FEET DEEP AND OXEN AND WAGONS PASSED UNDER THE OBSTRUCTION
BUT BETTER FOOD WAS OBTAINABLE AND THE GOAL WAS NEAR AT HAND IT WAS A POSITIVE PLEASURE THEREFORE TO PASS OVER THE MILES ONE BY ONE
AND WAS ENLISTED AS CAPTAIN OF A COMPANY WHICH HE HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN RECRUITING LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SMITH OF WOODBURY ENTERED THE YALE LAW SCHOOL IN THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE BUT DID NOT GRADUATE
STUDIED AFTER THE WAR AT THE BERKELEY DIVINITY SCHOOL AND HAS BEEN FOR MANY YEARS RECTOR OF SAINT JOHN'S CHURCH IN BRIDGEPORT LIEUTENANT AND BREVET CAPTAIN LEWIS W MUNGER
COLONEL MACKENZIE GRADUATED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO BUT HE WAS NEVER A RESIDENT OF THE COUNTY OR OF CONNECTICUT AND HIS ONLY CONNECTION WITH EITHER WAS THROUGH HIS COMMISSION FROM GOVERNOR BUCKINGHAM
THERE ARE NOT A FEW OTHER NAMES UPON THE ROLLS OF THE REGIMENT WHICH UPON MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAN HAS BEEN POSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT CASE WOULD CERTAINLY BE ADDED TO THE LIST
AS A WHOLE THE REGIMENT WAS A BODY THOROUGHLY REPRESENTATIVE NOT ONLY OF THE ARMY OF WHICH IT WAS A FRACTION AN ARMY AS HAS BEEN OFTEN SAID UNLIKE ANY OTHER THE WORLD HAS KNOWN BUT ALSO OF THE POPULATION FROM WHICH IT WAS DRAWN
AND EVERY TOWN AMONG US HAS KNOWN SOME OF THEM EVER SINCE AMONG ITS LEADING FIGURES WHILE SOME IN QUARTERS FAR DISTANT HAVE ALSO ATTAINED TO HONORS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS THE RECORDS SHOW
HOW I HATE THE MAN WHO TALKS ABOUT THE BRUTE CREATION WITH AN UGLY EMPHASIS ON BRUTE AS FOR ME I AM PROUD OF MY CLOSE KINSHIP WITH OTHER ANIMALS
I TURNED AND ASKED WHY WHAT ABOUT THEM I WASN'T SURE WHETHER HE HAD AN IDEA OR A HEADACHE OTHER CREATURES DON'T DO IT HE REPLIED WITH A DISCOURAGED EXPRESSION
I CAN GET NO SENSE WHATEVER OF INDIVIDUAL WORTH OR OF VALUE IN MEN AS A RACE WHEN I SEE THEM LIKE THIS IT MAKES ONE ALMOST DESPAIR OF CIVILIZATION I THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR AWHILE
AND YET AT OTHER TIMES I TOO FEEL LIKE A SPECTATOR AN ALIEN BUT EVEN THEN I HAD NEVER FELT SO ALIEN OR DESPAIRING AS POTTER LET'S REMEMBER I SAID IT'S A SIMIAN CIVILIZATION
CERTAIN GROUPS SOUGHT THE HEADSHIP MANY STRANGE FORGOTTEN DYNASTIES ROSE MET DEFIANCE AND FELL IN THE END IT WAS OUR ANCESTORS WHO WON AND BECAME SIMIAN KINGS AND BEQUEATHED A WHOLE PLANET TO US
IT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO CONSIDER THE TREND OF EVENTS WE SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO APPRAISE THE DIFFERENT SPECIES AS THEY WANDERED AROUND EACH WITH ITS OWN SET OF GOOD AND BAD CHARACTERISTICS WHICH GROUP WE'D HAVE WONDERED WOULD EVER CONTRIVE TO RULE ALL THE REST
THEY ARE NOT EASILY LEFT BEHIND EVEN AFTER LONG STAGES AND THEY FORM A TERRIBLE OBSTACLE TO ALL HIGH ADVANCEMENT
THE BEES OR THE ANTS MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO US MORE PROMISING THEIR SMALLNESS OF SIZE WAS NOT NECESSARILY TOO MUCH OF A HANDICAP THEY COULD HAVE MADE POISON THEIR WEAPON FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF RIVALS
IN A CIVILIZATION OF SUPER ANTS OR BEES THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO PROBLEM OF THE HUNGRY UNEMPLOYED NO POVERTY NO UNSTABLE GOVERNMENT NO RIOTS NO STRIKES FOR SHORT HOURS
AN ANT DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTE APPARENTLY HE JUST HAS HIS DUTIES THIS QUALITY MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR HAVING GROUPS WARS THE EGOTISM OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL SPIRITS IS ALLOWED SCANT EXPRESSION
A THOUGHTFUL OBSERVER WOULD HAVE WEIGHED ALL THESE EXCELLENT QUALITIES WHEN WE THINK OF THESE CREATURES AS LITTLE MEN WHICH IS ALL WRONG OF COURSE WE SEE THEY HAVE THEIR FAULTS TO OUR EYES THEY SEEM TOO ORDERLY FOR INSTANCE
THEY CAN'T BEAR TO STOP THEY KEEP RIGHT ON WORKING THIS MEANS THAT ANTS DO NOT CONTEMPLATE THEY HEED NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN LITTLE ROUNDS IT IS ALMOST AS THOUGH THEIR FONDNESS FOR LABOR HAD CLOSED FAST THEIR MINDS
LOVING US THEY LET US STOP THEIR DEVELOPING IN TUNE WITH THEIR NATURES AND THEY'VE PATIENTLY TRIED EVER SINCE TO ADOPT WAYS OF OURS THEY HAVE DONE IT TOO BUT OF COURSE THEY CAN'T GET FAR IT'S NOT THEIR OWN ROAD
AND GROSSNESS DELAYS ONE'S ACHIEVEMENT IT TAKES SO MUCH TIME THE SNAKE TOO THOUGH WISE HAS A WAY OF EATING HIMSELF INTO STUPORS IF SUPER SNAKE MEN HAD HAD BANQUETS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO VAST TO DESCRIBE
SO THE ELEPHANTS COLUMBUS MAY HAVE FOUND SOME ROAD HERE BEFORE OURS THEY ARE COSMOPOLITANS THESE SUAVE AND WELL BRED BEINGS THEY HAVE RICH EMOTIONAL NATURES LONG MEMORIES LOYALTY THEY ARE STEADY AND SURE
AND NOT NARROW NOT SELF ABSORBED FOR THEY SEEM INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING WHAT WAS IT THEN THAT PUT THEM OUT OF THE RACE COULD IT HAVE BEEN A QUITE NATURAL BELIEF THAT THEY HAD ALREADY WON AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY HADN'T
MORE LIVE AND LET LIVE IN ALLOWING OTHER SPECIES TO STAY HERE OUR WAY IS TO KILL GOOD AND BAD MALE AND FEMALE AND BABIES TILL THE FEW LAST SURVIVORS LIE HIDDEN AWAY FROM OUR GUNS
THEN NO MATTER HOW HARMLESS WE TREAT THEM AS OUTLAWS AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE SPECIALLY WELL BROUGHT UP SHOOT THEM FOR FUN SOME MIGHT BE OUR FRIENDS WE DON'T WISH IT WE KEEP THEM ALL TERRORIZED
HAS EVER HAD THAT MUCH BRAINS IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT OTHER OBVIOUS LESSONS MAY STILL BE UNLEARNED IT IS NOT NECESSARILY STUPID HOWEVER TO FAIL TO USE TOOLS TO USE TOOLS INVOLVES USING REASON
SOME QUENCHLESS DESIRE TO URGE THEM ON AND ON AND ALSO ADAPTABILITY OF A THOUSAND KINDS TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT THE RHINOCEROS CARES LITTLE FOR ADAPTABILITY HE SLOGS THROUGH THE WORLD BUT WE
BACK OF IT THERE MUST BE SOME SPUR TO MAKE US USE OUR ADROITNESS WHY DON'T WE ALL DIE OR GIVE UP WHEN WE'RE SICK OF THE WORLD BECAUSE THE LOVE OF LIFE IS REENFORCED IN MOST ENERGIZED BEINGS
BY SOME LONGING THAT PUSHES THEM FORWARD IN DEFEAT AND IN DARKNESS ALL CREATURES WISH TO LIVE AND TO PERPETUATE THEIR SPECIES OF COURSE BUT THOSE TWO WISHES ALONE EVIDENTLY DO NOT CARRY ANY RACE FAR
IN ADDITION TO THESE A RACE TO BE GREAT NEEDS SOME HUNGER SOME ITCH TO SPUR IT UP THE HARD PATH WE LATELY HAVE LEARNED TO CALL EVOLUTION THE LOVE OF TOIL IN THE ANTS AND OF CRAFT IN CATS ARE EXAMPLES
SAGACIOUS BOLD AND RESTLESS HE PUSHED HIS WAY FROM TOWN TO TOWN AND PRETENDED TO HAVE REACHED THE MYSTERIOUS MOUNTAINS OF APPALACHE HE SENT TO THE FORT MANTLES WOVEN WITH FEATHERS QUIVERS COVERED WITH CHOICE FURS
ARROWS TIPPED WITH GOLD WEDGES OF A GREEN STONE LIKE BERYL OR EMERALD AND OTHER TROPHIES OF HIS WANDERINGS A GENTLEMAN NAMED GROTAUT TOOK UP THE QUEST AND PENETRATED TO THE DOMINIONS OF HOSTAQUA
A HUMBLER ADVENTURER WAS PIERRE GAMBIE A ROBUST AND DARING YOUTH
WITH THRICE THE FORCE DEMANDED THREE HUNDRED THIRNAGOAS AND THIRTY FRENCHMEN TOOK UP THEIR MARCH THROUGH THE PINE BARRENS OUTINA'S CONJURER WAS OF THE NUMBER AND HAD WELLNIGH RUINED THE ENTERPRISE
COULD THEIR EYES HAVE PIERCED THE FUTURE THE INDIANS HAD LEFT THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT FROM TIME TO TIME BROUGHT IN MEAGRE SUPPLIES OF FISH WHICH THEY SOLD TO THE FAMISHED SOLDIERS AT EXORBITANT PRICES
THE SPRING WORE AWAY AND NO RELIEF APPEARED ONE THOUGHT NOW ENGROSSED THE COLONISTS THAT OF RETURN TO FRANCE VASSEUR'S SHIP THE BRETON STILL REMAINED IN THE RIVER
THE MAIZE BEGAN TO RIPEN AND THIS BROUGHT SOME RELIEF BUT THE INDIANS EXASPERATED AND GREEDY SOLD IT WITH RELUCTANCE AND MURDERED TWO HALF FAMISHED FRENCHMEN WHO GATHERED A HANDFUL IN THE FIELDS
WAITED TWO DAYS AND THEN DESCENDED THE RIVER WITH HIS PRISONER
HE MUST VANISH OUT OF THE WORLD
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME MISTER FINN I DON'T SEE THAT THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY USED TO BE THEY TELL ME AT THE PEOPLE'S BANNER OFFICE THAT THE LORDS HAVE HAD AS MUCH TO DO WITH THIS ELECTION AS WITH ANY THAT EVER WENT BEFORE IT
BUT WHEN WE READ OF CHURCHES AS IS CALLED STATE CHURCHES CHURCHES AS HAVE BISHOPS YOU AND I HAVE TO PAY FOR AS NEVER GOES INTO THEM BUT WE DON'T PAY THE BISHOPS MISTER BUNCE OH YES WE DO BECAUSE IF THEY WASN'T PAID
WHICH HE USED TO KNOW SO WELL A HUNDRED MEMORIES OF FORMER DAYS CROWDED BACK UPON HIM LORD CHILTERN FOR A FEW MONTHS HAD LIVED WITH HIM AND THEN THERE HAD ARISEN A QUARREL WHICH HE HAD FOR A TIME THOUGHT WOULD DISSOLVE HIS OLD LIFE INTO RUIN
NOW LORD CHILTERN WAS AGAIN HIS VERY INTIMATE FRIEND AND THERE HAD USED TO SIT A NEEDY MONEY LENDER WHOM
HE HAD LEFT ALL THOSE THINGS OF HIS OWN FREE WILL AS THOUGH TELLING HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS A BETTER LIFE THAN THEY OFFERED TO HIM BUT WAS HE SURE THAT HE HAD FOUND IT TO BE BETTER HE HAD CERTAINLY SIGHED FOR THE GAUDS WHICH HE HAD LEFT
I AM AFRAID THAT MISSUS LOW WHEN SHE ALLOWED HERSELF TO SPEAK THUS ENERGETICALLY ENTERTAINED SOME CONFUSED IDEA THAT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION WERE ONE AND THE SAME THING OR AT LEAST THAT THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD TOGETHER
THE IDEA OF A STATE CHURCH SAID PHINEAS IS OPPOSED TO MY THEORY OF POLITICAL PROGRESS WHAT I HOPE IS THAT MY FRIENDS WILL NOT SUPPOSE THAT I ATTACK THE PROTESTANT CHURCH BECAUSE I AM A ROMAN CATHOLIC IF I WERE A PRIEST
I HAVE HEARD WITH GREAT PLEASURE FROM MY SISTER IN LAW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN STAYING WITH THEM AT HARRINGTON HALL IT SEEMS SO LIKE OLD DAYS THAT YOU AND OSWALD AND VIOLET SHOULD BE TOGETHER SO MUCH MORE NATURAL
AND WHEN I HEAR OF YOU AT HARRINGTON HALL I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY TO THE OTHER THINGS DO TELL ME WHAT LIFE IS LIKE WITH OSWALD AND VIOLET OF COURSE HE NEVER WRITES HE IS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO ON MARRYING
AT HOME AS YOU KNOW NOT ONLY DID HE TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS BUT HE WAS ACTIVE ALSO IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OWN PROPERTY NOW IT SEEMS TO HIM TO BE ALMOST TOO GREAT A TROUBLE TO WRITE A LETTER TO HIS STEWARD
TO ME IT IS ALL ONE TRAGEDY I CANNOT BUT THINK OF THINGS AS THEY WERE TWO OR THREE YEARS SINCE MY FATHER AND MY HUSBAND WERE BOTH IN THE CABINET AND YOU YOUNG AS YOU WERE STOOD BUT ONE STEP BELOW IT OSWALD WAS OUT IN THE COLD HE WAS VERY POOR
I COMPLAIN OF NO INJUSTICE OUR CASTLE WAS BUILT UPON THE SAND WHY SHOULD MISTER KENNEDY HAVE BEEN A CABINET MINISTER AND WHY SHOULD I HAVE BEEN HIS WIFE
ON NO PRESUMPTION THAT ANY AFFECTION CAN REMAIN WITH ME HE SAYS NO WORD OF HAPPINESS HE OFFERS NO COMFORT HE DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE WITH PROMISES OF FUTURE CARE HE MAKES HIS CLAIM SIMPLY ON HOLY WRIT AND ON THE FEELING OF DUTY WHICH
THOUGH HE COMPLAINS IN MARCH WE MOVE DOWN SOUTH FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS DO COME IF YOU CAN MOST SINCERELY YOURS LAURA KENNEDY
EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
THE REAL EVILS INDEED OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO WELL OF HERSELF
AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING WITH WHAT SELF DENYING GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND PROMOTED THE MATCH BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER
AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE
THROUGH AT HARTFIELD BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND
THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER
AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND
THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON
AND HE HAD ONLY HIS OWN COMFORT TO SEEK AND HIS OWN SITUATION TO IMPROVE AS HE COULD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE BECAME DESIRABLE HE QUITTED THE MILITIA AND ENGAGED IN TRADE
HER SITUATION WAS ALTOGETHER THE SUBJECT OF HOURS OF GRATITUDE TO MISSUS WESTON AND OF MOMENTS ONLY OF REGRET AND HER SATISFACTION HER MORE THAN SATISFACTION HER CHEERFUL ENJOYMENT WAS SO JUST
TAYLOR WHEN THEY LEFT HER AT RANDALLS IN THE CENTRE OF EVERY DOMESTIC COMFORT OR SAW HER GO AWAY IN THE EVENING ATTENDED BY HER PLEASANT HUSBAND TO A CARRIAGE OF HER OWN
THERE WAS NO RECOVERING MISS TAYLOR NOR MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF CEASING TO PITY HER BUT A FEW WEEKS BROUGHT SOME ALLEVIATION TO MISTER WOODHOUSE THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS WERE OVER
AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU
I AM GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY MONEY TO HELP THOSE WOMEN TO A BETTER LIFE VIRGINIA LOOKED OVER TO THE END OF THE HALL WHERE THE DAY BEFORE LOREEN'S BODY HAD LAIN I HAVE DECIDED ON A GOOD PLAN AS IT SEEMS TO ME
AND I DO NOT WANT TO BE SIMPLY A DISPENSER OF THIS MONEY GOD HELP ME I DO WANT TO PUT MYSELF INTO THE PROBLEM BUT YOU KNOW RACHEL I HAVE A FEELING ALL THE TIME THAT ALL THAT LIMITLESS MONEY AND LIMITLESS PERSONAL SACRIFICE CAN POSSIBLY DO
IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD DREAMED OF DOING HERSELF IT REPRESENTED TO HER SOMETHING THAT SHE FELT WAS IN KEEPING WITH A RIGHT USE OF HER TALENT YES SHE SAID AS SHE ROSE AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT VIRGINIA
WHILE BOTH GIRLS IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM PACED THE HALL YES I WILL GLADLY PUT MY LIFE INTO THAT KIND OF SERVICE I DO BELIEVE THAT JESUS WOULD HAVE ME USE MY LIFE IN THIS WAY VIRGINIA WHAT MIRACLES CAN WE NOT ACCOMPLISH IN HUMANITY
BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER REALLY LIKED JASPER CHASE HE IS TOO COLD AND I DO NOT LIKE TO JUDGE HIM BUT I HAVE ALWAYS DISTRUSTED HIS SINCERITY IN TAKING THE PLEDGE AT THE CHURCH WITH THE REST
DID YOU EVER KNOW OF A GIRL OF SUCH REALLY GIFTED POWERS IN VOCAL MUSIC WHO WAS WILLING TO GIVE HER LIFE TO THE PEOPLE AS RACHEL IS GOING TO DO SHE IS GOING TO GIVE MUSIC LESSONS IN THE CITY HAVE PRIVATE PUPILS TO MAKE HER LIVING
NEITHER CAN I IMAGINE MISS HE SPOKE THE NAME OF THE GIRL WITH THE RED PARASOL WHO HAD BEGGED VIRGINIA TO TAKE THE GIRLS TO THE RECTANGLE DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING VIRGINIA ANY MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE MISTER
HE HAD COME SUDDENLY UPON HER AS HE TURNED INTO THE AVENUE AND HIS HEART HAD LEAPED UP AT THE SIGHT OF HER HE WALKED ALONG BY HER NOW REJOICING AFTER ALL IN A LITTLE MOMENT OF THIS EARTHLY LOVE HE COULD NOT DRIVE OUT OF HIS LIFE I HAVE JUST BEEN OVER TO SEE VIRGINIA
WE LOOKED OVER A GOOD MANY IT IS ASTONISHING TO ME WHERE VIRGINIA HAS MANAGED TO GET ALL HER IDEAS ABOUT THIS WORK VIRGINIA KNOWS MORE NOW ABOUT ARNOLD TOYNBEE AND EAST END LONDON AND INSTITUTIONAL CHURCH WORK IN AMERICA
ANOTHER THING I HAVE ACTUALLY INTERESTED SOME OF THEM IN THE RECTANGLE WORK AND WHEN IT IS STARTED UP THEY WILL GIVE SOMETHING TO HELP MAKE IT MORE POWERFUL AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS FROM GOING TO THE BAD IN GAMBLING
RACHEL COULD NOT HELP SEEING IT THEY WALKED ALONG IN SILENCE AT LAST ROLLIN SAID I THANK YOU IT HAS BEEN WORTH MORE TO ME THAN I CAN TELL YOU TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT HE LOOKED INTO HER FACE FOR ONE MOMENT
HE SICKENED AT THE SIGHT HE FOUND HIMSELF ASKING HOW MUCH CLEANSING COULD A MILLION DOLLARS POURED INTO THIS CESSPOOL ACCOMPLISH
HENRY MAXWELL STANDING AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE MOVEMENT WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE OF ITS POWER AS SOME ONE FROM THE OUTSIDE MIGHT HAVE DONE BUT RAYMOND ITSELF FELT THE TOUCH IN VERY MANY WAYS NOT KNOWING ALL THE REASONS FOR THE CHANGE
THIN YOUNG MAN WHOSE EXPRESSION WAS ONE OF HABITUAL ANXIETY HABITUAL WARINESS AND HABITUAL EAGERNESS HE PROPELLED A PERAMBULATOR CONTAINING THE THIRD
WELL MAYBE IF YOU KEEP ON THE WAY YOU BEEN
MARY HAPPENING TO GLANCE FROM A WINDOW SAW BIBBS COMING AND SHE STARTED CLASPING HER HANDS TOGETHER IN A SUDDEN ALARM
I'VE HAD NOTHING BUT DREAMS BIBBS SAID DESOLATELY BUT THEY WEREN'T LIKE THAT SIBYL SAID NO GIRL COULD CARE ABOUT ME HE SMILED FAINTLY
TO DAY MARY DREW A DEEP BREATH I THINK I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE SHE BIT HER LIP THERE WAS ANGER IN GOOD TRUTH IN HER EYES AND IN HER VOICE
YOU TOOK YOUR FATHER'S OFFER AND THEN CAME TO ASK ME TO MARRY YOU WHAT HAD I SHOWN YOU OF MYSELF THAT COULD MAKE YOU SUDDENLY SHE SANK DOWN KNEELING WITH HER FACE BURIED IN HER ARMS UPON THE LAP OF A CHAIR
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO TELL ME SHE SAID YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PUT IT INTO WORDS THEY ARE TOO HUMILIATING FOR ME AND YOU'RE TOO GENTLE TO SAY THEM TELL ME THOUGH ISN'T IT TRUE
YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT I'D TRIED TO MAKE YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ME NEVER NEVER FOR AN INSTANT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE I'D TRIED TO MAKE YOU WANT TO MARRY ME NO NO NO I BELIEVE IT BIBBS
I DID TRY TO MAKE JIM WANT TO MARRY ME I DID AND SHE SANK DOWN INTO THE CHAIR WEEPING BITTERLY AGAIN BIBBS WAS AGONIZED MARY HE GROANED
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD CRY LISTEN SHE SAID LISTEN TILL I GET THROUGH I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WE WERE POOR AND WE WEREN'T FITTED TO BE WE NEVER HAD BEEN AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
I WENT OUT TO BE FASCINATING AND BE MARRIED I DID IT OPENLY AT LEAST AND WITH A KIND OF DECENT HONESTY I TOLD YOUR BROTHER I HAD MEANT TO FASCINATE HIM
BUT I THINK THAT THOUGH I DID MEAN TO MARRY HIM I NEVER SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BECAUSE THAT SORT OF A MARRIAGE IS IT'S SACRILEGE SOMETHING WOULD HAVE STOPPED ME
WON'T YOU HE STAMMERED MARY I'M GOING WITH FATHER ISN'T THERE SOME WAY YOU COULD USE THE MONEY WITHOUT WITHOUT SHE GAVE A CHOKED LITTLE LAUGH YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR HE SAID YOU KEPT ME ALIVE I THINK
AS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS CITY SAID MISTER NEWBERRY LEANING BACK IN A LEATHER ARMCHAIR AT THE MAUSOLEUM CLUB AND LIGHTING A SECOND CIGAR IT'S ROTTEN THAT'S ALL
AND THEN LEANING FORWARDS IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKING CAREFULLY ABOUT THE CORRIDORS OF THE CLUB HE SPOKE BEHIND HIS HAND AND SAID AND THE MAYOR'S THE BIGGEST GRAFTER OF THE LOT AND WHAT'S MORE HE ADDED
THEY HAD BEEN SITTING IN A QUIET CORNER OF THE CLUB IT WAS ON A SUNDAY EVENING
WHEN MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER DICK OVEREND WERE YOUNG MEN WENT INTO CONGRESS FROM PURE PATRIOTISM THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS GRAFT OR CROOKEDNESS AS THEY BOTH ADMITTED IN THOSE DAYS AND AS FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE
AND THEN SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND TOOK LONG DRINKS OF WHISKEY AND SODA THEN NATURALLY SPEAKING OF THE ROTTENNESS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD LED THEM TO TALK OF THE ROTTENNESS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE
AS FOR THE PRESENT LEGISLATURE WELL MISTER NEWBERRY HAD HAD HE SAID OCCASION TO VISIT THE STATE CAPITAL A WEEK BEFORE IN CONNECTION WITH A RAILWAY BILL THAT HE WAS TRYING TO THAT IS THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO
WAS THAT THEY HAD LIVED AND DONE BUSINESS UNDER THIS INFERNAL CORRUPTION FOR THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AND HADN'T NOTICED IT THEY HAD BEEN TOO BUSY THE FACT WAS THAT THEIR CONVERSATION REFLECTED NOT SO MUCH THEIR OWN ORIGINAL IDEAS
HOW AND WHERE THIS MOVEMENT OF INDIGNATION HAD STARTED PEOPLE SAID THAT IT WAS PART OF A NEW WAVE OF PUBLIC MORALITY THAT WAS SWEEPING OVER THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES CERTAINLY IT WAS BEING REMARKED IN ALMOST EVERY SECTION OF THE COUNTRY
CHICAGO NEWSPAPERS WERE ATTRIBUTING ITS ORIGIN TO THE NEW VIGOUR AND THE FRESH IDEALS OF THE MIDDLE WEST IN BOSTON IT WAS SAID TO BE DUE TO A REVIVAL OF THE GRAND OLD NEW ENGLAND SPIRIT IN PHILADELPHIA
AS A PROTEST AGAINST THE SLUGGISHNESS AND IGNORANCE OF THE SOUTH IN THE WEST THEY SPOKE OF IT AS A REVOLT AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE EAST AND IN THE EAST THEY CALLED IT A REACTION AGAINST THE LAWLESSNESS OF THE WEST BUT EVERYWHERE THEY HAILED IT AS A NEW SIGN OF THE GLORIOUS
UNITY OF THE COUNTRY IF THEREFORE MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER OVEREND WERE FOUND TO BE DISCUSSING THE CORRUPT STATE OF THEIR CITY THEY ONLY SHARED IN THE NATIONAL SENTIMENTS OF THE MOMENT IN FACT IN THE SAME CITY HUNDREDS OF OTHER CITIZENS
INGRATIATING TONE THERE IS NO MORE PITIABLE SPECTACLE THAN AN HONEST MAN CAUGHT IN THE ACT OF SPEAKING BOLDLY AND FEARLESSLY OF THE EVIL DOER GOOD EVENING MISTER MAYOR ECHOED MISTER DICK OVEREND ALSO RUBBING HIS HANDS
NOT SO MISS CARLYLE ALL WHO HAD APPROACHED HER WITH THE LOVELORN TALE SHE SENT QUICKLY TO THE RIGHT ABOUT MISTER CARLYLE WAS SEATED IN HIS OWN PRIVATE ROOM IN HIS OFFICE THE MORNING AFTER HIS RETURN FROM TOWN HIS CONFIDENTIAL CLERK AND MANAGER STOOD NEAR HIM
PRESENTLY MISS BARBARA HE IS ENGAGED JUST NOW THE JUSTICES ARE WITH HIM THE JUSTICES UTTERED BARBARA IN ALARM AND PAPA ONE WHATEVER SHALL I DO HE MUST NOT SEE ME I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM SEE ME HERE FOR THE WORLD AN OMINOUS SOUND OF TALKING
THIS ROOM IS SACRED FROM THE INTRUSION OF STRANGERS WHAT OF RICHARD HE SAYS THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE COTTAGE AT THE TIME THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED THAT THE PERSON WHO REALLY DID IT WAS A MAN OF THE NAME OF THORN WHAT THORN ASKED MISTER CARLYLE
A COURTESY PROBABLY NOT YET SHOWN TO ANY CLIENT BY MISTER CARLYLE THE HOUSE DOOR CLOSED UPON HER AND BARBARA HAD TAKEN ONE STEP FROM IT WHEN SOMETHING LARGE LOOMED DOWN UPON HER LIKE A SHIP IN FULL SAIL
IT IS NOTHING THAT COULD INTEREST YOU A TRIFLING MATTER RELATING TO A LITTLE MONEY IT'S NOTHING INDEED THEN IF IT'S NOTHING WHY WERE YOU CLOSETED SO LONG WITH ARCHIBALD HE WAS ASKING THE PARTICULARS REPLIED BARBARA RECOVERING HER EQUANIMITY
WHEN DISSENTING FROM A PROBLEM SHE WAS SURE THERE WAS SOME MYSTERY ASTIR SHE TURNED AND WALKED DOWN THE STREET WITH BARBARA
MISTER CARLYLE RETURNED TO HIS ROOM DELIBERATED A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN RANG HIS BELL A CLERK ANSWERED IT GO TO THE BUCK'S HEAD IF MISTER HARE AND THE OTHER MAGISTRATES ARE THERE ASK THEM TO STEP OVER TO ME THE YOUNG MAN DID AS HE WAS BID
AND HE TOOK HIS COURSE TO TELL HER THE TRUTH SHE WAS TO BORROW THE WORDS BARBARA HAD USED TO HER BROTHER WITH REGARD TO HIM TRUE AS STEEL CONFIDE TO MISS CARLYLE A SECRET AND SHE WAS TRUSTWORTHY AND IMPERVIOUS AS HE COULD BE
TURN HIMSELF UP AT WEST LYNNE FOR BEARDING MISTER CARLYLE WHAT HAVE HE DONE WITH LADY ISABEL HIM PUT UP FOR OTHERS AT WEST LYNNE WEST LYNNE'S RESPECTABLE IT DON'T WANT HIM IT HAVE GOT A BETTER MAN IT WON'T HAVE A VILLAIN NOW LADS
NOT TO SPEAK OF THE TAGRAG'S HELP WHO WENT IN WITH CUFFS AND KICKS AND POKES AND TAUNTS AND CHEERS AND A DEMONIAC DANCE THEY DRAGGED HIM THROUGH A GAP IN THE HEDGE A GAP THAT NO BABY COULD HAVE GOT THROUGH IN A COOL MOMENT BUT MOST OF US KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COOLNESS AND EXCITEMENT
MISS CARLYLE STOOD HER GROUND MAJESTICALLY AND LOOKED ON WITH A GRIM COUNTENANCE HAD SHE INTERFERED FOR HIS PROTECTION SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HEARD AND IF SHE COULD HAVE BEEN THERE'S NO KNOWING WHETHER SHE WOULD HAVE DONE IT ON TO THE BRINK OF THE POND
HIS SHIVERY LIMBS AND HIS DILAPIDATED GARMENTS SHAKING THE WET OFF HIM THE LABORERS THEIR DUTY DONE WALKED COOLLY AWAY THE TAGRAG WITHDREW TO A SAFE DISTANCE WAITING FOR WHAT MIGHT COME NEXT AND MISS CARLYLE MOVED AWAY ALSO
WITH TORTOISE SHELL RIMS LEFT BY SOME STRANGER AGES AND AGES AGO TO BE MENDED AND NEVER CALLED FOR AGAIN THIS VERY PAIR OF UGLY OLD GREEN THINGS WAS CHOSEN BY LADY ISABEL SHE PUT THEM ON THERE AND THEN
MISS CORNY FLEW TO THE WINDOW LADY ISABEL IN HER WAKE TWO CROWDS IT MAY ALMOST BE SAID FOR FROM THE OPPOSITE WAY THE SCARLET AND PURPLE PARTY AS MISTER CARLYLE'S WAS CALLED IN ALLUSION TO HIS COLORS CAME IN VIEW
STUCK HIS PENDENT EYE GLASSES ASTRIDE ON THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE SIR FRANCIS LEVISON COULD IT BE YES IT ACTUALLY WAS WHAT ON EARTH HAD PUT HIM INTO THAT STATE
MISS CARLYLE LAID HER HAND UPON THE SHRINKING ARM OF HER PALE COMPANION YOU SEE HIM MY BROTHER ARCHIBALD I SEE HIM FALTERED LADY ISABEL AND YOU SEE HIM THAT PITIFUL OUTCAST WHO IS TOO CONTEMPTIBLE TO LIVE
I NEVER SAW A CHAP SO EXCITED PETER CRIED CRIED ECHOED MISS CARLYLE WELL MA'AM YOU KNOW HE WAS VERY FOND OF LADY ISABEL WAS PETER AND SOMEHOW HIS FEELINGS OVERCAME HIM HE SAID HE HAD NOT HEARD ANYTHING TO PLEASE HIM SO MUCH FOR MANY A DAY
AND WITH THAT HE BURST OUT CRYING AND GAVE BILL WHITE HALF A CROWN OUT OF HIS POCKET
WHICH HE COULD JUST RECOLLECT HAVING VISITED DURING A VOYAGE MADE IN HIS EARLIEST YOUTH
ASKED THE ABBE OH YOUR GREAT WORK ON THE MONARCHY OF ITALY
I TOLD YOU HOW I MANAGED TO OBTAIN THAT AND I ONLY JUST MAKE IT FROM TIME TO TIME AS I REQUIRE IT ONE THING STILL PUZZLES ME OBSERVED DANTES AND THAT IS HOW YOU MANAGED TO DO ALL THIS BY DAYLIGHT
NIGHT WHY FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE ARE YOUR EYES LIKE CATS THAT YOU CAN SEE TO WORK IN THE DARK INDEED THEY ARE NOT BUT GOD HAS SUPPLIED MAN WITH THE INTELLIGENCE THAT ENABLES HIM TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF NATURAL CONDITIONS
WHO SUPPLIED YOU WITH THE MATERIALS FOR MAKING THIS WONDERFUL WORK I TORE UP SEVERAL OF MY SHIRTS AND RIPPED OUT THE SEAMS IN THE SHEETS OF MY BED DURING MY THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT AT FENESTRELLE
I ONCE THOUGHT CONTINUED FARIA OF REMOVING THESE IRON BARS AND LETTING MYSELF DOWN FROM THE WINDOW WHICH AS YOU SEE IS SOMEWHAT WIDER THAN YOURS ALTHOUGH I SHOULD HAVE ENLARGED IT STILL MORE PREPARATORY TO MY FLIGHT
THAT A PERSON SO INTELLIGENT INGENIOUS AND CLEAR SIGHTED AS THE ABBE MIGHT PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE DARK MYSTERY OF HIS OWN MISFORTUNES WHERE HE HIMSELF COULD SEE NOTHING
AS YET BUT ONE OF THEM LET ME HEAR THE OTHER IT WAS THIS THAT WHILE YOU HAD RELATED TO ME ALL THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR PAST LIFE YOU WERE PERFECTLY UNACQUAINTED WITH MINE YOUR LIFE MY YOUNG FRIEND HAS NOT BEEN OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH
MY FATHER AND MERCEDES COME SAID THE ABBE CLOSING HIS HIDING PLACE AND PUSHING THE BED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL SITUATION LET ME HEAR YOUR STORY DANTES OBEYED AND COMMENCED WHAT HE CALLED HIS HISTORY
HIS ARREST AND SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION HIS TEMPORARY DETENTION AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE AND HIS FINAL IMPRISONMENT IN THE CHATEAU D'IF FROM THIS POINT EVERYTHING WAS A BLANK TO DANTES HE KNEW NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED
AND EVEN OF THAT IF HARD PRESSED WOULD HAVE YIELDED THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN EXTREMITIES BUT IN THE CENTRAL PART OF ENGLAND THERE WAS SURELY SOME SECURITY FOR THE EXISTENCE EVEN OF A WIFE NOT BELOVED IN THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND THE MANNERS OF THE AGE
THERE SUCH AS WERE NOT AS SPOTLESS AS AN ANGEL MIGHT HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF A FIEND BUT IN ENGLAND IT WAS NOT SO AMONG THE ENGLISH SHE BELIEVED IN THEIR HEARTS AND HABITS
UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF EVEN IN HENRY AND ELEANOR TILNEY SOME SLIGHT IMPERFECTION MIGHT HEREAFTER APPEAR
AND UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE NEED NOT FEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME ACTUAL SPECKS IN THE CHARACTER OF THEIR FATHER WHO THOUGH CLEARED FROM THE GROSSLY INJURIOUS SUSPICIONS WHICH SHE MUST EVER BLUSH TO HAVE ENTERTAINED SHE DID BELIEVE
AND CAPABLE AS HERETOFORE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT BY ANYTHING HE SAID THERE WERE STILL SOME SUBJECTS INDEED UNDER WHICH SHE BELIEVED THEY MUST ALWAYS TREMBLE THE MENTION OF A CHEST OR A CABINET FOR INSTANCE
HER ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA JAMES HAD PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD AND MISSUS ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO FULLERTON
THOUGH GOD KNOWS WITH LITTLE INCLINATION FOR WRITING I THINK IT MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS AT AN END BETWEEN MISS THORPE AND ME I LEFT HER AND BATH YESTERDAY NEVER TO SEE EITHER AGAIN
TILL THE VERY LAST IF I REASONED WITH HER SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER
DEAREST CATHERINE BEWARE HOW YOU GIVE YOUR HEART
AND SHORT EXCLAMATIONS OF SORROWING WONDER DECLARED HER TO BE RECEIVING UNPLEASANT NEWS AND HENRY EARNESTLY WATCHING HER THROUGH THE WHOLE LETTER SAW PLAINLY THAT IT ENDED NO BETTER THAN IT BEGAN HE WAS PREVENTED HOWEVER
SUCH A FRIEND AS ISABELLA HAD BEEN TO HER AND THEN THEIR OWN BROTHER SO CLOSELY CONCERNED IN IT SHE BELIEVED SHE MUST WAIVE THE SUBJECT ALTOGETHER HENRY AND ELEANOR WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND EACH AS SHE ENTERED IT
IT CONTAINED SOMETHING WORSE THAN ANYBODY COULD SUPPOSE POOR JAMES IS SO UNHAPPY YOU WILL SOON KNOW WHY TO HAVE SO KIND HEARTED SO AFFECTIONATE A SISTER REPLIED HENRY WARMLY MUST BE A COMFORT TO HIM UNDER ANY DISTRESS
ARTLESS GUILELESS WITH AFFECTIONS STRONG BUT SIMPLE FORMING NO PRETENSIONS AND KNOWING NO DISGUISE SUCH A SISTER IN LAW HENRY I SHOULD DELIGHT IN SAID ELEANOR WITH A SMILE
YOU THINK IT IS ALL FOR AMBITION THEN AND UPON MY WORD THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT SEEM VERY LIKE IT I CANNOT FORGET THAT WHEN SHE FIRST KNEW WHAT MY FATHER WOULD DO FOR THEM SHE SEEMED QUITE DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT MORE
I SUPPOSE HE WILL HARDLY EVER RECOVER IT YOUR BROTHER IS CERTAINLY VERY MUCH TO BE PITIED AT PRESENT BUT WE MUST NOT IN OUR CONCERN FOR HIS SUFFERINGS UNDERVALUE YOURS YOU FEEL I SUPPOSE THAT IN LOSING ISABELLA
CHAPTER SEVEN THE TIMELY RESCUE IT WAS NO PLEASANT THOUGHT TO CONTEMPLATE THE PRESENCE OF A BOLD
WAS SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT JERRY AND SLIM FROM TAKING A FULL EIGHT HOURS OF MUCH NEEDED SLEEP WHILE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON JOE AND THREE OTHER OFFICERS WHOM THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN INTO HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE MATTER FOLLOWED OUT EVERY POSSIBLE CLUE IN PURSUIT OF A SOLUTION OF THE BAFFLING MYSTERY
BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM WITHIN
TWO MORE ATTEMPTS AND THE PANEL FELL IN STRIPS TO THE FLOOR THUS GIVEN SOMETHING FOR A GRIP HOLD THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS A MASSIVE MAN TOOK HOLD WITH BOTH HANDS
AND SO EVEN AS TWO MEN CARRIED LIEUTENANT MACKINSON AWAY HE REMAINED STANDING AT SALUTE WAITING FOR THE CAPTAIN TO RECOGNIZE HIM WITH A RETURN OF THE SALUTE AND NOW WHAT ASKED THE CAPTAIN JERRY STEPPED FORWARD WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING HIS EXCITEMENT
WHEN I RETURNED I FOUND THIS LYING UPON THE TABLE HE OPENED HIS LEFT HAND IN IT LAY A PIECE OF LIGHT CHAIN BOTH ENDS BROKEN BESIDE IT HE CONTINUED WAS THIS NOTE FROM HIS POCKET HE EXTRACTED A PIECE OF PAPER THE EDGES OF WHICH WERE ROUGHLY TORN
IS SHOVED INTO A CLOSET AND ONLY ESCAPES DEATH FROM SUFFOCATION BY MAKING HIMSELF HEARD AS HE TELEGRAPHS FOR HELP OVER A STEAM PIPE IT MUST HAVE BEEN WHILE WE WERE RESCUING THE LIEUTENANT THAT THE SAME MAN AGAIN ENTERS THE WIRELESS ROOM AND LEAVES THERE THIS CHAIN
THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT IT SEEMED HAD BEEN FOLLOWING A TRAIL WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS LEADING HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE OBJECT OF THE HUNT AND IT WAS IN FORGING THE LINKS OF THIS CHAIN OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE YOUNG OFFICER WAS LED INTO THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE SHIP
EVIDENTLY ALSO FROM THE BOILER OR ENGINE ROOM BRUSHED BY US HE HAD DISAPPEARED WHEN THE SAILOR SAID TO ME I THINK THAT WAS THE FELLOW THE ONE THAT JUST WENT BY NOT WANTING TO AROUSE HIS SUSPICIONS I ENDED THE CONVERSATION WITH A CASUAL REMARK AND THEN STROLLED AWAY UNTIL I WAS OUT OF THE SAILOR'S SIGHT
WELL WHAT'S YOUR SUGGESTION SLIM DEMANDED THAT WE DIVIDE OUR FORCES ANSWERED JOE SOLEMNLY LIE IN WAIT AND TRY TO AMBUSH THE FOE RIGHT CRIED JERRY JOE YOU'LL BE A GENERAL BEFORE THIS WAR'S OVER
WON'T DO IT SLIM MUTTERED OH YES YOU WILL COUNSELED JOE SHAKE HANDS THE TWO OF YOU SLIM'S GOOD NATURE OVERCAME HIS FEIGNED RELUCTANCE BUT AS JERRY GRASPED HIS HAND HE GAVE JERRY A JERK THAT NEARLY TOOK HIM OFF HIS FEET NOW WE'RE SQUARE SAID SLIM
I'M WILLING SAID JERRY BUT YOU AND I WILL HAVE TO DO THE OUTSIDE WORK
THE FIRST ASSISTANT ENGINEER WAS A MIGHTY MOUNTAIN OF A MAN BUT HIS VOICE BROKE OFF AS THE COMMOTION STARTED AGAIN CERTAINLY HE MUST HAVE A ROUGH CUSTOMER TO DEAL WITH THOUGHT JERRY
YE WILL WILL YE HISSED THE VOICE OF THE ENGINEER AGAIN
AND WHIN I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE'D CAUGHT THE MAN THE DOCTOR WHISPERED
HIS THREE ASSISTANTS ON THE TRIP ACROSS WERE THE FIRST ONES NAMED THE OTHER TWO WERE TOM RAWLE A FELLOW PROPORTIONED LIKE THEIR FIRST FRIEND IN THE SERVICE SERGEANT MARTIN AND A WIRY ENERGETIC QUICK SPEAKING YOUTH NAMED FRANK HOSKINS
GOT HERE TWO WEEKS AGO THE BIG FELLOW ANSWERED
AND IT WAS A SURPRISE PARTY FOR FAIR I CAN TELL YOU
WHERE IN THAT COUNTRY THEY HAD SEEN BIG CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND
BY THIS TIME THEY WERE WELL WITHIN SOUND OF THE HEAVY GUNS AND THEIR DRIVER TOLD THEM THAT THE ARTILLERY DUEL THEN GOING ON HAD BEEN IN PROGRESS FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS AT LEAST
THAT WAS POUNDING AWAY AT THE ENEMY IN TERRIBLE DETONATIONS THAT SHOOK AND ROCKED THE GROUND EVERY MINUTE AT THE SECOND LINE TRENCHES THEIR ORDERS CALLED FOR A HALT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE TOLD THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DOING
WAS A CONSTANTLY MOVING LINE OF MOTOR TRUCKS COMING FORWARD WITH MEN AND SHELLS WHILE OUT AHEAD OF THEM TREMENDOUS AND MENACING BIG TANKS
AND AFTER DARK TO NIGHT WE ARE TO ESTABLISH AN OUTLYING COMMUNICATION FROM THE FARTHEST SKIRMISH POINTS TO HEADQUARTERS ALMOST AS HE FINISHED THE SENTENCE THEY WERE STARTED
AND PROMPTLY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THEY STARTED UPON THE DANGEROUS MISSION WITH NIGHTFALL THE BIG CANNONADING HAD NOTICEABLY SHUT DOWN
IT WAS A BLACK NIGHT AND THEY PROCEEDED WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION THEY DID NOT DARE USE THE FLASHLIGHTS THAT EACH OF THEM CARRIED AND FREQUENTLY ALL OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO DROP SUDDENLY FLAT UPON THE GROUND AS A BIG ROCKET WENT UP FROM EITHER SIDE
WHILE TOM RAWLE QUIETLY CHUCKLING AT THE FAT LAD'S MISFORTUNE AIDED HIM TO HIS FEET DOWN FLAT SAID MACKINSON AGAIN AS HE DISCERNED SEVERAL SHADOWS MOVING ACROSS A SPACE A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE TO THE NORTH OF THEM
FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH AVIATORS HAD BEEN REPORTING HEAVY GERMAN FORMATIONS IN THAT REGION EVIDENTLY WITH THE DESIGN OF A TERRIFIC ASSAULT BUT THE ALLIED COMMANDERS HAD NOT EXPECTED IT SO SOON AND IN TRUTH THEY WERE NOT FULLY PREPARED FOR IT
INCLUDING FOOD AND AMMUNITION TRAINS
A STATIONARY BALLOON SHOWED WHERE JERRY AND AN OBSERVATION OFFICER WERE DOING DUTY ON THAT FATEFUL DAY JERRY WAS OPERATING A TELEPHONE THAT RAN DIRECTLY TO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS AND HARDLY A MOMENT PASSED WHEN HE WAS NOT REPEATING SOME OBSERVATION OF THE OTHER MAN IN THE BASKET WITH HIM
WHERE THEY WERE DRAWING UP THEIR HEAVIEST FORCES OF RESERVES WHAT QUICK CHANGES WERE BEING MADE IN THEIR GENERAL LINE OF FORMATION AND HOW FAR BACK THEIR FORCES SEEMED TO EXTEND SLIM GOODWIN
SO YOU CAN JUDGE PRETTY WELL FOR YOURSELF GUESS HE HAD A PRETTY GOOD BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE WHOLE THING SAID JOE AS THEY PASSED ON TO MEET AGAIN BEFORE MESS EXCEPT FOR SPASMODIC OUTBURSTS HERE AND THERE THE TRENCH DUEL HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY SUBSIDED
IT SIMPLY INDICATED THAT THOSE MANNING THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH ANTI AIRCRAFT GUNS
THE AMERICAN PLANES MANEUVERED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO ENCIRCLE THE TAUBE
AS THE TAUBE CAME WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE GROUND AND RIGHTED HERSELF FOR A LANDING
OPENING THEM THE BOYS COULD HARDLY SUPPRESS THEIR JUBILATION STRIPPED OF THEIR OFFICIAL VERBIAGE THE LETTERS INFORMED THE YOUNG MEN THAT EACH OF THEM WAS MADE A CORPORAL JOE FOR VALOROUS SERVICE IN SAVING THE LIVES OF THREE AMERICANS ENTOMBED IN A CAVE
FOR THE RED CROSS AND KINDRED ACTIVITIES BUT ALTHOUGH THE WAR WAS IN THE NATION'S MIND IT WAS NOT YET IN ITS SOUL LIFE WENT ON MUCH AS BEFORE AN ABIDING FAITH IN THE ALLIES WAS THE FOUNDATION STONE OF ITS COMPLACENCY
WAS THE BEAUTY OF YOUTH ONLY AND THAT THAT WAS GOING LATE HOURS GOLF PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE CHAMPAGNE THAN WAS NECESSARY AT DINNERS AND THE MORNINGS FOUND HER ALMOST PLAIN AND TOO
THEY BROUGHT OR SENT HER TRIBUTE FLOWERS CANDY AND CIGARETS

AND SHE HAD HELPED HIM OUT OF A HOLE JUST NOW ALL RIGHT I PROMISE HE SAID AT LAST BUT YOU'RE WORRYING YOURSELF FOR NOTHING MOTHER SHE WAS QUITE CONTENT THEN CHEERED AT ONCE CONSULTED THE JEWELLED WATCH ON HER DRESSING TABLE
AND SO ON THROUGH A VARIETY OF WAYS AND WINDING LANES TILL THEY ARRIVED AT AN OPEN PORTION OF THE TOWN A DISTRICT WHERE STREETS AND SQUARES AND EVEN ROWS DISAPPEARED AND WHERE THE TALL CHIMNEYS AND BULKY BARRACK LOOKING BUILDINGS
THAT ROSE IN ALL DIRECTIONS CLUSTERING YET ISOLATED ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE IN THE PRINCIPAL SCENE OF THE INDUSTRY OF MOWBRAY CROSSING THIS OPEN GROUND THEY GAINED A SUBURB BUT ONE OF A VERY DIFFERENT DESCRIPTION
BY NARROW ARCHWAYS LIKE THE ENTRANCE OF HIVES SO LOW THAT YOU WERE OBLIGED TO STOOP FOR ADMISSION WHILE ASCENDING TO THESE SAME STREETS FROM THEIR DANK AND DISMAL DWELLINGS BY NARROW FLIGHTS OF STEPS
STILL OFFERED MANY TEMPTATIONS TO MANY WHO COULD NOT PURCHASE AND SO IT IS WIDOW SAID A LITTLE PALE MAN WISTFULLY COME COME IT'S GETTING LATE AND YOUR WIFE'S ILL YOU'RE A GOOD SOUL
OR THE MAYOR OF MOWBRAY AT LEAST WAGES SAID THE MAN I WISH YOU MAY GET EM THOSE VILLAINS SHUFFLE AND SCREW HAVE SARVED ME WITH ANOTHER BATE TICKET AND A PRETTY FIGURE TOO

AND IF YOU LIKE TO TAKE THIS SCRAG END HOME TO YOUR WIFE NEIGHBOUR HILL WE CAN TALK OF THE REST NEXT SATURDAY AND WHAT'S YOUR WILL SIR SAID THE WIDOW WITH A STERN EXPRESSION TO A YOUTH WHO NOW STOPPED AT HER STALL
WHAT MAKES HER DRINK BUT TOIL WORKING FROM FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO SEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND FOR THE LIKE OF SUCH AS YOU THAT'S A GOOD ONE SAID THE YOUTH I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MY MOTHER EVER DID FOR ME BUT GIVE ME TREACLE AND LAUDANUM WHEN I WAS A BABBY
IT'S VERY WELL KNOWN THAT I'M A MAN WHAT PAYS HIS WAY SAID THE BOY AND DON'T KEEP A HUCKSTER'S STALL TO SELL CARRION BY STAR LIGHT BUT LIVE IN A TWO PAIR IF YOU PLEASE AND HAS A WIFE AND FAMILY OR AS GOOD
AND THEN I'M NO SCHOLAR SAID THE GIRL AND NEVER COULD TAKE TO LEARNING AND THOSE TRAFFORDS HAD SO MANY SCHOOLS LEARNING IS BETTER THAN HOUSE AND LAND SAID MISSUS CAREY THOUGH I'M NO SCHOLAR MYSELF BUT THEN IN MY TIME THINGS WAS DIFFERENT

AND WE SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE YOU MICK AND JULIA IF YOU ARE NOT ENGAGED CONTINUED THE GIRL AND SHE LOOKED AT HER FRIEND A PRETTY DEMURE GIRL WHO IMMEDIATELY SAID BUT IN A SOMEWHAT FAULTERING TONE OH THAT WE SHALL
WELL WE HAD NO THOUGHTS BUT I SAID TO HARRIET AS IT IS A FINE NIGHT LET US WALK ABOUT AS LONG AS WE CAN AND THEN TO MORROW WE WILL LIE IN BED TILL AFTERNOON
MORLEY PAUSED AS HE RECOGNISED EGREMONT THEN ADVANCING TO GERARD FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANION HE SAID THIS IS MISTER HATTON OF WHOM WE WERE SPEAKING LAST NIGHT AND WHO CLAIMS TO BE AN ANCIENT ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS
PERHAPS I SHOULD RATHER SAY OF YOUR POOR DEAR FATHER SAID HATTON SCANNING GERARD WITH HIS CLEAR BLUE EYE AND THEN HE ADDED HE WAS OF GREAT SERVICE TO ME IN MY YOUTH AND ONE IS NOT APT TO FORGET SUCH THINGS
AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SO MANY STRANGE AND HIGH HOPES AND SOME DARK BLENDING OF DOUBT AND APPREHENSION AND DISCORDANT THOUGHTS HATTON IN HIS APPEARANCE REALISED LITTLE OF THE FANCIES
YOU ARE RIGHT SAID MORLEY LOOKING AT HER RATHER KEENLY WE HAVE ALL OF US OPENED OURSELVES TOO UNRESERVEDLY BEFORE THIS ARISTOCRAT I SHOULD HOPE THAT NONE OF US HAVE SAID TO HIM A WORD THAT WE WISH TO BE FORGOTTEN SAID SYBIL
HE CHOSE TO WEAR A DISGUISE AND CAN HARDLY QUARREL WITH THE FRANKNESS WITH WHICH WE SPOKE OF HIS ORDER OR HIS FAMILY AND FOR THE REST HE HAS NOT BEEN INJURED FROM LEARNING SOMETHING OF THE FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE BY LIVING AMONG THEM
MORLEY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND THEN SAID AN EASY QUESTION QUESTIONS ARE ALWAYS EASY THE FACT IS IN ACTIVE LIFE ONE CANNOT AFFORD TO REFINE I COULD HAVE WISHED THE MOVEMENT TO HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT SHAPE
MY VISIT TO THIS CITY ALONE HAS TAUGHT ME HOW STRONG ARE OUR ENEMIES BUT I BELIEVED THAT WE HAD ON OUR SIDE GOD AND TRUTH THEY KNOW NEITHER OF THEM IN THE NATIONAL CONVENTION SAID MORLEY
SAYING IN A VOICE WHICH COULD ONLY BE HEARD BY THE INDIVIDUAL WHOM HE ADDRESSED YOU UNDERSTAND I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT MYSELF OF YOUR MORAL RIGHT I BELIEVE ON EVERY PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE THAT MOWBRAY CASTLE IS AS MUCH YOURS
HE CALLED EVERYBODY A FOOL HE THREW HIS TOOTH BRUSH AT THE PALACE CAT HE RUSHED ROUND IN HIS NIGHT SHIRT AND WOKE UP ALL HIS ARMY AND SENT THEM INTO THE JUNGLE TO CATCH THE DOCTOR
AND ENJOYED THE LIFE OF TRAVEL VERY MUCH BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS GLAD WHEN THE NIGHT CAME AND THEY STOPPED FOR THEIR RESTING TIME THEN THE DOCTOR USED TO MAKE A LITTLE FIRE OF STICKS
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE MONKEYS HAD NO HISTORY BOOKS OF THEIR OWN BEFORE DOCTOR DOLITTLE CAME TO WRITE THEM FOR THEM THEY REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS BY TELLING STORIES TO THEIR CHILDREN
BUT BEFORE THEY COULD GET INTO THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS THEY CAME TO A STEEP CLIFF WITH A RIVER FLOWING BELOW THIS WAS THE END OF THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI
THEY'VE GOT THE CAPTAIN LOOSE AND HE'S COMING ON LIKE A DEER GET LIVELY
WAS A BRIDGE ALL READY FOR HIM MADE OF LIVING MONKEYS FOR WHILE HIS BACK WAS TURNED THE MONKEYS QUICK AS A FLASH HAD MADE THEMSELVES INTO A BRIDGE
COME OUT AND LISTEN TO THE EVENING PAPER YOU INSIDE THERE CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY SO AT LAST BEGAN THE EVENING PAPER AT LA FORCE
EVERY HUMAN CREATURE HE HAD SINCE CARED FOR AND PARTED WITH HAD DIED ON THE SCAFFOLD THERE WERE HURRIED WORDS OF FAREWELL AND KINDNESS BUT THE PARTING WAS SOON OVER IT WAS THE INCIDENT OF EVERY DAY
WHEN THE COMMON ROOMS AND CORRIDORS WOULD BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE GREAT DOGS WHO KEPT WATCH THERE THROUGH THE NIGHT THE PRISONERS WERE FAR FROM INSENSIBLE OR UNFEELING THEIR WAYS AROSE OUT OF THE CONDITION OF THE TIME SIMILARLY
BUT A WILD INFECTION OF THE WILDLY SHAKEN PUBLIC MIND IN SEASONS OF PESTILENCE SOME OF US WILL HAVE A SECRET ATTRACTION TO THE DISEASE A TERRIBLE PASSING INCLINATION TO DIE OF IT
THE NIGHT IN ITS VERMIN HAUNTED CELLS WAS LONG AND COLD NEXT DAY FIFTEEN PRISONERS WERE PUT TO THE BAR BEFORE CHARLES DARNAY'S NAME WAS CALLED ALL THE FIFTEEN WERE CONDEMNED
BUT WHAT HE MOST NOTICED IN THE TWO FIGURES WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE POSTED AS CLOSE TO HIMSELF AS THEY COULD BE THEY NEVER LOOKED TOWARDS HIM THEY SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR SOMETHING WITH A DOGGED DETERMINATION
ON THESE FEW STEPS OF HIS DANGEROUS WAY CHARLES DARNAY HAD SET HIS FOOT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR MANETTE'S REITERATED INSTRUCTIONS THE SAME CAUTIOUS COUNSEL DIRECTED EVERY STEP THAT LAY BEFORE HIM
WHEREAS IN ENGLAND HE LIVED BY GIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE HE HAD RETURNED WHEN HE DID ON THE PRESSING AND WRITTEN ENTREATY OF A FRENCH CITIZEN WHO REPRESENTED THAT HIS LIFE WAS ENDANGERED BY HIS ABSENCE
NO AND THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO QUIET THEM WHICH IT DID NOT FOR THEY CONTINUED TO CRY NO
HAD BEEN A WITNESS ON THAT ENGLISH TRIAL AND COULD CORROBORATE HIS ACCOUNT OF IT THE JURY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD HEARD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY WERE READY WITH THEIR VOTES IF THE PRESIDENT WERE CONTENT TO RECEIVE THEM AT EVERY VOTE
THEN BEGAN ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WITH WHICH THE POPULACE SOMETIMES GRATIFIED THEIR FICKLENESS OR THEIR BETTER IMPULSES TOWARDS GENEROSITY AND MERCY
TO REND HIM TO PIECES AND STREW HIM OVER THE STREETS HIS REMOVAL TO MAKE WAY FOR OTHER ACCUSED PERSONS WHO WERE TO BE TRIED RESCUED HIM FROM THESE CARESSES FOR THE MOMENT
FIVE WERE TO BE TRIED TOGETHER NEXT AS ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC FORASMUCH AS THEY HAD NOT ASSISTED IT BY WORD OR DEED SO QUICK WAS THE TRIBUNAL TO COMPENSATE ITSELF AND THE NATION FOR A CHANCE LOST
SO THAT HIS TEARS AND HER LIPS MIGHT COME TOGETHER UNSEEN A FEW OF THE PEOPLE FELL TO DANCING
WHEN CATHERINE KNEW THIS HER RESOLUTION WAS DIRECTLY MADE SHE SPOKE TO HENRY TILNEY ON THE SUBJECT REGRETTING HIS BROTHER'S EVIDENT PARTIALITY FOR MISS THORPE AND ENTREATING HIM TO MAKE KNOWN HER PRIOR ENGAGEMENT
MY BROTHER DOES KNOW IT WAS HENRY'S ANSWER DOES HE THEN WHY DOES HE STAY HERE HE MADE NO REPLY AND WAS BEGINNING TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT SHE EAGERLY CONTINUED
IF HE KNOWS HER ENGAGEMENT WHAT CAN HE MEAN BY HIS BEHAVIOUR YOU ARE A VERY CLOSE QUESTIONER AM I I ONLY ASK WHAT I WANT TO BE TOLD
WELL NAY IF IT IS TO BE GUESSWORK LET US ALL GUESS FOR OURSELVES TO BE GUIDED BY SECOND HAND CONJECTURE IS PITIFUL THE PREMISES ARE BEFORE YOU
ARE YOU NOT CARRIED A LITTLE TOO FAR WOULD HE THANK YOU EITHER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT OR MISS THORPE'S FOR SUPPOSING THAT HER AFFECTION OR AT LEAST HER GOOD BEHAVIOUR IS ONLY TO BE SECURED BY HER SEEING NOTHING OF CAPTAIN TILNEY
BUT THEY'LL SUPPLY AIR FOR ONLY TWO DAYS NOW THEN WE'VE BEEN BURIED BENEATH THE WATERS FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS AND THE NAUTILUS'S HEAVY ATMOSPHERE ALREADY NEEDS RENEWING IN ANOTHER FORTY EIGHT HOURS OUR RESERVE AIR WILL BE USED UP
I'M GOING TO GROUND THE NAUTILUS ON THE LOWER SHELF THEN MY MEN WILL PUT ON THEIR DIVING SUITS AND ATTACK THE THINNEST OF THESE ICE WALLS CAN THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE BE LEFT OPEN WITHOUT ILL EFFECT WE'RE NO LONGER IN MOTION
BEFORE DIGGING INTO THE ICE THE CAPTAIN HAD TO OBTAIN BORINGS TO INSURE WORKING IN THE BEST DIRECTION LONG BORES WERE DRIVEN INTO THE SIDE WALLS BUT AFTER FIFTEEN METERS THE INSTRUMENTS WERE STILL IMPEDED BY THE THICKNESS OF THOSE WALLS
BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES COULDN'T WE ALL DIE OF ASPHYXIATION WERE THIS SHIP AND EVERYONE ON BOARD DOOMED TO PERISH IN THIS TOMB OF ICE IT WAS A DREADFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS BUT WE FACED IT HEAD ON
THERE WAS NO POINT IN DAMPENING THE ENERGY THEY WERE PUTTING INTO OUR ARDUOUS RESCUE WORK BUT WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD
THIS LIFE GIVING ELASTIC FLUID COULD HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO US I HAD THOUGHT IT ALL OUT BUT TO NO AVAIL BECAUSE THE CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCED BY OUR BREATHING PERMEATED EVERY PART OF THE SHIP TO ABSORB IT WE WOULD NEED TO FILL CONTAINERS WITH POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE
WITHOUT THIS PRECAUTION WE WOULDN'T HAVE AWAKENED THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE NEXT DAY MARCH TWENTY SIXTH I RETURNED TO MY MINER'S TRADE WORKING TO REMOVE THE FIFTH METER THE ICE BANK'S SIDE WALLS AND UNDERBELLY HAD VISIBLY THICKENED
OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD COME TOGETHER BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD BREAK FREE FOR AN INSTANT I WAS GRIPPED BY DESPAIR MY PICK NEARLY SLIPPED FROM MY HANDS WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS DIGGING IF I WAS TO DIE SMOTHERED AND CRUSHED BY THIS WATER TURNING TO STONE
THE CAPTAIN UNDERSTOOD AND GAVE ME A SIGNAL TO FOLLOW HIM WE RETURNED ON BOARD MY DIVING SUIT REMOVED I WENT WITH HIM TO THE LOUNGE PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE TOLD ME THIS CALLS FOR HEROIC MEASURES
COULD COME TO OUR RESCUE DON'T YOU SEE THAT BY SOLIDIFYING IT COULD BURST THESE TRACTS OF ICE IMPRISONING US JUST AS ITS FREEZING CAN BURST THE HARDEST STONES AREN'T YOU AWARE THAT THIS FORCE COULD BE THE INSTRUMENT OF OUR SALVATION RATHER THAN OUR DESTRUCTION
BOILING WATER I EXCLAIMED YES SIR WE'RE SHUT UP IN A RELATIVELY CONFINED AREA IF THE NAUTILUS'S PUMPS CONTINUALLY INJECTED STREAMS OF BOILING WATER INTO THIS SPACE WOULDN'T THAT RAISE ITS TEMPERATURE AND DELAY ITS FREEZING
THAT WAS ONE DEGREE GAINED
AFTER I MONITORED THE OPERATION'S PROGRESS DOUBLE CHECKING IT WITH MANY INSPECTIONS I TOLD THE CAPTAIN IT'S WORKING I THINK SO HE ANSWERED ME WE'VE ESCAPED BEING CRUSHED NOW WE HAVE ONLY ASPHYXIATION TO FEAR
I WAS FINALLY ASSURED THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF IT SOLIDIFYING BY THE NEXT DAY MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH SIX METERS OF ICE HAD BEEN TORN FROM THE SOCKET ONLY FOUR METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED THAT STILL MEANT FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF WORK
IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS RAISED FROM ITS ICY BED BY A CHANGE IN ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY WHEN IT WAS AFLOAT THE CREW TOWED IT LEADING IT RIGHT ABOVE THE IMMENSE TRENCH OUTLINED TO MATCH THE SHIP'S WATERLINE NEXT THE BALLAST TANKS FILLED WITH WATER
OUR FULL ELECTRIC POWER WAS THEN PUT ON THE PUMPS WHICH INSTANTLY BEGAN TO EXPEL WATER FROM THE BALLAST TANKS AFTER A FEW MINUTES WE HAD CHECKED OUR FALL THE PRESSURE GAUGE SOON INDICATED AN ASCENDING MOVEMENT
MY MUSCLES HAD NO POWER TO CONTRACT I'M UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE HOURS THAT PASSED IN THIS WAY BUT I WAS AWARE THAT MY DEATH THROES HAD BEGUN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE SUDDENLY I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
A FEW WHIFFS OF AIR HAD ENTERED MY LUNGS HAD WE RISEN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES HAD WE CLEARED THE ICE BANK NO NED AND CONSEIL MY TWO GALLANT FRIENDS WERE SACRIFICING THEMSELVES TO SAVE ME
INSTEAD OF BREATHING IT THEMSELVES THEY HAD SAVED IT FOR ME AND WHILE THEY WERE SUFFOCATING THEY POURED LIFE INTO ME DROP BY DROP I TRIED TO PUSH THE DEVICE AWAY THEY HELD MY HANDS AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS I COULD BREATHE LUXURIOUSLY
MY EYES FLEW TOWARD THE CLOCK IT WAS ELEVEN IN THE MORNING IT HAD TO BE MARCH TWENTY EIGHTH THE NAUTILUS WAS TRAVELING AT THE FRIGHTFUL SPEED OF FORTY MILES PER HOUR IT WAS WRITHING IN THE WATERS
CONSEIL PUT IN YES NED LAND WENT ON YOU CAN REPAY YOUR DEBT BY COMING WITH ME WHEN I LEAVE THIS INFERNAL NAUTILUS BY THE WAY CONSEIL SAID ARE WE GOING IN A FAVORABLE DIRECTION
BY THEN ALL OUR PAST SUFFERINGS WERE FORGOTTEN THE MEMORY OF THAT IMPRISONMENT UNDER THE ICE FADED FROM OUR MINDS WE HAD THOUGHTS ONLY OF THE FUTURE
ITS COASTLINE LOOKED FLAT BUT HIGH MOUNTAINS ROSE IN THE DISTANCE I EVEN THOUGHT I GLIMPSED MT SARMIENTO
BULB BEARING SEAWEED OF WHICH THE OPEN SEA AT THE POLE HAD REVEALED A FEW SPECIMENS WITH THEIR SMOOTH VISCOUS FILAMENTS THEY MEASURED AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED METERS LONG GENUINE CABLES MORE THAN AN INCH THICK AND VERY TOUGH
IN THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP FINE SAMPLES OF ALGAE IN PARTICULAR CERTAIN FUCUS PLANTS WHOSE ROOTS WERE LADEN WITH THE WORLD'S BEST MUSSELS
BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY FIVE METERS AND WENT ALONG THE SOUTH AMERICAN COAST
WHY WHAT IS IT WHAT ABOUT SHE ASKED SITTING DOWN WELL LET'S TALK IF IT'S SO NECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GET TO SLEEP ANNA SAID WHAT CAME TO HER LIPS AND MARVELED HEARING HERSELF AT HER OWN CAPACITY FOR LYING
THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO SAY A WORD ABOUT HERSELF MEANT A GREAT DEAL HE SAW THAT THE INMOST RECESSES OF HER SOUL THAT HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO LAIN OPEN BEFORE HIM WERE CLOSED AGAINST HIM MORE THAN THAT HE SAW FROM HER TONE
ANNA IS THIS YOU SAID ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH QUIETLY MAKING AN EFFORT OVER HIMSELF AND RESTRAINING THE MOTION OF HIS FINGERS
TO MYSELF AND TO GOD TO POINT OUT TO YOU YOUR DUTIES OUR LIFE HAS BEEN JOINED NOT BY MAN BUT BY GOD THAT UNION CAN ONLY BE SEVERED BY A CRIME AND A CRIME OF THAT NATURE BRINGS ITS OWN CHASTISEMENT
WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE BEDROOM HE WAS ALREADY IN BED HIS LIPS WERE STERNLY COMPRESSED AND HIS EYES LOOKED AWAY FROM HER ANNA GOT INTO HER BED AND LAY EXPECTING EVERY MINUTE THAT HE WOULD BEGIN TO SPEAK TO HER AGAIN SHE BOTH FEARED HIS SPEAKING AND WISHED FOR IT
SHE HEARD AN EVEN TRANQUIL SNORE FOR THE FIRST INSTANT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SEEMED AS IT WERE APPALLED AT HIS OWN SNORING AND CEASED BUT AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWO BREATHINGS THE SNORE SOUNDED AGAIN
EVERY PERSON WHO MIGHT VENTURE WITHIN HIS REACH THERE ARE OTHER DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG PRINCES
I DO NOT WONDER THAT YOU THINK THE DRAGON VERY TERRIBLE YOU HAVE GROWN UP FROM INFANCY IN THE FEAR OF THIS MONSTER
WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS WHICH YOU MUST FULFILL BEFORE GETTING POSSESSION OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE I HAVE HEARD REJOINED THE YOUTH THAT A DRAGON LIES BENEATH THE TREE ON WHICH THE PRIZE HANGS AND THAT WHOEVER APPROACHES HIM RUNS THE RISK OF BEING DEVOURED AT A MOUTHFUL
I CAN INSTRUCT YOU HOW TO TAME THE FIERY BULLS AND SOW THE DRAGON'S TEETH AND GET THE GOLDEN FLEECE INDEED BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS ANSWERED JASON IF YOU WILL DO ME THIS SERVICE I PROMISE TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU MY WHOLE LIFE LONG GAZING AT MEDEA
THESE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WERE CAUSED BY THE BREATH OF THE BRAZEN BULLS WHICH WAS QUIETLY STEALING OUT OF THEIR FOUR NOSTRILS AS THEY LAY CHEWING THEIR CUDS AT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE STEPS WHICH JASON MADE
THE FOUR FIERY STREAMS APPEARED TO GUSH OUT SOMEWHAT MORE PLENTIFULLY FOR THE TWO BRAZEN BULLS HAD HEARD HIS FOOT TRAMP AND WERE LIFTING UP THEIR HOT NOSES TO SNUFF THE AIR HE WENT A LITTLE FARTHER
ONE OTHER STRIDE DID BOLD JASON MAKE AND SUDDENLY AS A STREAK OF LIGHTNING ON CAME THESE FIERY ANIMALS
AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FASHION WITH ANGRY BULLS THEIR BREATH SCORCHED THE HERBAGE BEFORE THEM SO INTENSELY HOT IT WAS INDEED THAT IT CAUGHT A DRY TREE UNDER WHICH JASON WAS NOW STANDING AND SET IT ALL IN A LIGHT BLAZE BUT AS FOR JASON HIMSELF
GREATLY ENCOURAGED AT FINDING HIMSELF NOT YET TURNED INTO A CINDER
JUST AS THE BRAZEN BRUTES FANCIED THEMSELVES SURE OF TOSSING HIM INTO THE AIR HE CAUGHT ONE OF THEM BY THE HORN AND THE OTHER BY HIS SCREWED UP TAIL AND HELD THEM IN A GRIPE LIKE THAT OF AN IRON VICE ONE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THE OTHER WITH HIS LEFT
WHEN DANGER ASSAILS THEM TO DO WHAT THEY CALL TAKING THE BULL BY THE HORNS AND TO GRIPE HIM BY THE TAIL IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING THAT IS TO THROW ASIDE FEAR AND OVERCOME THE PERIL BY DESPISING IT
MUST WE WAIT LONG FOR HARVEST TIME HE INQUIRED OF MEDEA WHO WAS NOW STANDING BY HIS SIDE WHETHER SOONER OR LATER IT WILL BE SURE TO COME ANSWERED THE PRINCESS A CROP OF ARMED MEN NEVER FAILS TO SPRING UP WHEN THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN
THE ARMED MEN WERE NOW SO NIGH THAT JASON COULD DISCERN THE FIRE FLASHING OUT OF THEIR ENRAGED EYES WHEN HE LET FLY THE STONE AND SAW IT STRIKE THE HELMET OF A TALL WARRIOR WHO WAS RUSHING UPON HIM WITH HIS BLADE ALOFT
AND INSTEAD OF RUNNING ANY FARTHER TOWARDS JASON THEY BEGAN TO FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES THE CONFUSION SPREAD THROUGH THE HOST
HEWING AND STABBING AT ONE ANOTHER LOPPING OFF ARMS HEADS AND LEGS AND DOING SUCH MEMORABLE DEEDS THAT JASON WAS FILLED WITH IMMENSE ADMIRATION ALTHOUGH AT THE SAME TIME HE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING TO BEHOLD THESE MIGHTY MEN PUNISHING EACH OTHER
WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PUT LAUREL WREATHS ON THEIR RUSTY AND BATTERED HELMETS COULD YOU HELP SMILING PRINCE JASON TO SEE THE SELF CONCEIT OF THAT LAST FELLOW
AND DEPART WITH MY NINE AND FORTY COMRADES
AND LOOKED VERY ANGRY AND EXCESSIVELY DISTURBED FOR HE KNEW THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS KINGLY PROMISE HE OUGHT NOW TO PERMIT JASON TO WIN THE FLEECE IF HIS COURAGE AND SKILL SHOULD ENABLE HIM TO DO SO BUT SINCE THE YOUNG MAN HAD MET WITH SUCH GOOD LUCK IN THE MATTER OF THE BRAZEN BULLS
AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD DONE HIM SO MUCH SERVICE ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE HE WAS BY NO MEANS VERY CERTAIN THAT SHE WOULD NOT DO HIM AN EQUALLY GREAT MISCHIEF BEFORE SUNSET THESE ENCHANTRESSES YOU MUST KNOW ARE NEVER TO BE DEPENDED UPON
AND HE FORBIDS ME TO MAKE ANY MORE ATTEMPTS AND POSITIVELY REFUSES TO GIVE UP THE GOLDEN FLEECE WHETHER I SLAY THE DRAGON OR NO YES JASON SAID THE PRINCESS AND I CAN TELL YOU MORE UNLESS YOU SET SAIL FROM COLCHIS
HOW THEY CONTRIVED TO KEEP THEMSELVES ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE BUT NOW INSTEAD OF EMITTING JETS OF FLAME AND STREAMS OF SULPHUROUS VAPOR THEY BREATHED THE VERY SWEETEST OF COW BREATH AFTER KINDLY PATTING THE BULLS
WHAT IS IT ASKED JASON HAVE YOU COME SO FAR TO SEEK IT
WHEN IT GLITTERS BEFORE YOUR EYES IT IS THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON WENT ONWARD A FEW STEPS FARTHER AND THEN STOPPED TO GAZE O HOW BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKED SHINING WITH A MARVELOUS LIGHT OF ITS OWN THAT
SO I DID NOT WISH TO KILL HIM OUTRIGHT QUICK SNATCH THE PRIZE AND LET US BEGONE YOU HAVE WON THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON CAUGHT THE FLEECE FROM THE TREE
HELD PERPENDICULARLY READY TO LET FALL INTO THE WATER AS JASON DREW NEAR HE HEARD THE TALKING IMAGE CALLING TO HIM WITH MORE THAN ORDINARY EAGERNESS IN ITS GRAVE SWEET VOICE MAKE HASTE PRINCE JASON FOR YOUR LIFE MAKE HASTE
HAD NOTHING TO DO IT WAS CONCERNED ONLY WITH THE EFFORT TO OBTAIN FOR WOMEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE EFFECTIVE EXPRESSION THROUGH POLITICAL POWER TO THEIR IDEALS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT BE
IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE TO US IN THAT IT MADE OUR ATTACK MORE DRAMATIC ONE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPECCABLE WAS MORE VULNERABLE IT WAS A DISADVANTAGE TO HAVE TO OVERCOME THIS UNIVERSAL TRUST AND WORLD WIDE POPULARITY
SOME RUMBLINGS OF POLITICAL ACTION BEGAN TO BE HEARD THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY HAD APPOINTED A SENATE COMMITTEE ON WOMAN SUFFRAGE WHOSE MEMBERS WERE OVERWHELMINGLY FOR FEDERAL ACTION THE CHAIRMAN SENATOR ANDREAS JONES OF NEW MEXICO
IN ADDITION TO THIS PLANK THEY ADOPTED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME
THAT WE WERE ADVANCING TO THAT POSITION WHERE WE WERE AS GOOD POLITICAL MATERIAL TO BE CONTESTED OVER BY OPPOSING POLITICAL GROUPS AS WAS A MONUMENT TO A DEAD PRESIDENT AND IF THE DEMOCRATS COULD DEFEND SUCH AN ISSUE AS A WAR MEASURE
BECAUSE WOMEN WERE HOLDING BANNERS ASKING FOR THE PRECIOUS PRINCIPLE AT HOME THAT MEN WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DYING FOR ABROAD FINALLY A DECISION WAS REACHED EMBODYING THE COMBINED WISDOM OF ALL THE VARIOUS CONFEREES
NEWS HAD SPREAD THROUGH THE CITY THAT THE PICKETS WERE TO BE ARRESTED A MODERATELY LARGE CROWD HAD GATHERED TO SEE THE FUN ONE HAS ONLY TO COME INTO CONFLICT WITH PREVAILING AUTHORITY WHETHER RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY TO FIND FRIENDLY HOSTS VANISHING WITH LIGHTNING SPEED
TO KNOW THAT WE WERE NO LONGER WANTED AT THE GATES OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND THAT THE POLICE WERE NO LONGER OUR FRIENDS WAS ENOUGH FOR THE MOB MIND SOME MEMBERS OF THE CROWD MADE SPORT OF THE WOMEN OTHERS HURLED CHEAP AND CHILDISH EPITHETS AT THEM SMALL BOYS WERE ALLOWED TO CAPTURE SOUVENIRS
AND NEVER BROUGHT TO TRIAL THE FOLLOWING DAY JUNE TWENTY THIRD MORE ARRESTS WERE MADE TWO WOMEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE TWO AT THE CAPITOL ALL CARRIED BANNERS WITH THE SAME WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT THERE WAS NO HESITATION THIS TIME THEY WERE PROMPTLY ARRESTED FOR OBSTRUCTING THE TRAFFIC
THEY TOO WERE DISMISSED AND THEIR CASES NEVER TRIED
WHEN HOWEVER WOMEN CONTINUED TO PICKET IN THE FACE OF ARREST THE ADMINISTRATION QUICKENED ITS ADVANCE INTO THE VENTURE OF SUPPRESSION IT DECIDED TO BRING THE OFFENDERS TO TRIAL ON JUNE TWENTY SIXTH
AS ONE PRISONER CONFIDED TO MISS JOY YOUNG IT DEVELOPED THAT ORDERS HAD BEEN RECEIVED AT THE JAIL IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ARRESTS AND BEFORE THE TRIAL TO MAKE READY FOR THE SUFFRAGETTES WHAT DID IT MATTER THAT THEIR CASE HAD NOT YET BEEN HEARD
IT WAS ALL A MERRY LITTLE RING AND ITS CAVALIER ATTITUDE TOWARD THE LAW TOWARD JUSTICE AND ABOVE ALL TOWARD WOMEN WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE THE WORLD WAS ON FIRE WITH A GRAND BLAZE THIS TINY FLAME WOULD SCARCELY BE VISIBLE
CHAIRMAN FURNISHED WITHOUT CHARGE TO ALL NEWSPAPERS POST OFFICES GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES OF A PUBLIC CHARACTER FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF OFFICIAL NEWS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WASHINGTON JULY THIRD NINETEEN SEVENTEEN
AND REPORTERS NOT TO ENCOURAGE US IN OUR PECULIAR CONDUCT BY PRINTING DEFIES TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES EVEN WHEN FLAUNTED ON A PRETTY LITTLE PURPLE AND GOLD BANNER AND EXHORTS THE PUBLIC TO CONTROL ITS THRILLS
THE OFFICIAL BULLETIN CONCLUDES WITH IT IS A FACT THAT THERE REMAINS IN AMERICA ONE MAN WHO HAS KNOWN EXACTLY THE RIGHT ATTITUDE TO TAKE AND MAINTAIN TOWARD THE PICKETS
AND FINALLY WITH AN ADMONITION THAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
THIS ENTIRE SPECTACLE WAS ENACTED ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH WITHIN A STONE'S THROW OF THE WHITE HOUSE MISS PAUL SUMMED UP THE SITUATION WHEN SHE SAID THE SITUATION NOW EXISTING IN WASHINGTON EXISTS BECAUSE PRESIDENT WILSON PERMITS IT
AND THE FOLLOWING DAY A DELEGATION LEFT FOR WASHINGTON I CITE THIS EXPERIENCE OF MINE BECAUSE IT WAS TYPICAL EVERY ONE WHO WENT THROUGH THE COUNTRY TELLING THE STORY HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES AT THIS TIME INDIGNATION WAS SWIFT AND HOT
UNEASINESS IN DEMOCRATIC CIRCLES ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE PICKETS AGAIN ATTEMPTED TO TAKE THEIR POSTS ON THE LINE ON THIS DAY ONE LETTERED BANNER AND FIFTY PURPLE WHITE AND GOLD FLAGS WERE DESTROYED BY A MOB LED BY SAILORS IN UNIFORM
THUS SQUIRES SHOULD BE SWINDLED IN LONG ROOMS PANELLED WITH OAK WHILE JEWS ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD RATHER FIND THEMSELVES UNEXPECTEDLY PENNILESS
A HOUSE WITH A MONKEY TREE ENOUGH YOU KNOW THE SPECIES I REALLY THINK MY IMITATION OF DICKENS'S STYLE WAS DEXTEROUS AND LITERARY IT SEEMS ALMOST A PITY
I REPENTED THE SAME EVENING FLAMBEAU WOULD THEN PROCEED TO TELL THE STORY FROM THE INSIDE AND EVEN FROM THE INSIDE IT WAS ODD SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE
ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE STOOD THE STABLE ON THE OTHER AN ALLEY OR CLOISTER OF LAURELS LED TO THE LARGER GARDEN BEHIND THE YOUNG LADY HAVING SCATTERED BREAD FOR THE BIRDS
HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH THINGS SHE REMONSTRATED WELL SAID THE YOUNG MAN IF YOU'RE BORN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE WALL I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S WRONG TO CLIMB OVER IT
RUBY ADAMS ADDED HE IS VERY KIND JOHN CROOK JOURNALIST HAD HEARD OF THAT EMINENT CITY MAGNATE AND IT WAS NOT HIS FAULT IF THE CITY MAGNATE
HAD NOT HEARD OF HIM FOR IN CERTAIN ARTICLES IN THE CLARION OR THE NEW AGE SIR LEOPOLD HAD BEEN DEALT WITH AUSTERELY BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND GRIMLY WATCHED THE UNLOADING OF THE MOTOR CAR
OVER WHICH HUNG THE COLONEL'S SWORD THE PROCESS WAS COMPLETED AND THE COMPANY INCLUDING THE SATURNINE CROOK PRESENTED TO SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER THAT VENERABLE FINANCIER HOWEVER
BUT EVEN THE ROUGH MEN ABOUT IN THE STREETS AND HOTELS COULD HARDLY HAVE KEPT THEIR HANDS OFF THEM I MIGHT HAVE LOST THEM ON THE ROAD HERE IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE QUITE NATURAL I SHOULD SAY
A SAINT SAID FATHER BROWN I THINK SAID SIR LEOPOLD WITH A SUPERCILIOUS SMILE THAT RUBY MEANS A SOCIALIST
A RADICAL DOES NOT MEAN A MAN WHO LIVES ON RADISHES REMARKED CROOK WITH SOME IMPATIENCE AND A CONSERVATIVE DOES NOT MEAN A MAN WHO PRESERVES JAM NEITHER I ASSURE YOU
PUT IN THE PRIEST IN A LOW VOICE TO OWN YOUR OWN SOOT CROOK LOOKED AT HIM WITH AN EYE OF INTEREST AND EVEN RESPECT DOES ONE WANT TO OWN SOOT HE ASKED ONE MIGHT
OH SPLENDID CRIED RUBY OH I WISH YOU'D DO IT TO THIS COMPANY THE BOISTEROUS CANADIAN MISTER BLOUNT WAS LIFTING HIS LOUD VOICE IN APPLAUSE
I'M SICK AT BEING SUCH A NUISANCE COLONEL HE SAID WITH THE CHEERY COLONIAL CONVENTIONS BUT WOULD IT UPSET YOU IF AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE CALLED ON ME HERE TONIGHT ON BUSINESS IN POINT OF FACT IT'S FLORIAN
THAT FAMOUS FRENCH ACROBAT AND COMIC ACTOR I KNEW HIM YEARS AGO OUT WEST HE WAS A FRENCH CANADIAN BY BIRTH AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE BUSINESS FOR ME THOUGH I HARDLY GUESS WHAT
CLOWN COLUMBINE AND SO ON I SAW ONE WHEN I LEFT ENGLAND AT TWELVE YEARS OLD AND IT'S BLAZED IN MY BRAIN LIKE A BONFIRE EVER SINCE I CAME BACK TO THE OLD COUNTRY ONLY LAST YEAR
AND I FIND THE THING'S EXTINCT NOTHING BUT A LOT OF SNIVELLING FAIRY PLAYS I WANT A HOT POKER AND A POLICEMAN MADE INTO SAUSAGES AND THEY GIVE ME PRINCESSES MORALISING BY MOONLIGHT BLUE BIRDS
ALMOST DANCING I'LL BE COLUMBINE AND YOU SHALL BE PANTALOON THE MILLIONAIRE HELD HIMSELF STIFF WITH A SORT OF HEATHEN SOLEMNITY I THINK MY DEAR HE SAID
WE CAN ACT IT IN THIS VERY HALL THE AUDIENCE SITTING ON THOSE BROAD STAIRS OPPOSITE ONE ROW ABOVE ANOTHER THESE FRONT DOORS CAN BE THE BACK SCENE EITHER OPEN OR SHUT SHUT
THAT STRANGELY RESEMBLED THE LARGE LAMP SHADE IN THE DRAWING ROOM THE CLOWN AND PANTALOON MADE THEMSELVES WHITE WITH FLOUR FROM THE COOK AND RED WITH ROUGE FROM SOME OTHER DOMESTIC WHO REMAINED
WENT ROUND TO THE FRONT AND SAT AMONG THE AUDIENCE WITH ALL THE SOLEMN EXPECTATION OF A CHILD AT HIS FIRST MATINEE THE SPECTATORS WERE FEW RELATIONS ONE OR TWO LOCAL FRIENDS
AND NOW SAID CORONEL WE'D BETTER DECIDE WHAT TO DO BUT I DON'T MIND WHAT WE DO NOW SAID HYACINTH HAPPILY SHE MAY HAVE THE THRONE AND FATHER AND UDO AND
NO DOUBT THEY TOLD EACH OTHER THAT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH BLESS HER PRETTY FACE HAD FOUND HER MAN AT LAST
YOU ARE MY PRINCE SAID HYACINTH PROUDLY MY DEAR I AM A KING AMONG MEN TO DAY AND YOU ARE MY QUEEN BUT THAT'S IN OUR OWN SPECIAL COUNTRY OF TWO IF YOU ARE SO PARTICULAR SAID HYACINTH WITH A SMILE
HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AT THE EXPRESSION ON BELVANE'S FACE SHE WAS LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER AT SOMETHING BEHIND HIM WHY WHOEVER IS THIS SHE SAID GETTING TO HER FEET BEFORE UDO HAD COMPLETELY CLEARED HIS MIND OF HIS DRAGON
THE PRINCESS AND CORONEL WERE UPON THEM AH COUNTESS I THOUGHT WE SHOULD FIND YOU TOGETHER SAID HYACINTH ARCHLY LET ME PRESENT TO YOU MY FRIEND THE DUKE CORONEL
A DIFFERENT THING COUNTESS FROM WHEN I LAST SAW HIM
AH WHAT A MIRACLE WORKER TRUE LOVE IS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH MADE BELVANE SO REMARKABLE WAS THAT SHE WAS NEVER AFRAID OF REMAINING SILENT WHEN SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO SAY
THE COUNTESS AND I WERE JUST HAVING A LITTLE I WAS JUST TELLING HER WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT HOW DID YOU GET HERE CORONEL SHALL WE TELL HIM SAID CORONEL WITH A SMILE AT HYACINTH HYACINTH NODDED
MORE THAN ADVISER SHE GUESSED TO HYACINTH HER OWN POSITION WOULD NOT BE IN MUCH DOUBT AND AS FOR THE KING IT MIGHT BE MONTHS BEFORE HE CAME BACK AND WHEN HE DID COME WOULD HE REMEMBER HER
UDO AND I HERE SHE SQUEEZED THE HAND AND FINDING IT WAS CORONEL'S TOOK UDO'S BOLDLY WITHOUT ANY MORE MAIDENLY NONSENSE UDO AND I LOVE EACH OTHER SAY SOMETHING UDO
YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT HIS MAJESTY COMES BACK TO MORROW WITH ALL HIS ARMY SHE DID NOT SWOON OR UTTER A CRY SHE DID NOT PLEAD THE VAPOURS OR THE MEGRIMS

PROTESTED UDO INDIGNANTLY
SAID UDO STIFFLY WELL PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT I HOPE THAT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOU ON THE WAY UDO WHO WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE PALACE TURNED ROUND WITH A STARTLED LOOK WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I MUST ASK YOU NOT TO REFER TO IT IF I MARRY THE COUNTESS YOU'LL BE A VERY LUCKY MAN PUT IN CORONEL I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT THE KING OF EURALIA HOWEVER SHE'S CHOSEN YOU IT SEEMS
SO FAR AS IS KNOWN THIS WAS HER ONLY WORK BUT SHE BUILT UP SOME REPUTATION ON IT AND BELVANE WHO WAS A GOOD JUDGE HAD A HIGH OPINION OF HER GENIUS TO BE EXACT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE MEN
HYACINTH WOULD BE GROWING UP AND GETTING MARRIED SOON LIFE WOULD BE LONELY IN EURALIA THEN UNLESS SHOULD HE RISK IT
HE TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND ADDRESSED HIS TROOPS MEN OF EURALIA CHEERS WE HAVE RETURNED FROM A LONG AND ARDUOUS CONFLICT CHEERS TO THE EMBRACES LOUD CHEERS
NOW FATHER SAID HYACINTH LATER ON WHEN MERRIWIG HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHES AND REFRESHED HIMSELF YOU'VE GOT TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT'S REALLY OVER YES YES IT'S ALL OVER
SAID MERRIWIG HEARTILY WE SHAN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE IN THAT DIRECTION AGAIN I FANCY DO TELL ME DID THE KING OF BARODIA APOLOGISE HE DID BETTER THAN THAT HE ABDICATED WHY
WELL SAID MERRIWIG REMEMBERING JUST IN TIME I ER KILLED HIM OH FATHER HOW ROUGH OF YOU I DON'T THINK IT HURT HIM VERY MUCH MY DEAR
NEATLY TIED UP WITH BLUE RIBBON FATHER HE PICKED OUT THE LEFT ONE FONS ET ORIGO IF HE HAD KNOWN ANY LATIN OF THE WAR AND HELD IT UP FOR HYACINTH'S INSPECTION THERE YOU CAN SEE THE PLACE WHERE HENRY SMALLNOSE'S ARROW BENT IT
HE WOULD SAY THESE ARE MATTERS FOR MEN TO DISCUSS BUT HYACINTH WOULD KNOW QUITE WELL WHY SHE HAD BEEN SENT OUT AND WOULD CERTAINLY TELL CORONEL THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER AFTERWARDS IT REALLY LOOKED AS IF CORONEL WOULD HAVE TO BE LET INTO THE SECRET TOO
BUT ON THIS OCCASION MISS ELIZABETH WAS NOT ARRAYED IN THE SNUFF COLORED SATIN AND WHEN THEY ENTERED PRISCILLA WAS KNEELING DOWN UPON THE HEARTH RUG STRAIGHTENING OUT AN OBSTREPEROUS FOLD IN IT SHE ROSE COLLECTEDLY AT ONCE AND AS HER FACE TURNED TOWARD THEM
SHE HAD A PALE HANDSOME UNGIRLISH FACE A MINERVA FACE STEADY GRAVE HANDSOME EYES AND A FINE HEAD UNADORNED SAVE WITH A CLASSIC KNOT OF BLACK BROWN HAIR THE PICTURE WAS NOT EVEN YOUNGER LOOKING THAN PRISCILLA WAS NOW
EULOGIZING PRISCILLA AND HER BETROTHED AFFECTIONATELY MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE WOULD BE A RICH MAN SOME OF THESE DAYS AND THEN WHAT A HAPPY LIFE MUST PRISCILLA'S BE SO YOUNG SO BEAUTIFUL SO BELOVED NOT THAT WEALTH BRINGS HAPPINESS MY DEAR MISS THEODORA
AND MY AFFAIRS ARE IN SUCH A CONDITION THAT I MAY BE COMPELLED TO REMAIN ACROSS THE CHANNEL FOR SOME TIME BE GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY TO LADY THROCKMORTON THAT I REGRET DEEPLY THAT I COULD NOT SEE HER BEFORE GOING BUT BUT THE NEWS HAS BEEN SUDDEN AND MY TIME IS FULLY OCCUPIED
SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND THROUGH THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AND FOR A MOMENT HE HELD IT TO ALL APPEARANCE QUITE CALM AS HE LOOKED DOWN AT THE LOVELY FACE THE FLARE OF AN ADJACENT GASLIGHT REVEALED TO HIM AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF SHADOW
MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE HAS GONE AWAY HE WILL NOT COME BACK AGAIN UNTIL JULY WHEN HE IS TO MARRY MISS GOWER THIS WAS THE LAST ENTRY RECORDED IN THE LITTLE PINK AND GOLD JOURNAL AND AFTER IT CAME A GAP OF MONTHS
AND WONDERED GUILELESSLY HOW MATTERS COULD END WITH PERFECT JUSTICE TO PRISCILLA GOWER THE HOUSEHOLD SEEMED RATHER QUIET AFTER THE CHANGE MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE WAS A MAN TO BE MISSED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEO WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO MISSED HIM
LADY THROCKMORTON MISSED HIM ALSO BUT SHE HAD THE SOLACE OF HER NOVELS AND HER CHOCOLATE WHICH THEO HAD NOT NOVELS HAD BEEN DELIGHTFUL AT DOWNPORT WHEN THEY WERE READ IN HOURLY FEAR OF THE TASKS THAT ALWAYS INTERFERED TO PREVENT ANY INDULGENCE
NO SHE REPLIED ALMOST TIMIDLY PAMELA IS FAIRER THAN I AM AND NOT SO TALL WE ARE NOT ALIKE AT ALL I WAS NOT THINKING OF THAT SAID PRISCILLA I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WERE ALIKE IN DISPOSITION I THINK I WAS WONDERING MOST WHETHER YOU WOULD BE AS FAITHFUL AS PAMELA
I REMEMBER HEARING MISTER OGLETHORPE SAY ONCE YOU WOULD BE THEO DROPPED HER IVORY CROCHET NEEDLE AND BENT TO PICK IT UP WITH A BLURRED VISION AND NERVOUS FINGERS I CANNOT TELL SHE SAID
SHE TALKED TO HER OFTENER AND SEEMED TO LISTEN WHILE SHE TALKED EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS BUSY AT THE TIME SHE SAID TO HER ONCE THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW PAMELA AND EMBOLDENED BY THIS THEO VENTURED TO BRING ONE OF PAM'S LETTERS TO READ TO HER
SHE HAD THAT EVENING RECEIVED A LETTER FROM DENIS HERSELF AND IT HAD SUGGESTED AN IDEA TO HER I HAVE BEEN THINKING THEO SHE SAID THAT WE MIGHT TAKE A RUN OVER THE CHANNEL OURSELVES I HAVE NOT BEEN IN PARIS FOR FOUR YEARS AND I BELIEVE THE CHANGE WOULD DO ME GOOD
AT THIS MOMENT POLTON MADE A SILENT APPEARANCE ON THE STAIRS LEADING FROM THE LABORATORY GIVING ME QUITE A START AND I WAS ABOUT TO RETIRE INTO THE ROOM WHEN MY EAR CAUGHT THE TINKLE OF A HANSOM APPROACHING FROM PAPER BUILDINGS
SO JOHN HORNBY HAS BEEN PLUNGING IN MINES EH HE SAID WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER AT HIS AGE DID YOU LEARN HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN IN DIFFICULTIES NO BUT IT CAN HARDLY HAVE BEEN QUITE SUDDEN AND UNFORESEEN I SHOULD THINK NOT THORNDYKE AGREED
REALLY ADDS TO THE ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE DULLEST MIND CAN PERCEIVE THE OBVIOUS AS FOR INSTANCE THE IMPORTANCE OF A FINGER PRINT YOU HAVE REALLY DONE A GREAT THING AND I CONGRATULATE YOU FOR YOU HAVE EMANCIPATED YOURSELF AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT
WAS THE CRIME COMMITTED BY THE PERSON WHO MADE THIS FINGER PRINT THAT IS WHERE THE CORROBORATION IS REQUIRED THAT PRACTICALLY LEAVES THE CASE TO BE INVESTIGATED WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE FINGER PRINT WHICH THUS BECOMES OF NO IMPORTANCE NOT AT ALL REJOINED THORNDYKE
THE FINGER PRINT IS A MOST VALUABLE CLUE AS LONG AS ITS EVIDENTIAL VALUE IS NOT EXAGGERATED TAKE OUR PRESENT CASE FOR INSTANCE WITHOUT THE THUMB PRINT THE ROBBERY MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY ANYBODY THERE IS NO CLUE WHATEVER
NOW PUTTING ASIDE THE SOME OTHER PERSON FOR CONSIDERATION ONLY IF THE FIRST THREE HYPOTHESES FAIL WE HAVE LEFT REUBEN WALTER AND JOHN BUT IF WE LEAVE THE THUMB PRINT OUT OF THE QUESTION THE PROBABILITIES EVIDENTLY POINT TO JOHN HORNBY
AND SHINY TOP BOOTS HIS LONG LEGS ENABLED HIM TO OUTSTRIP THE OTHERS AND IN AN ALMOST BREATHLESS VOICE HE BEGGED UNCLE JOHN TO CHOOSE HIS CARRIAGE THE BESTA CARROZZA INA TOWN WE DON'T WANT TO RIDE WAS THE ANSWER THE CABMAN IMPLORED
CERTAINLY THEY MUST MAKE THE AMALFI DRIVE
THE HORSES AS SOON AS THE STRAIN UPON THEIR BITS WAS RELAXED WERE EASILY QUIETED
WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN THE YEAR TWELVE TWELVE FROM THE ARBORED VERANDA OF THIS CHARMING RETREAT IS OBTAINED ONE OF THE FINEST VIEWS IN EUROPE AND WHILE THE GIRLS SAT ENJOYING IT UNCLE JOHN ARRANGED WITH A PLEASANT FACED WOMAN
BUT THERE WERE FEW TEARS SHED FOR JANE MERRICK AND THE NEW REGIME COULD NOT FAIL TO BE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE LAST
WAS MADE SUBSEQUENT TO THE ONE UNDER WHICH JANE MERRICK INHERITED AND THEREFORE SUPERCEDES IT
MISTER BRADLEY HAVING PROVIDED FOR THAT MOST FULLY FOR THIS REASON THE WILL I READ TO YOU YESTERDAY IS OF NO EFFECT AND KENNETH FORBES INHERITS FROM HIS UNCLE THROUGH HIS MOTHER ALL OF THE ESTATE BLANK LOOKS FOLLOWED MISTER WATSON'S STATEMENT
PATSY LAUGHED SHE FELT WONDERFULLY RELIEVED WASN'T I THE GRAND LADY THOUGH WITH ALL THE FORTUNE I NEVER HAD SHE CRIED MERRILY BUT TWAS REALLY FINE TO BE RICH FOR A DAY AND TOSS THE MONEY AROUND AS IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO DRESS TEN HEADS OF HAIR IN TEN HOURS TO EARN MY BREAD AND BUTTER
LOUISE SMILED IT WAS ALL A GREAT FARCE SHE SAID I SHALL TAKE THE AFTERNOON TRAIN TO THE CITY WHAT AN OLD FRAUD OUR DEAR AUNT JANE WAS AND HOW FOOLISH OF ME TO RETURN HER HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECK I USED MINE SAID BETH BITTERLY
THE LAWYER WHO HAD CONSENTED TO STAY AT THE MANSION FOR A TIME
THAT MAY BE ANSWERED THE BOY
WELCOME SIR NOW AND ALWAYS TO OUR LITTLE HOME IT'S MODEST SIR BUT WHEREVER PATSY IS THE SUN IS SURE TO SHINE I CAN BELIEVE THAT SAID UNCLE JOHN WITH A NOD AND SMILE
IN YOUR CASE IT WON'T MATTER OUR HOUSE IS YOURS AND THERE'S PLENTY AND TO SPARE THANK YOU SAID UNCLE JOHN HIS FACE GRAVE BUT HIS EYES MERRY OH MAJOR CRIED PATSY SUDDENLY
MY HOW HER EYES SPARKLED SHE FAIRLY DANCED FOR JOY AND ORDERED THE DINNER WITH RECKLESS DISREGARD OF THE BILL AH BUT IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK SAID THE LITTLE BOHEMIAN GLEEFULLY THE BIG HOUSE AT ELMHURST WAS GRAND AND STATELY MAJOR BUT THERE WASN'T AN OUNCE OF LOVE IN THE CUPBOARD
DANNY REEVES HIMSELF CAME INSTEAD AND MADE A NICE LITTLE SPEECH SAYING THAT PATSY HAD ALWAYS BROUGHT GOOD LUCK TO THE PLACE AND THIS DINNER WAS HIS TREAT TO WELCOME HER HOME SO THE MAJOR THANKED HIM WITH GRACIOUS DIGNITY AND PATSY KISSED DANNY ON HIS RIGHT CHEEK
THE PLACE WAS SO PLAIN AFTER THE COMPARATIVE LUXURY OF ELMHURST AND ESPECIALLY OF THE ROSE CHAMBER PATSY HAD OCCUPIED THAT THE OLD MAN COULD NOT FAIL TO MARVEL AT THE GIRL'S ECSTATIC JOY TO FIND HERSELF IN THE OLD TENEMENT AGAIN
THERE WAS ONE GOOD SIZED LIVING ROOM WITH AN ANCIENT RAG CARPET PARTIALLY COVERING THE FLOOR A SHEET IRON STOVE A SOFA A TABLE AND THREE OR FOUR OLD FASHIONED CHAIRS THAT HAD PROBABLY COME FROM A SECOND HAND DEALER
WHERE INDEED AH I SEE SAID UNCLE JOHN AND YOU CAN WASH IN MY CHAMBER ADDED THE MAJOR WITH A GRAND AIR AND HANG YOUR CLOTHES ON THE SPARE HOOKS BEHIND MY DOOR I HAVEN'T MANY SAID UNCLE JOHN LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT HIS RED BUNDLE
BUT JUST TO KEEP HIM OUT OF MISCHIEF AND BUSY HE CAN'T HANG AROUND ALL DAY AND BE HAPPY I SUPPOSE I'LL LOOK AROUND ANSWERED THE MAJOR BRISKLY AS IF SUCH A JOB WAS THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD TO PROCURE AND MEANTIME
BUT PATSY IS FAST CURING ME AND AFTER ALL IT'S A WICKED CITY TO BE CARRYING A FAT POCKETBOOK AROUND IN AS I'VE OFTEN OBSERVED MY POCKETBOOK IS NOT EXACTLY FAT REMARKED UNCLE JOHN BUT YOU'VE MONEY SIR FOR I MARKED YOU SQUANDERING IT ON THE TRAIN SAID PATSY SEVERELY
UNCLE JOHN HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN DREW FROM AN INNER POCKET OF HIS COAT A THIN WALLET FROM THIS WHEN SHE HAD RECEIVED IT FROM HIS HAND THE GIRL
GOOD GRACIOUS SHE CRIED DELIGHTEDLY ALL THIS WEALTH AND YOU PLEADING POVERTY I NEVER SAID I WAS A PAUPER RETURNED UNCLE JOHN COMPLACENTLY YOU COULDN'T AND BE TRUTHFUL SIR DECLARED THE GIRL WHY THIS WILL LAST FOR AGES
HE SMOKES OBSERVED THE MAJOR SIGNIFICANTLY BAH A PIPE SAID PATSY AND BULL DURHAM IS ONLY FIVE CENTS A BAG AND A BAG OUGHT TO LAST A WEEK AND EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT SIR
THANK YOU PATSY SAID UNCLE JOHN MEEKLY AND GATHERED UP HIS FORTY TWO CENTS YOU'VE NOW A HOME AND A MANAGER SIR WITH MONEY IN THE BANK OF PATSY AND COMPANY LIMITED
YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY CONTENTED SIR
ANOTHER HOUR PASSED PRESENTLY UNCLE JOHN JUMPED UP AND APPROACHED THE OFFICIAL HASN'T MISTER MARVIN ARRIVED YET HE ENQUIRED SHARPLY AN HOUR AGO WAS THE REPLY THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU LET ME KNOW I WANT TO SEE HIM
HE'S BUSY MORNINGS HAS TO LOOK OVER THE MAIL HE CAN'T SEE YOU YET WELL HE WILL SEE ME AND RIGHT AWAY TELL HIM JOHN MERRICK IS HERE YOUR CARD SIR I HAVEN'T ANY MY NAME WILL DO
UNCLE JOHN HAD BEEN ADVISED BY PATSY WHERE TO GO FOR A GOOD CHEAP LUNCHEON BUT HE DID NOT HEED HER ADMONITION INSTEAD HE RODE IN A CARRIAGE BESIDE THE BANKER TO A SPLENDID CLUB WHERE HE WAS SERVED WITH THE FINEST DISHES THE CHEF COULD PROVIDE ON SHORT NOTICE
HE TALKED WITH EASY FAMILIARITY OF PREFERRED STOCKS AND AMALGAMATED INTERESTS AND INVESTED SECURITIES AND MANY OTHER QUEER THINGS THAT THE BANKER SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND FULLY AND TO LISTEN TO WITH RESPECTFUL DEFERENCE
AND THEN PRESSING HER TO TAKE ANOTHER PIECE OF FRUIT CAKE AND ANOTHER HELPING OF PRESERVES OH MARILLA IT'S A WONDERFUL SENSATION JUST TO THINK OF IT CAN I TAKE HER INTO THE SPARE ROOM TO LAY OFF HER HAT WHEN SHE COMES AND THEN INTO THE PARLOR TO SIT NO
THE SITTING ROOM WILL DO FOR YOU AND YOUR COMPANY BUT THERE'S A BOTTLE HALF FULL OF RASPBERRY CORDIAL THAT WAS LEFT OVER FROM THE CHURCH SOCIAL THE OTHER NIGHT IT'S ON THE SECOND SHELF OF THE SITTING ROOM CLOSET AND YOU AND DIANA CAN HAVE IT IF YOU LIKE
HOW IS YOUR MOTHER INQUIRED ANNE POLITELY JUST AS IF SHE HAD NOT SEEN MISSUS BARRY PICKING APPLES THAT MORNING IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND SPIRITS SHE IS VERY WELL THANK YOU
AND MATTIE ANDREWS HAD A NEW RED HOOD AND A BLUE CROSSOVER WITH TASSELS ON IT AND THE AIRS SHE PUT ON ABOUT IT WERE PERFECTLY SICKENING AND LIZZIE WRIGHT DIDN'T SPEAK TO MAMIE WILSON BECAUSE MAMIE WILSON'S GROWN UP SISTER HAD CUT OUT LIZZIE WRIGHT'S GROWN UP SISTER WITH HER BEAU
AND THEN I TOOK THE SMALLPOX AND DIED AND I WAS BURIED UNDER THOSE POPLAR TREES IN THE GRAVEYARD AND YOU PLANTED A ROSEBUSH BY MY GRAVE AND WATERED IT WITH YOUR TEARS
FANCY IF YOU CAN MY EXTREME HORROR AT FINDING A MOUSE DROWNED IN THAT PUDDING SAUCE I LIFTED THE MOUSE OUT WITH A SPOON AND THREW IT OUT IN THE YARD AND THEN I WASHED THE SPOON IN THREE WATERS
AND AS THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS FROM DAWN TILL DUSK ANNE DID NOT STIR ABROAD FROM GREEN GABLES MONDAY AFTERNOON MARILLA SENT HER DOWN TO MISSUS LYNDE'S ON AN ERRAND IN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ANNE CAME FLYING BACK UP THE LANE WITH TEARS ROLLING DOWN HER CHEEKS
NO ANSWER FROM ANNE SAVE MORE TEARS AND STORMIER SOBS ANNE SHIRLEY WHEN I ASK YOU A QUESTION I WANT TO BE ANSWERED SIT RIGHT UP THIS VERY MINUTE AND TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE CRYING ABOUT ANNE SAT UP TRAGEDY PERSONIFIED
AND SHE SAYS I MUST BE A THOROUGHLY BAD WICKED LITTLE GIRL AND SHE'S NEVER NEVER GOING TO LET DIANA PLAY WITH ME AGAIN OH MARILLA I'M JUST OVERCOME WITH WOE MARILLA STARED IN BLANK AMAZEMENT SET DIANA DRUNK
ALTHOUGH CERTAIN OF THE STRICTER SORT MISSUS BARRY AMONG THEM DISAPPROVED STRONGLY OF IT AND AT THE SAME TIME MARILLA RECOLLECTED THAT SHE HAD PUT THE BOTTLE OF RASPBERRY CORDIAL DOWN IN THE CELLAR
SHE JUST LAUGHED SILLY LIKE WHEN HER MOTHER ASKED HER WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND WENT TO SLEEP AND SLEPT FOR HOURS HER MOTHER SMELLED HER BREATH AND KNEW SHE WAS DRUNK SHE HAD A FEARFUL HEADACHE ALL DAY YESTERDAY MISSUS BARRY IS SO INDIGNANT
SAID MARILLA REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE WISER COURSE DON'T CRY ANY MORE ANNE IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT MARILLA HAD CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT IT BEING ALL RIGHT BY THE TIME SHE GOT BACK FROM ORCHARD SLOPE ANNE WAS WATCHING FOR HER COMING AND FLEW TO THE PORCH DOOR TO MEET HER
MARILLA WHISKED INTO THE KITCHEN GRIEVOUSLY DISTURBED LEAVING A VERY MUCH DISTRACTED LITTLE SOUL IN THE PORCH BEHIND HER PRESENTLY ANNE STEPPED OUT BAREHEADED INTO THE CHILL AUTUMN DUSK
ANNE CLASPED HER HANDS OH MISSUS BARRY PLEASE FORGIVE ME I DID NOT MEAN TO TO INTOXICATE DIANA HOW COULD I JUST IMAGINE IF YOU WERE A POOR LITTLE ORPHAN GIRL THAT KIND PEOPLE HAD ADOPTED
WON'T YOU LET ME SEE DIANA JUST ONCE TO SAY FAREWELL SHE IMPLORED DIANA HAS GONE OVER TO CARMODY WITH HER FATHER SAID MISSUS BARRY GOING IN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR ANNE WENT BACK TO GREEN GABLES CALM WITH DESPAIR
I SAID SOME DREADFUL THINGS TO MISSUS LYNDE LONG AGO BUT IT WAS WHEN I HAD LOST MY TEMPER I COULDN'T SAY THEM DELIBERATELY IT WAS THE TRUTH AND I BELIEVE IN TELLING THE TRUTH TO EVERYBODY
I KNOW I HAVE RED HAIR TOO ALTHOUGH IT'S MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE SO THERE'S NO NEED OF TELLING ME THAT EITHER WELL WELL I'LL TRY AND NOT MENTION IT AGAIN SINCE YOU'RE SO SENSITIVE
AND NEVER SAID A WORD WHEN TIMOTHY COTTON STOLE A CROCK OF BUTTER OUT OF HER DAIRY AND TOLD HIS WIFE HE'D BOUGHT IT FROM HER MISSUS COTTON CAST IT UP TO HER THE NEXT TIME THEY MET THAT IT TASTED OF TURNIPS AND MISSUS LYNDE JUST SAID SHE WAS SORRY IT HAD TURNED OUT SO POORLY
MISTER ROGER PYE IS GOING TO GET THE PAINT IN TOWN TODAY WHO'S GOT THE JOB MISTER JOSHUA PYE OF CARMODY HE HAS NEARLY FINISHED THE SHINGLING WE HAD TO GIVE HIM THE CONTRACT FOR EVERY ONE OF THE PYES AND THERE ARE FOUR FAMILIES YOU KNOW
I NEVER WAS MUCH OF A TALKER TILL I CAME TO AVONLEA AND THEN I HAD TO BEGIN IN SELF DEFENSE OR MISSUS LYNDE WOULD HAVE SAID I WAS DUMB AND STARTED A SUBSCRIPTION TO HAVE ME TAUGHT SIGN LANGUAGE
THE HALL WAS SO CLOSELY SURROUNDED BY FIR WOODS THAT IT WAS INVISIBLE UNLESS YOU WERE NEAR IT MISTER JOSHUA PYE PAINTED AWAY IN THE SOLITUDE AND INDEPENDENCE THAT WERE SO DEAR TO HIS UNSOCIABLE HEART FRIDAY AFTERNOON HE FINISHED HIS JOB AND WENT HOME TO CARMODY
THE NEWS FLEW LIKE WILDFIRE GILBERT BLYTHE PORING OVER A TEXT BOOK AT HOME HEARD IT FROM HIS FATHER'S HIRED BOY AT SUNSET AND RUSHED BREATHLESSLY TO GREEN GABLES JOINED ON THE WAY BY FRED WRIGHT
AND THE MORTON HARRIS PAINT CANS WERE NUMBERED ACCORDING TO A COLOR CARD A PURCHASER CHOSE HIS SHADE ON THE CARD AND ORDERED BY THE ACCOMPANYING NUMBER
AND AS FOR JOSHUA PYE HE MUST BE A BORN FOOL NOT TO SUSPECT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN HE OPENED THE CANS AND SAW THE COLOR OF THE PAINT JOSHUA PYE WHEN THUS ANIMADVERTED UPON RETORTED THAT THE AVONLEA TASTE IN COLORS WAS NO BUSINESS OF HIS
I PUT TEACHER WHERE HE PUT LADY AND I PUT IN SOMETHING OF MY OWN WHEN I COULD THINK OF IT AND I CHANGED SOME WORDS I PUT DRESS IN PLACE OF MOOD
THERE IS NOTHING WEAK OR GIRLISH ABOUT HIM IN SPITE OF HIS DREAMS AND FANCIES HE IS VERY MANLY AND CAN HOLD HIS OWN IN ALL GAMES HE FOUGHT SAINT CLAIR DONNELL RECENTLY BECAUSE SAINT CLAIR SAID THE UNION JACK WAS AWAY AHEAD OF THE STARS AND STRIPES AS A FLAG
SAINT CLAIR SAYS HE CAN HIT THE HARDEST BUT PAUL CAN HIT THE OFTENEST PAUL'S LETTER MY DEAR TEACHER YOU TOLD US WE MIGHT WRITE YOU ABOUT SOME INTERESTING PEOPLE WE KNEW I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING PEOPLE I KNOW ARE MY ROCK PEOPLE
SHE HAS GOLDEN HAIR RIGHT DOWN TO HER FEET AND HER DRESS IS ALL GLITTERING AND GLISTENING LIKE GOLD THAT IS ALIVE AND SHE HAS A GOLDEN HARP AND PLAYS ON IT ALL DAY LONG YOU CAN HEAR THE MUSIC ANY TIME ALONG SHORE IF YOU LISTEN CAREFULLY
BUT MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT WAS ONLY THE WIND AMONG THE ROCKS I'VE NEVER TOLD NORA ABOUT THE GOLDEN LADY I WAS AFRAID IT MIGHT HURT HER FEELINGS IT EVEN HURT HER FEELINGS IF I TALKED TOO LONG WITH THE TWIN SAILORS I ALWAYS MET THE TWIN SAILORS AT THE STRIPED ROCKS
BUT THE OLDEST TWIN SAYS IT WAS ONLY A FEW MINUTES YOU SEE IN THE SUNSET LAND THE TIME IS EVER SO MUCH LONGER THAN IT IS HERE YOUR LOVING PUPIL PAUL IRVING
ANNE TURNED FROM THE SECOND READER CLASS WHICH SHE WAS HEARING REALLY BARBARA SHE SAID ICILY IF YOU CANNOT MOVE WITHOUT FALLING OVER SOMETHING YOU'D BETTER REMAIN IN YOUR SEAT IT IS POSITIVELY DISGRACEFUL FOR A GIRL OF YOUR AGE TO BE SO AWKWARD
TAKE YOUR SEAT AND WORK OUT THE SIX PROBLEMS ON PAGE EIGHTY FOUR OF YOUR ARITHMETIC FOR PUNISHMENT SAID ANNE SAINT CLAIR LOOKED RATHER AMAZED AT HER TONE BUT HE WENT MEEKLY TO HIS DESK AND TOOK OUT HIS SLATE THEN HE STEALTHILY PASSED A SMALL PARCEL TO JOE SLOANE ACROSS THE AISLE
ANNE HAD WARNED THEM THAT IF THEY BROUGHT ANY MORE CAKES TO SCHOOL THEY WOULD BE CONFISCATED AND YET HERE WAS SAINT CLAIR DONNELL COOLLY PASSING A PARCEL OF THEM WRAPPED UP IN THE BLUE AND WHITE STRIPED PAPER MISSUS HIRAM USED UNDER HER VERY EYES
HER VOICE WAS QUITE LOW BUT IT MADE A SHIVER GO UP AND DOWN PAUL IRVING'S SPINE JOE SLOANE CAUGHT HER EYE FELT RESPONSIBLE FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLE OF HIS FEET BUT STUTTERED OUT WILDLY
ANNE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE WRETCHED JOSEPH SHE LOOKED AT ANTHONY PYE AND ANTHONY PYE LOOKED BACK UNABASHED AND UNASHAMED ANTHONY WAS IT YOU YES IT WAS SAID ANTHONY INSOLENTLY
SHE SAT DOWN AT HER DESK FEELING ASHAMED REPENTANT AND BITTERLY MORTIFIED HER QUICK ANGER WAS GONE AND SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEEK RELIEF IN TEARS SO ALL HER BOASTS HAD COME TO THIS SHE HAD ACTUALLY WHIPPED ONE OF HER PUPILS
KEPT BACK HER TEARS UNTIL SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT THEN SHE SHUT HERSELF IN THE EAST GABLE ROOM AND WEPT ALL HER SHAME AND REMORSE AND DISAPPOINTMENT INTO HER PILLOWS WEPT SO LONG THAT MARILLA GREW ALARMED INVADED THE ROOM AND INSISTED ON KNOWING WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO OH NO NO MARILLA AND I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN EVER LOOK THOSE CHILDREN IN THE FACE AGAIN I FEEL THAT I HAVE HUMILIATED MYSELF TO THE VERY DUST YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CROSS AND HATEFUL AND HORRID I WAS
HE IS THE ONLY ONE I CAN'T HELP IT I WANT EVERYBODY TO LOVE ME AND IT HURTS ME SO WHEN ANYBODY DOESN'T AND ANTHONY NEVER WILL NOW OH I JUST MADE AN IDIOT OF MYSELF TODAY MARILLA I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
BUT A SUDDEN OUTFLASHING OF GOOD COMRADESHIP ANTHONY SMILED NO IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD ANTHONY GRINNED BACK A GRIN IS NOT GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A RESPECTFUL THING
MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE CAME UP THE NEXT SATURDAY AND CONFIRMED THIS WELL ANNE I GUESS YOU'VE WON OVER ANTHONY PYE THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS HE BELIEVES YOU ARE SOME GOOD AFTER ALL EVEN IF YOU ARE A GIRL SAYS THAT WHIPPING YOU GAVE HIM WAS JUST AS GOOD AS A MAN'S
NO BUT THE PYES ARE AN EXCEPTION TO EVERY KNOWN RULE THAT'S WHAT DECLARED MISSUS RACHEL WITH CONVICTION
GOOD IDEA COMMENTED MISTER JENKS WE'LL DO IT AND MOVE OUR CAMP I ONLY HOPE THOSE FELLOWS DON'T FIND OUR AIRSHIP AND DESTROY IT WE'LL HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING BACK TO CIVILIZATION AGAIN
THEY RATHER EXPECTED TO SEE THE THING IN WHITE AGAIN THAT NIGHT BUT IT DID NOT APPEAR AND MORNING CAME WITHOUT ANYTHING HAVING DISTURBED THEIR HEAVY SLEEP FOR THEY WERE TIRED FROM THE DAY'S TRAMP
FROM A HIGH PEAK I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF ONE WORKING THIS WAY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS THEN WE'D BETTER FASTEN THE TENT WELL DOWN CALLED TOM WE DON'T WANT IT TO BLOW AWAY
WAS MISTER PARKER'S OPINION FROM WHAT THEN ASKED MISTER JENKS FROM THE DISCHARGES OF LIGHTNING AMONG THESE MOUNTAIN PEAKS WHICH CONTAIN SO MUCH IRON ORE
AND GET READY FOR IT PERHAPS IT MAY NOT BE AS BAD AS MISTER PARKER FEARS IT WILL BE BAD ENOUGH DECLARED THE GLOOMY SCIENTIST AND HE SEEMED TO FIND PLEASURE IN HIS ANNOUNCEMENT
THEY MUST HAVE FOLLOWED US SAID MISTER JENKS IN A LOW VOICE SLOWLY THE FIGURE ADVANCED IT WAVED THE LONG WHITE ARMS AS IF IN WARNING
SHOUTING SO AS TO BE HEARD ABOVE THE ECHOES OF THE THUNDERCLAP ALMOST AS HE SPOKE THERE CAME ANOTHER EXPLOSION EVEN LOUDER THAN THE ONE PRECEDING A GREAT BALL OF FIRE PEAR SHAPED
IN ANOTHER INSTANT IT LOOKED AS IF THE WHOLE PLACE ABOUT WHERE THE DIAMOND SEEKERS STOOD WAS A MASS OF FIRE GREAT FORKED TONGUES OF LIGHTNING LEAPED FROM THE CLOUDS AND SEEMED TO LICK THE GROUND
I HAVE A PLAN TO PROPOSE I WAS HERE LAST SUMMER WITH A COUPLE OF HARVARD MEN AND WE LODGED AT A FARMHOUSE ABOUT A MILE DISTANT FROM THE CATHEDRAL IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE COFFEE ROOM FOR AN HOUR
I'LL WALK UP TO FARMER HENDRY'S AND SEE IF THEY WILL TAKE US IN I THINK WE MIGHT BE FAIRLY COMFORTABLE CAN AUNT CELIA HAVE APOLLINARIS AND BLACK COFFEE AFTER HER MORNING BATH I ASKED I HOPE KATHARINE
IF MISTER COPLEY CAN SECURE APARTMENTS FOR US I SHALL BE MORE THAN GRATEFUL SO HERE WE ARE ALL LODGING TOGETHER IN AN IDEAL ENGLISH FARMHOUSE
I AM SO HAPPY THAT I FEEL AS IF SOMETHING WERE GOING TO SPOIL IT ALL TWENTY YEARS OLD TO DAY I WISH MAMMA WERE ALIVE TO WISH ME MANY HAPPY RETURNS THE CATHEDRAL IS VERY BEAUTIFUL IN ITSELF
AND ITS SITUATION IS BEYOND ALL WORDS OF MINE TO DESCRIBE I GREATLY ADMIRED THE PULPIT WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY FIVE PILLARS SUNK INTO THE BACKS OF SQUASHED LIONS BUT MISTER COPLEY WHEN I ASKED HIM THE PERIOD SAID PURE BRUMMAGEM
DURHAM JULY NINETEENTH
HOW DID IT HAPPEN TO BE ELECTION TIME WHY DID THE INNS CHANCE TO BE FULL
WE WERE WALKING THROUGH THE FIELDS WHILE MISSUS BENEDICT AND AUNT CELIA WERE DRIVING AS WE CAME ACROSS A CORNER OF THE BIT OF MEADOW LAND THAT JOINS THE STABLE AND THE GARDEN WE HEARD A MUFFLED ROAR
FOR THE REST OF HER NATURAL LIFE SHE WITHDREW ENTIRELY NOW ALL BUT HER HAND AND HER EYES SOUGHT THE GROUND I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO THAT IS IF YOU THINK AT LEAST I SUPPOSE YOU DO THINK
SHE REPLIED I WAS FRIGHTENED WITHIN AN INCH OF MY LIFE I TOLD YOU THIS MORNING THAT I WAS DREADFULLY AFRAID OF BULLS ESPECIALLY MAD ONES AND I TOLD YOU THAT MY NURSE FRIGHTENED ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD WITH AWFUL STORIES ABOUT THEM
AND THAT I NEVER OUTGREW MY CHILDISH TERROR I LOOKED EVERYWHERE ABOUT THE BARN WAS TOO FAR THE FENCE TOO HIGH I SAW HIM COMING AND THERE WAS NOTHING BUT YOU AND THE OPEN COUNTRY OF COURSE I TOOK YOU IT WAS VERY NATURAL I'M SURE
SHE CRIED PUTTING HER HAND OVER MY LIPS AND GETTING IT WELL KISSED IN CONSEQUENCE
AS WE APPROACHED THE INN AT AMHERST THE CLOCKMAKER GREW UNEASY IT'S PRETTY WELL ON IN THE EVENING I GUESS SAID HE AND MARM PUGWASH IS AS ONSARTIN IN HER TEMPER AS A MORNIN IN APRIL
THERE WERE SOME TREES HUNG OVER THE FENCE I NEVER SEED SUCH BEARERS THE APPLES HUNG IN ROPES FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE STRINGS OF ONIONS AND THE FRUIT WAS BEAUTIFUL NOBODY TOUCHED THE MINISTER'S APPLES
NEAT PASTERN FINE CHEST A CLEAN SET OF LIMBS AND CARRIES A GOOD BUT HERE WE ARE NOW YOU'LL SEE WHAT SOFT SAWDER WILL DO WHEN WE ENTERED THE HOUSE THE TRAVELERS ROOM WAS ALL IN DARKNESS
THAT ARE LITTLE FELLER WOULD BE A SHOW IN OUR COUNTRY COME TO ME MY MAN HERE THE SOFT SAWDER BEGAN TO OPERATE MISSUS PUGWASH SAID IN A MILDER TONE THAN WE HAD YET HEARD GO MY DEAR TO THE GENTLEMAN
AS THE DOOR CLOSED MISTER SLICK SAID IT'S A PITY SHE DON'T GO WELL IN GEAR THE DIFFICULTY WITH THOSE CRITTERS IS TO GIT THEM TO START ARTER THAT THERE IS NO TROUBLE WITH THEM IF YOU DON'T CHECK EM TOO SHORT IF YOU DO THEY'LL STOP AGAIN
NO SAYS HE SHAKIN HIS HEAD I HOPE I HAVE TOO MUCH CLEAR GRIT IN ME TO TAKE ON SO BAD FOR THAT WHAT UNDER THE SUN IS IT THEN SAID I WHY SAYS HE I MADE A BET
BECAUSE HE IS A STRANGER AND A FOREIGNER WOULD YOU HAVE WISHED ME TO TELL HIM THAT HE MIGHT COME YES PAPA HE WAS SITTING ON A SOFA AND SHRANK BACK A LITTLE FROM HER AS SHE MADE THIS FREE AVOWAL
ALREADY PRONOUNCED YOU KNOW PAPA THAT I TRUST YOU SHE SAID AND I HAVE PROMISED YOU THAT I WILL NOT DISOBEY YOU
I WILL OF COURSE I WILL AND HE BEGAN THE PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HER BUT WHAT WAS THERE TO THINK ABOUT NOTHING THAT SHE HAD SAID ALTERED IN THE LEAST HIS IDEA ABOUT THE MAN
WHETHER IT IS MORE DISHONEST AND WHETHER STRUGGLES WERE NOT MADE QUITE AS DISGRACEFUL TO THE STRUGGLERS AS ANYTHING THAT IS DONE NOW YOU CAN'T ALTER THE MEN AND YOU MUST USE THEM THE YOUNGER DUKE SAT DOWN AND SIGHED OVER THE DEGENERATE PATRIOTISM OF THE AGE
AND HAVE UNCONSCIOUSLY BUT NOT THEREFORE LESS ACTUALLY MADE THEMSELVES INDISPENSABLE EITHER TO THIS SIDE IN POLITICS OR TO THAT CANNOT FREE THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGING THEM WHEN A PERIOD COMES SUCH AS THAT NOW REACHED
WAS AT LAST ASSIGNED TO SIR ORLANDO DROUGHT IT WILL NEVER DO SAID MISTER RATTLER TO MISTER ROBY I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST DROUGHT WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY USEFUL MAN TO YOUR PARTY BUT HE LACKS SOMETHING OF THE POSITION
FOR MYSELF I'D HAVE SOONER STAYED OUT AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER BUT DAUBENY SAID THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS BOUND TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL I TOLD THE DUKE FROM THE BEGINNING SAID RATTLER THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT I COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HIM
OF COURSE I WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT I HAD BEEN TOO THOROUGHLY A PARTY MAN FOR A NEW MOVEMENT OF THIS KIND BUT HE SAID JUST THE SAME THAT HE CONSIDERED I WAS BOUND TO JOIN HIM I ASKED GRESHAM AND WHEN GRESHAM SAID SO TOO OF COURSE I HAD NO HELP FOR IT
THOUGH HE WOULD HARDLY KNOW THE CAUSE OF HIS MISERY HER RIDICULE AND RAILLERY HE COULD BEAR
OR HER SULLENNESS IF EVER SHE WERE SULLEN UPSET HIM ALTOGETHER HE WAS IN TRUTH SO SOFT OF HEART
AND I THINK THAT MAKES IT A VERY LONG TIME AGO LORD SILVERBRIDGE WAS THE DUKE'S ELDEST SON BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF SHE BEGAN HER CAREER IN THE TIME OF GEORGE THE FOURTH WHAT IS IT TO YOU
AND FREE FROM BONDS BY WHICH THEY ARE CRAMPED AND CONFINED OF COURSE SUCH A TURN OF CHARACTER IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DANGERS OF ITS OWN THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE DANGERS THE CHANCES ARE THAT WHEN I SEE HER GRACE I SHALL TELL HER WHAT I THINK ABOUT HER
THE ONE MAN IN PARLIAMENT MODEST ENOUGH NOT TO CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE FIT FOR ANY PLACE THAT CAN BE OFFERED TO HIM POOR BARRINGTON HE DOES NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF CROSSING THE CHANNEL SO OFTEN I QUITE SYMPATHISE WITH HIM AND SO PHINEAS IS TO BE SECRETARY FOR IRELAND
THEY DO MURDER PEOPLE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES HE'S AN IRISHMAN HIMSELF THAT'S JUST THE REASON WHY THEY SHOULD HE MUST PUT UP WITH THAT OF COURSE I WONDER WHETHER SHE'LL LIKE GOING THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND MONEY WHICH THEY ALWAYS LIKE
BUT I DID HAVE SOME PLEASURE IN PROPOSING IT TO HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD PLEASE YOU IT DOES PLEASE ME AND I WON'T BE CROSS ANY MORE AND THE DUCHESS OF
IN REGARD TO MAGNIFICENCE AND HOSPITALITY SHE SAID NOTHING OF ANY EXTRAORDINARY EXPENDITURE OF MONEY BUT SHE SET HERSELF TO WORK AFTER HER OWN FASHION MAKING TO HIM SUGGESTIONS AS TO DINNERS AND EVENING RECEPTIONS
ALL IN SUCH A RAMPANT STATE THAT BUSY MOTHERS WONDERED HOW THEY EVER SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR FRISKY DARLINGS OUT OF MISCHIEF THRIFTY FATHERS PLANNED HOW THEY COULD BRIBE THE IDLE HANDS TO PICK BERRIES OR RAKE HAY AND THE OLD FOLKS
AND GUARDING JACKETS WHEN NOT NEEDED WITH THE AIR OF ONE OF THE OLD GUARD ON DUTY AT THE TOMB OF NAPOLEON BAB ALSO LONGED TO JOIN IN THE FUN WHICH SUITED HER BETTER THAN STUPID PICNICS OR FUSSING OVER DOLLS
GROWLED SAM KITTERIDGE BITTERLY RESENTING THE STERN EDICT WHICH FORBADE FREE BORN CITIZENS TO BURN AS MUCH GUNPOWDER AS THEY LIKED ON THAT GLORIOUS DAY LAST YEAR JIMMY GOT HIS ARM BLOWN OFF WHEN THEY FIRED THE OLD CANNON
THOUGH YOU MIGHT DO FOR A FAT BOY IF SMITHERS WANTED ONE SAID BEN SURVEYING THE STOUT YOUTH WITH CALM CONTEMPT LET'S GO IN SWIMMING NOT LOAF ROUND HERE IF WE CAN'T PLAY

OBSERVING WITH DIGNITY I'VE GOT MONEY ENOUGH TO TREAT THE WHOLE CROWD IF I CHOOSE TO WHICH I DON'T THEN COME ALONG AND HAVE A JOLLY TIME WITH SAM AND ME WE CAN BUY SOME DINNER AND GET A RIDE HOME AS LIKE AS NOT
SAID THE AMIABLE BILLY WITH A SLAP ON THE SHOULDER AND A CORDIAL GRIN WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR BEN TO RESIST WHAT ARE YOU STOPPING FOR DEMANDED SAM READY TO BE OFF THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE IT EASY
SMOOTHING AWAY ALL OBJECTIONS FOR HE LIKED BEN AND SAW THAT HE WANTED TO GO NO I WON'T I DON'T LIKE HIM HE WINKS AT ME AND GROWLS WHEN I TOUCH HIM MUTTERED NAUGHTY CY REMEMBERING HOW MUCH REASON POOR SANCH HAD TO DISTRUST HIS TORMENTOR
SHE ISN'T MY MISSIS NOW MISS CELIA WOULDN'T CARE AND I'M GOING ANY WAY DO DO TAKE ME BEN I'LL BE JUST AS GOOD AS EVER WAS
I SUPPOSE IT WOULDN'T DO HINTED BILLY WITH A LOOK FROM BEN TO THE LITTLE GIRL WHO STOOD WINKING HARD TO KEEP THE TEARS BACK OF COURSE IT WOULDN'T I'D LIKE TO SEE HER WALKING EIGHT MILES
GIRLS ARE SUCH A BOTHER WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOCK ROUND NO BAB YOU CAN'T GO TRAVEL RIGHT HOME AND DON'T MAKE A FUSS COME ALONG BOYS
AND COOL OFF BEFORE PLUNGING INTO THE EXCITEMENTS OF THE AFTERNOON AS THEY STOOD REFRESHING THEMSELVES A BAKER'S CART CAME JINGLING BY AND SAM PROPOSED A HASTY LUNCH WHILE THEY RESTED A SUPPLY OF GINGERBREAD WAS SOON BOUGHT
AS HE LOOKED BEFORE HE LEAPED HE BEHELD A SIGHT WHICH CAUSED HIM TO STARE WITH ALL HIS MIGHT FOR AN INSTANT THEN TURN AND BECKON SAYING IN AN EAGER WHISPER
SANCHO LAPPED EAGERLY WITH HIS EYES SHUT ALL HIS RUFFLES WERE GRAY WITH DUST AND HIS TAIL HUNG WEARILY DOWN THE TASSEL AT HALF MAST AS IF IN MOURNING FOR THE MASTER WHOM HE HAD COME TO FIND
AND THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER ROAD TO THE CIRCUS SEEMS TO ME BAB SPOKE AS IF THE DOG COULD UNDERSTAND AND ANSWER
AND LANDED DIRECTLY ON BEN'S BACK AS HE LAY PEEPING OVER A PEAL OF LAUGHTER GREETED HIM AND HAVING GOT THE BETTER OF HIS MASTER IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE HE MADE THE MOST OF THE ADVANTAGE BY PLAYFULLY WORRYING HIM AS HE KEPT HIM DOWN
BEFORE BEN COULD QUIET HIM BAB CAME CLIMBING UP THE BANK WITH SUCH A FUNNY MIXTURE OF FEAR FATIGUE DETERMINATION AND RELIEF IN HER DIRTY LITTLE FACE
AND SAM TRIED AGAIN WHILE BEN WAS GETTING THE DOG DOWN AND SITTING ON HIM NOW YOU EXPECT TO GO TO THE CIRCUS I SUPPOSE COURSE I DO BEN SAID HE DIDN'T MIND PAYING IF I COULD GET THERE WITHOUT BOTHERING HIM AND I HAVE
AND BOUND TO DO THE HANDSOME THING BY HIS PERSISTENT FRIEND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD AND BAB FOLDED HER ARMS AS IF SHE HAD NOTHING FURTHER TO DO BUT ENJOY HERSELF ARE YOU HUNGRY ASKED BILLY
IN A SWAMPY PLACE COMING ALONG SANCH SAW SOMETHING DOWN THERE AND I WENT WITH HIM CAUSE I THOUGHT MAY BE IT WAS A MUSK RAT AND YOU'D LIKE ONE IF WE COULD GET HIM
AND I WAS IN HASTE TO BE OFF AND GET MYSELF ESTABLISHED SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDST OF IT WHETHER THE SUMMIT WAS TO BE ATTAINED OR NOT SISSON WHO IS A MOUNTAINEER SPEEDILY FITTED ME OUT FOR STORM OR CALM AS ONLY A MOUNTAINEER COULD
THEY ALL ESCAPED TO THE SIDE OF A RIDGE ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE TIMBERLINE TO GO FARTHER WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION SO WE WERE COMPELLED TO CAMP AS BEST WE COULD A PITCH PINE FIRE SPEEDILY CHANGED THE TEMPERATURE
AND SHED A BLAZE OF LIGHT ON THE WILD LAVA SLOPE AND THE STRAGGLING STORM BENT PINES AROUND US MELTED SNOW ANSWERED FOR COFFEE AND WE HAD PLENTY OF VENISON TO ROAST TOWARD MIDNIGHT I ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS SLEPT AN HOUR AND A HALF
FELL AWAY FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE IN FLOWING FOLDS MORE EXTENSIVE AND CONTINUOUS THAN ANY I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE WHEN DAY DAWNED THE CLOUDS WERE CRAWLING SLOWLY AND BECOMING MORE MASSIVE BUT GAVE NO INTIMATION OF IMMEDIATE DANGER
DARKENING THE AIR AS THEY PASSED AND PRODUCING A CHILL AS DEFINITE AND SUDDEN AS IF ICE WATER HAD BEEN DASHED IN MY FACE THIS IS THE KIND OF CLOUD IN WHICH SNOW FLOWERS GROW AND I TURNED AND FLED
I REACHED CAMP ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE DUSK HOLLOWED A STRIP OF LOOSE GROUND IN THE LEE OF A LARGE BLOCK OF RED LAVA WHERE FIREWOOD WAS ABUNDANT ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS AND WENT TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING
I WAS EXULTINGLY READY TO WELCOME THEM MOST OF MY FIREWOOD WAS MORE THAN HALF ROSIN AND WOULD BLAZE IN THE FACE OF THE FIERCEST DRIFTING THE WINDS COULD NOT DEMOLISH MY BED AND MY BREAD COULD BE MADE TO LAST INDEFINITELY
AND THE PASSIONATE UPROAR PRODUCED A GLAD EXCITEMENT DAY AFTER DAY THE STORM CONTINUED PILING SNOW ON SNOW IN WEARILESS ABUNDANCE
AND HE MUST SURELY HAVE PERISHED AND SISSON WAS BLAMED FOR ALLOWING ANY ONE TO ATTEMPT CLIMBING IN SUCH WEATHER WHILE I WAS AS SAFE AS ANYBODY IN THE LOWLANDS LYING LIKE A SQUIRREL IN A WARM FLUFFY NEST BUSIED ABOUT MY OWN AFFAIRS AND WISHING ONLY TO BE LET ALONE
AND OUR GLORIOUS MORNING IN THE SKY PROMISED NOTHING BUT ENJOYMENT AT NINE A M THE DRY THERMOMETER STOOD AT THIRTY FOUR DEGREES IN THE SHADE AND ROSE STEADILY UNTIL AT ONE P M IT STOOD AT FIFTY DEGREES
IN THE MEAN TIME CLOUDS WERE GROWING DOWN IN SHASTA VALLEY MASSIVE SWELLING CUMULI DISPLAYING DELICIOUS TONES OF PURPLE AND GRAY IN THE HOLLOWS OF THEIR SUN BEATEN BOSSES EXTENDING GRADUALLY SOUTHWARD AROUND ON BOTH SIDES OF SHASTA
THE CREATIVE SUN SHONE GLORIOUS ON THE VAST EXPANSE OF CLOUDLAND HILL AND DALE MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY SPRINGING INTO EXISTENCE RESPONSIVE TO HIS RAYS AND STEADILY DEVELOPING IN BEAUTY AND INDIVIDUALITY
THEN SAILING OUT INTO THE THIN AZURE OVER THE PRECIPITOUS BRINK OF THE RIDGE THEY WERE DRIFTED TOGETHER LIKE WREATHS OF FOAM ON A RIVER THESE HIGHER AND FINER CLOUD FABRICS
STROKE FOLLOWING STROKE IN QUICK PASSIONATE SUCCESSION AS THOUGH THE MOUNTAIN WERE BEING RENT TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND THE FIRES OF THE OLD VOLCANO WERE BREAKING FORTH AGAIN COULD WE AT ONCE HAVE BEGUN TO DESCEND THE SNOW SLOPES LEADING TO THE TIMBER
TO LET JEROME WHO HAD FALLEN A LITTLE BEHIND COME UP HERE HE OPENED A COUNCIL IN WHICH UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EXCITING BUT WITHOUT EVINCING ANY BEWILDERMENT HE MAINTAINED IN OPPOSITION TO MY VIEWS THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED
HE FIRMLY REFUSED TO MAKE THE VENTURE TO FIND THE CAMP WHILE I AWARE OF THE DANGERS THAT WOULD NECESSARILY ATTEND OUR EFFORTS AND CONSCIOUS OF BEING THE CAUSE OF HIS PRESENT PERIL DECIDED NOT TO LEAVE HIM OUR DISCUSSIONS ENDED
AFTER WAITING AND WATCHING IN VAIN FOR SOME FLAW IN THE STORM THAT MIGHT BE URGED AS A NEW ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF ATTEMPTING THE DESCENT I WAS COMPELLED TO FOLLOW HERE SAID JEROME AS WE SHIVERED IN THE MIDST OF THE HISSING SPUTTERING FUMAROLES
BUT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS FOR THE SCALDING GAS JETS WERE SHORN OFF CLOSE TO THE GROUND BY THE OVERSWEEPING FLOOD OF FROSTY WIND AND HOW LAVISHLY THE SNOW FELL ONLY MOUNTAINEERS MAY KNOW THE CRISP CRYSTAL FLOWERS
SEEMED TO TOUCH ONE ANOTHER AND FAIRLY TO THICKEN THE TREMENDOUS BLAST THAT CARRIED THEM THIS WAS THE BLOOM TIME THE SUMMER OF THE CLOUD AND NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN EVEN A MOUNTAIN CLOUD FLOWERING SO PROFUSELY
A WEAVING OF TRANSLUCENT TISSUE ABOVE THEN THE ROAR OF THE WIND AND THE THUNDER AND THE DARKENING FLIGHT OF SNOW ITS SUBSIDENCE WAS NOT LESS SUDDEN THE CLOUDS BROKE AND VANISHED NOT A CRYSTAL WAS LEFT IN THE SKY
STILL THE PAIN WAS NOT ALWAYS OF THAT BITTER INTENSE KIND THAT PRECLUDES THOUGHT AND TAKES AWAY ALL CAPACITY FOR ENJOYMENT A SORT OF DREAMY STUPOR CAME ON AT TIMES
IN WHICH WE FANCIED WE SAW DRY RESINOUS LOGS SUITABLE FOR CAMPFIRES JUST AS AFTER GOING DAYS WITHOUT FOOD MEN FANCY THEY SEE BREAD FROZEN BLISTERED FAMISHED BENUMBED OUR BODIES SEEMED LOST TO US AT TIMES
THE FROST GREW MORE AND MORE INTENSE AND WE BECAME ICY AND COVERED OVER WITH A CRUST OF FROZEN SNOW
WERE MARSHALING THEMSELVES ALONG THE MOUNTAIN TOPS AND SENDING OUT LONG OVERLAPPING WINGS ACROSS THE VALLEY AND EVEN WHERE NO CLOUD WAS VISIBLE AN OBSCURING FILM ABSORBED THE SUNLIGHT GIVING RISE TO A COLD BLUISH DARKNESS NEVERTHELESS
ADVANCING WITH A MOST MAJESTIC FRONT ROLLING AND OVERCOMBING LIKE A GIGANTIC SEA WAVE SCARCELY WAS IT IN PLAIN SIGHT ERE IT WAS UPON US RACING ACROSS THE JORDAN OVER THE CITY
MUST HERE BE EXPOSED TO TERRIBLE TRIALS CITY CREEK COMING FROM ITS HIGH GLACIAL FOUNTAINS ENTERS THE STREETS OF THIS MORMON ZION PURE AS AN ANGEL BUT HOW DOES IT LEAVE IT
TOWARD THE EVENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH IT BEGAN TO WITHER THE SNOWY SKIRTS OF THE WAHSATCH MOUNTAINS APPEARED BENEATH THE LIFTING FRINGES OF THE CLOUDS AND THE SUN SHONE OUT THROUGH COLORED WINDOWS PRODUCING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS AFTER STORM EFFECTS I EVER WITNESSED
AND WHEN THESE SEDIMENTS BECAME DRY LAND AND WERE BAKED AND CRUMBLED INTO THE SKY AS MOUNTAIN RANGES WHEN THE LAVA FLOODS OF THE FIRE PERIOD WERE BEING LAVISHLY POURED FORTH FROM INNUMERABLE RIFTS AND CRATERS
AFTER CAREFULLY SCANNING THE JAGGED TOWERS AND BATTLEMENTS WITH WHICH IT IS ROUGHENED I DETERMINED TO MAKE IT MY WAY THOUGH IT PRESENTED BUT A FEEBLE ADVERTISEMENT OF ITS FLORAL WEALTH THIS APPARENT BARRENNESS HOWEVER MADE NO GREAT OBJECTION JUST THEN
NEVER BEFORE IN ALL MY WALKS HAVE I MET SO GLORIOUS A THRONG OF THESE FINE SHOWY LILIACEOUS PLANTS THE WHOLE MOUNTAINSIDE WAS AGLOW WITH THEM FROM A HEIGHT OF FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE SNOW
THE FLY CATCHER THE WALKING FERN ET CETERA I HARDLY KNOW HOW THE LITTLE BELLS I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING WOULD BE REGARDED BY SEEKERS OF THIS CLASS BUT EVERY TRUE FLOWER LOVER WHO COMES TO CONSIDER THESE UTAH LILIES WILL SURELY BE WELL REWARDED HOWEVER LONG THE WAY
I FOUND HUNDREDS OF THEM IN FULL BLOOM WITHIN TWO FEET OF THE SNOW IN WINTER ONLY THE BULBS ARE ALIVE SLEEPING DEEP BENEATH THE GROUND LIKE FIELD MICE IN THEIR NESTS THEN THE SNOW FLOWERS FALL ABOVE THEM LILIES OVER LILIES
AND THREE OR FOUR HANDSOME ALLIUMS ONE OF THESE LILIES THE CALOCHORTUS SEVERAL SPECIES OF WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN IN CALIFORNIA AS THE MARIPOSA TULIPS HAS RECEIVED GREAT CONSIDERATION AT THE HANDS OF THE MORMONS
HERE I FEEL UNEASY ABOUT THE NAME OF THIS LILY FOR THE COMPOSITORS HAVE A PERVERSE TRICK OF MAKING ME SAY ALL KINDS OF ABSURD THINGS WHOLLY UNWARRANTED BY PLAIN COPY AND I FEAR THAT THE LILY OF SAN PITCH WILL APPEAR IN PRINT AS THE WIDOW OF SAM PATCH
AS ONE STROLLS IN THE WOODS ABOUT THE LOGGING CAMPS MOST OF THE LUMBERMEN ARE FOUND TO BE INTERESTING PEOPLE TO MEET KIND AND OBLIGING AND SINCERE FULL OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE BARK AND SAPWOOD AND HEARTWOOD OF THE TREES THEY CUT AND HOW TO FELL THEM WITHOUT UNNECESSARY BREAKAGE
A VERY DIFFERENT MAN SEEN NOW AND THEN AT LONG INTERVALS BUT USUALLY INVISIBLE IS THE FREE ROAMER OF THE WILDERNESS HUNTER PROSPECTOR EXPLORER SEEKING HE KNOWS NOT WHAT LITHE AND SINEWY HE WALKS ERECT
THEREFORE HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND HIGH THE BRAG ASCENDING FROM PUGET SOUND IN MOST CASES IT IS LIKELY TO APPEAR PARDONABLE AND MORE SEATTLE WAS NAMED AFTER AN OLD INDIAN CHIEF WHO LIVED IN THIS PART OF THE SOUND
HALF PRAIRIE LEVEL AND FERTILE AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSIFIED WITH OUTSTANDING GROVES OF SPRUCES AND ALDERS AND RICH FLOWERY FRINGES OF SPIRAEA AND WILD ROSES THE RIVER MEANDERING DEEP AND TRANQUIL THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
STILL MORE STRIKING ARE THEIR QUEER CAMPS ON THE EDGES OF THE FIELDS OR OVER ON THE RIVER BANK WITH THE FIRELIGHT SHINING ON THEIR WILD JOLLY FACES BUT WOE TO THE RANCH SHOULD FIRE WATER GET THERE BUT THE CHIEF ATTRACTIONS HERE ARE NOT FOUND IN THE HOPS
THE POOL IS OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH AS IS SHOWN BY THE RADIATING WELL BEATEN FOAM AND MIST WHICH IS OF A BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR AT TIMES OF EXQUISITE FINENESS OF TONE AND BY THE HEAVY WAVES THAT LASH THE ROCKS IN FRONT OF IT
IN OR NEAR THE THROAT FELL DOWN DEAD WHEREAT THE INDIANS SCORNFULLY SHOUTED AND HALLOWED AND WERE PRESENTLY UPON HIM STRIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES THE BULLETS FLYING THICK ONE WENT THROUGH MY SIDE AND THE SAME AS WOULD SEEM
AND HER ELDER SON TELLING HER THAT HER SON WILLIAM WAS DEAD AND MYSELF WAS WOUNDED SHE SAID AND LORD LET ME DIE WITH THEM WHICH WAS NO SOONER SAID BUT SHE WAS STRUCK WITH A BULLET AND FELL DOWN DEAD OVER THE THRESHOLD
I ASKED THEM WHETHER I MIGHT NOT LODGE IN THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED WHAT WILL YOU LOVE ENGLISH MEN STILL THIS WAS THE DOLEFULEST NIGHT THAT EVER MY EYES SAW OH THE ROARING AND SINGING AND DANCING AND YELLING OF THOSE BLACK CREATURES IN THE NIGHT
AND CARRIED IT IN MY ARMS TILL MY STRENGTH FAILED AND I FELL DOWN WITH IT THEN THEY SET ME UPON A HORSE WITH MY WOUNDED CHILD IN MY LAP AND THERE BEING NO FURNITURE UPON THE HORSE'S BACK AS WE WERE GOING DOWN A STEEP HILL WE BOTH FELL OVER THE HORSE'S HEAD
AND WE WERE BOTH ALIVE TO SEE THE LIGHT OF THE NEXT MORNING THE THIRD REMOVE
BY MY MASTER IN THIS WRITING MUST BE UNDERSTOOD QUINNAPIN WHO WAS A SAGAMORE AND MARRIED KING PHILIP'S WIFE'S SISTER NOT THAT HE FIRST TOOK ME BUT I WAS SOLD TO HIM BY ANOTHER NARRAGANSETT INDIAN WHO TOOK ME WHEN FIRST I CAME OUT OF THE GARRISON
SHE WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD AND TAKEN FROM THE DOOR AT FIRST BY A PRAYING INDIANA AND AFTERWARD SOLD FOR A GUN
I HAD NOT SEEN HIM BEFORE SINCE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TOWN AND I KNEW NOT WHERE HE WAS TILL I WAS INFORMED BY HIMSELF THAT HE WAS AMONGST A SMALLER PARCEL OF INDIANS WHOSE PLACE WAS ABOUT SIX MILES OFF WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES HE ASKED ME WHETHER HIS SISTER SARAH WAS DEAD
AND TOLD ME HE HAD SEEN HIS SISTER MARY AND PRAYED ME THAT I WOULD NOT BE TROUBLED IN REFERENCE TO HIMSELF THE OCCASION OF HIS COMING TO SEE ME AT THIS TIME WAS THIS THERE WAS AS I SAID ABOUT SIX MILES FROM US A SMALL PLANTATION OF INDIANS WHERE IT SEEMS HE HAD BEEN DURING HIS CAPTIVITY
BY THEIR NOISE AND HOOPING THEY SIGNIFIED HOW MANY THEY HAD DESTROYED WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME TWENTY THREE
I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE OF THE WONDERFUL MERCY OF GOD TO ME IN THOSE AFFLICTIONS IN SENDING ME A BIBLE ONE OF THE INDIANS THAT CAME FROM MEDFIELD FIGHT HAD BROUGHT SOME PLUNDER CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME IF I WOULD HAVE A BIBLE HE HAD GOT ONE IN HIS BASKET
THEY BEING TO GO ONE WAY AND I ANOTHER I ASKED THEM WHETHER THEY WERE EARNEST WITH GOD FOR DELIVERANCE THEY TOLD ME THEY DID AS THEY WERE ABLE AND IT WAS SOME COMFORT TO ME THAT THE LORD STIRRED UP CHILDREN TO LOOK TO HIM
SOME CARRIED ONE AND SOME ANOTHER FOUR OF THEM CARRIED A GREAT INDIAN UPON A BIER BUT GOING THROUGH A THICK WOOD WITH HIM THEY WERE HINDERED AND COULD MAKE NO HASTE WHEREUPON THEY TOOK HIM UPON THEIR BACKS AND CARRIED HIM ONE AT A TIME TILL
AND WERE GATHERED TOGETHER I THOUGHT TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF THEM BUT THEY WERE SO MANY AND BEING SOMEWHAT IN MOTION IT WAS BEYOND MY SKILL IN THIS TRAVEL BECAUSE OF MY WOUND I WAS SOMEWHAT FAVORED IN MY LOAD I CARRIED ONLY MY KNITTING WORK AND TWO QUARTS OF PARCHED MEAL
BEING VERY FAINT I ASKED MY MISTRESS TO GIVE ME ONE SPOONFUL OF THE MEAL BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE ME A TASTE THEY QUICKLY FELL TO CUTTING DRY TREES TO MAKE RAFTS TO CARRY THEM OVER THE RIVER AND SOON MY TURN CAME TO GO OVER BY THE ADVANTAGE OF SOME BRUSH
WHICH THEY HAD LAID UPON THE RAFT TO SIT UPON I DID NOT WET MY FOOT WHICH MANY OF THEMSELVES AT THE OTHER END WERE MID LEG DEEP WHICH CANNOT BUT BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A FAVOR OF GOD TO MY WEAKENED BODY IT BEING A VERY COLD TIME I WAS NOT BEFORE ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH
THEY WERE MANY HUNDREDS OLD AND YOUNG SOME SICK AND SOME LAME MANY HAD PAPOOSES AT THEIR BACKS THE GREATEST NUMBER AT THIS TIME WITH US WERE SQUAWS
IF WE HAD BEEN GOD WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT A WAY FOR THE ENGLISH TO HAVE PASSED THIS RIVER AS WELL AS FOR THE INDIANS WITH THEIR SQUAWS AND CHILDREN AND ALL THEIR LUGGAGE OH THAT MY PEOPLE HAD HEARKENED TO ME AND ISRAEL HAD WALKED IN MY WAYS
THEY SET THEIR WIGWAMS ON FIRE AND WENT AWAY IT WAS A COLD MORNING AND BEFORE US THERE WAS A GREAT BROOK WITH ICE ON IT SOME WADED THROUGH IT UP TO THE KNEES AND HIGHER BUT OTHERS WENT TILL THEY CAME TO A BEAVER DAM AND I AMONGST THEM
AND THE CHANGE THAT HAD COME UPON US WE HAD HUSBAND AND FATHER AND CHILDREN AND SISTERS AND FRIENDS AND RELATIONS AND HOUSE AND HOME AND MANY COMFORTS OF THIS LIFE BUT NOW WE MAY SAY AS JOB
I PRAY GOD HE MAY REMEMBER THESE THINGS NOW HE IS RETURNED IN SAFETY AT THIS PLACE THE SUN NOW GETTING HIGHER WHAT WITH THE BEAMS AND HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE SMOKE OF THE WIGWAMS I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLIND
I TURNED HOMEWARD AGAIN AND MET WITH MY MASTER HE SHOWED ME THE WAY TO MY SON WHEN I CAME TO HIM I FOUND HIM NOT WELL AND WITHALL HE HAD A BOIL ON HIS SIDE WHICH MUCH TROUBLED HIM WE BEMOANED ONE ANOTHER A WHILE AS THE LORD HELPED US
FOR FEAR THEY WOULD GET IT FROM ME AND THERE IT LAY ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT IN MY STINKING POCKET
AND PUT IT INTO MY POCKET AND NEVER LET HER SEE IT AFTERWARD THEN THEY PACKED UP THEIR THINGS TO BE GONE AND GAVE ME MY LOAD I COMPLAINED IT WAS TOO HEAVY WHEREUPON SHE GAVE ME A SLAP IN THE FACE AND BADE ME GO
I LIFTED UP MY HEART TO GOD HOPING THE REDEMPTION WAS NOT FAR OFF AND THE RATHER BECAUSE THEIR INSOLENCY GREW WORSE AND WORSE BUT THE THOUGHTS OF MY GOING HOMEWARD FOR SO WE BENT OUR COURSE
WE WENT IN THE MORNING TO GATHER GROUND NUTS TO THE RIVER AND WENT BACK AGAIN THAT NIGHT I WENT WITH A GOOD LOAD AT MY BACK FOR THEY WHEN THEY WENT THOUGH BUT A LITTLE WAY WOULD CARRY ALL THEIR TRUMPERY WITH THEM I TOLD THEM THE SKIN WAS OFF MY BACK
BUT I HAD NO OTHER COMFORTING ANSWER FROM THEM THAN THIS THAT IT WOULD BE NO MATTER IF MY HEAD WERE OFF TOO THE THIRTEENTH REMOVE INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE BAY WHICH WAS THAT I DESIRED
AS BIG AS HIS TWO FINGERS AND THAT HE WAS VERY GOOD MEAT BUT THE LORD UPHELD MY SPIRIT UNDER THIS DISCOURAGEMENT
BUT WHEN I WAS WITHOUT AND SAW NOTHING BUT WILDERNESS AND WOODS AND A COMPANY OF BARBAROUS HEATHENS MY MIND QUICKLY RETURNED TO ME WHICH MADE ME THINK OF THAT SPOKEN CONCERNING SAMPSON WHO SAID I WILL GO OUT AND SHAKE MYSELF AS AT OTHER TIMES
I HOPED TO BE CARRIED TO ALBANY AS THE INDIANS HAD DISCOURSED BEFORE BUT THAT FAILED ALSO I THOUGHT OF BEING SOLD TO MY HUSBAND
THEY ALL GATHERED ABOUT THE POOR MAN ASKING HIM MANY QUESTIONS I DESIRED ALSO TO GO AND SEE HIM AND WHEN I CAME HE WAS CRYING BITTERLY SUPPOSING THEY WOULD QUICKLY KILL HIM WHEREUPON I ASKED ONE OF THEM WHETHER THEY INTENDED TO KILL HIM HE ANSWERED ME THEY WOULD NOT
I TOLD HER I WOULD TEAR HER COAT THEN WITH THAT MY MISTRESS RISES UP
HE TOLD ME HE WAS VERY SICK OF A FLUX WITH EATING SO MUCH BLOOD THEY HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF THE WIGWAM AND WITH HIM AN INDIAN PAPOOSE ALMOST DEAD WHOSE PARENTS HAD BEEN KILLED
FOR AS THEY WERE ALL VERY ABLE BODIED MEN THEY WOULD BE EXTREMELY USEFUL ON A SHIP BUT WHEN HIS VESSEL WAS SAFELY MOORED AND IT BECAME KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT HE HAD A COMPANY OF PIRATES ON BOARD
AND WHO HAD HEARD OF HIS VARIOUS EXPLOITS HE THEREFORE WENT TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE VESSEL AND INFORMED HIM THAT HE HAD ON BOARD ONE OF THE VERY WORST PIRATES IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHOSE WICKED DEEDS WERE WELL KNOWN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WEST INDIES
BUT HE DID NOT LOSE HEART AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS IRONS WHICH WERE PROBABLY VERY CLUMSY AFFAIRS AT LAST CARING LITTLE HOW MUCH HE SCRATCHED AND TORE HIS SKIN
THERE WAS A FIERCE STRUGGLE BUT THE PIRATE WAS QUICK AND POWERFUL AND THE SENTINEL WAS SOON DEAD THEN CARRYING HIS TWO JARS BARTHOLEMY CLIMBED SWIFTLY AND NOISELESSLY UP THE SHORT LADDER
FOR A MOMENT HE SANK BELOW THE SURFACE BUT THE TWO AIR TIGHT JARS QUICKLY ROSE AND BORE HIM UP WITH THEM THERE WAS A BUSTLE ON BOARD THE SHIP THERE WAS SOME RANDOM FIRING OF MUSKETS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPLASHING WHICH THE WATCH HAD HEARD
BUT NONE OF THE BALLS STRUCK THE PIRATE OR HIS JARS AND HE SOON FLOATED OUT OF SIGHT AND HEARING KICKING OUT WITH HIS LEGS AND PADDLING AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE HELD ON TO THE JARS WITH THE OTHER HE AT LAST MANAGED TO REACH THE LAND
WHICH WAS WHAT HE WISHED TO DO IF THE HOUNDS SHOULD GET UPON HIS TRAIL HE WAS A LOST MAN THE DESPERATE PIRATE THEREFORE DETERMINED TO GIVE THE BLOODHOUNDS NO CHANCE TO FOLLOW HIM AND FOR THREE DAYS HE REMAINED IN A MARSHY FOREST IN THE DARK RECESSES OF WHICH HE COULD HIDE
AND SOMETIMES HE SAW AT NIGHT DISTANT TORCHES WHICH HE WAS SURE WERE CARRIED BY MEN WHO WERE HUNTING FOR HIM BUT AT LAST THE PURSUIT SEEMED TO BE GIVEN UP AND HEARING NO MORE DOGS AND SEEING NO MORE FLICKERING LIGHTS BARTHOLEMY LEFT THE MARSH AND SET OUT ON HIS LONG JOURNEY DOWN THE COAST
ALTHOUGH HE COULD HEAR THE ROARS AND SCREAMS OF WILD BEASTS ALL ABOUT HIM ANY ONE WHO IS AFRAID TO GO DOWN INTO A DARK CELLAR TO GET SOME APPLES FROM A BARREL AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS CAN HAVE NO IDEA OF THE SORT OF MIND POSSESSED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ
THE ANIMALS MIGHT HOWL AROUND HIM AND GLARE AT HIM WITH THEIR SHINING EYES AND THE ALLIGATORS MIGHT LASH THE WATER INTO FOAM WITH THEIR GREAT TAILS
AND HE HAD NO WINE JARS NOW WITH WHICH TO BUOY HIMSELF UP
HERE WAS A NICE LITTLE PRIZE THAT COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM HIM AND L'OLONNOIS HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE HIS PREPARATIONS TO SEIZE IT AS HE COULD NOT SAIL A SHIP DIRECTLY UP TO THE TOWN
INFORMING THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND THAT THE CRUEL PIRATE L'OLONNOIS WAS IN A SHIP A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THEIR VILLAGE WHICH HE UNDOUBTEDLY INTENDED TO ATTACK WHEN THE GOVERNOR HEARD THIS ASTONISHING TALE
IF THEY MET AN ENEMY WHO WAS WEAK THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM AND IF THEY MET WITH ONE WHO WAS A GOOD DEAL STRONGER THAN THEMSELVES THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM ALL THE SAME WHEN THE TIME CAME TO FIGHT THEY FOUGHT
FOR AS HAS BEEN SAID SUCH VESSELS WERE CONTINUALLY PLYING ABOUT THOSE SHALLOW WATERS THE CANOES WERE HAILED AND AFTER HAVING GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF THEMSELVES THEY WERE ASKED IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIRATE SHIP UPON THE COAST
ONE CANOE ATTACKING HER ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER ON THE OTHER BEFORE THE SPANISH COULD COMPREHEND WHAT HAD HAPPENED THERE WERE MORE THAN TWENTY PIRATES UPON THEIR DECKS THE DREADED L'OLONNOIS AT THEIR HEAD
L'OLONNOIS NOW STOOD A PROUD VICTOR ON THE DECK OF HIS PRIZE AND BEING A MAN OF PRINCIPLE HE DETERMINED TO LIVE UP TO THE DISTINGUISHED REPUTATION WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD
HE WISHED TO GIVE SPAIN A LESSON WHICH WOULD MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE INTERFERED WITH IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS ENTERPRISES AND HE DETERMINED TO ALLOW HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF PERSONALLY TEACHING THIS LESSON
AND THAT UNLESS HE WISHED TO BRING UPON THEM TROUBLES GREATER THAN THOSE OF FAMINE OR PESTILENCE THEY BEGGED THAT HE WOULD RETRACT HIS OATH WHEN THE HIGH DIGNITARY HAD COOLED DOWN A LITTLE HE SAW THAT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF SENSE IN WHAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE HAD SAID TO HIM
STORIES OF DISASTER WERE BORNE INTO THEIR MINDS WITH MANY PROOFS THIS DIN OF MUSKETRY ON THE RIGHT GROWING LIKE A RELEASED GENIE OF SOUND EXPRESSED AND EMPHASIZED THE ARMY'S PLIGHT THE MEN WERE DISHEARTENED AND BEGAN TO MUTTER
OBSERVED A MAN HIS FRIEND RECENTLY AROUSED WAS STILL VERY DROWSY HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM UNTIL HIS MIND TOOK IN THE MEANING OF THE MOVEMENT THEN HE SIGHED OH WELL I S'POSE WE GOT LICKED
BUT STILL STILL WE DON'T HAVE NO LUCK WELL THEN IF WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL AN DON'T EVER WHIP IT MUST BE THE GENERAL'S FAULT SAID THE YOUTH GRANDLY AND DECISIVELY
HE BECAME SUDDENLY A MODEST PERSON THERE WAS LOW TONED TALK AMONG THE TROOPS THE OFFICERS WERE IMPATIENT AND SNAPPY THEIR COUNTENANCES CLOUDED WITH THE TALES OF MISFORTUNE
THE TROOPS SIFTING THROUGH THE FOREST WERE SULLEN IN THE YOUTH'S COMPANY ONCE A MAN'S LAUGH RANG OUT A DOZEN SOLDIERS TURNED THEIR FACES QUICKLY TOWARD HIM AND FROWNED WITH VAGUE DISPLEASURE
IN A CLEAR SPACE THE TROOPS WERE AT LAST HALTED REGIMENTS AND BRIGADES BROKEN AND DETACHED THROUGH THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THICKETS GREW TOGETHER AGAIN AND LINES WERE FACED TOWARD THE PURSUING BARK OF THE ENEMY'S INFANTRY
INCREASED TO A LOUD AND JOYOUS BURST AND THEN AS THE SUN WENT SERENELY UP THE SKY THROWING ILLUMINATING RAYS INTO THE GLOOMY THICKETS IT BROKE FORTH INTO PROLONGED PEALINGS THE WOODS BEGAN TO CRACKLE AS IF AFIRE
AWAITED THE MOMENT WHEN THE GRAY SHADOWS OF THE WOODS BEFORE THEM SHOULD BE SLASHED BY THE LINES OF FLAME THERE WAS MUCH GROWLING AND SWEARING GOOD GAWD THE YOUTH GRUMBLED WE'RE ALWAYS BEING CHASED AROUND LIKE RATS IT MAKES ME SICK
AND THEN WE BEGIN TO FIGHT AND THE REBS HAD AN EASY TIME OF IT DON'T TELL ME IT'S JUST LUCK I KNOW BETTER IT'S THIS DERNED OLD THE FRIEND SEEMED JADED BUT HE INTERRUPTED HIS COMRADE WITH A VOICE OF CALM CONFIDENCE
LESS TALKIN AN MORE FIGHTIN IS WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU BOYS I NEVER SAW SECH GABBLING JACKASSES HE PAUSED READY TO POUNCE UPON ANY MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE THE TEMERITY TO REPLY
AND THEY WERE EXTREMELY SORRY ABOUT THE MATTER I WISH THE DEUCE NICHOLAS REMEMBER YOU ARE NO LONGER STANDING BEHIND THE COUNTER WHAT AM I TO SAY THEN IF I LOSE MY TEMPER ONE DOESN'T LOSE ONE'S TEMPER ONE GETS ANNOYED
VEX YOU OLD MAN YOU EXPECT ME TO KEEP MY VEXATIONS TO MYSELF BUT YOU LIE LAY OLD GIRL I SAY LIE YOUR BURDENS ON MY SHOULDERS TOO WAS THAT WHAT YOU PROMISED ME WHEN WE GOT MARRIED
IS THAT SO YES AND THEY WERE IMPERTINENT ENOUGH TO SAY THAT I HAD NO LONGER ANY REASON TO BE STUCK UP PROUD OLD GIRL THEY SAID STUCK UP PERSONALLY I SHOULD NEVER HAVE CONDESCENDED
IS YOUR MOTHER PROUD IS SHE EASILY HURT I'M ALWAYS SO AFRAID OF HURTING PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AS YOU KNOW YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME ABOUT HER WEAK POINTS SO THAT I CAN TAKE CARE YOU ASK ME WHETHER SHE IS PROUD
THE NEW LAW SHOULD READ LIKE THIS WHEN A WOMAN MARRIES SHE BECOMES THE OWNER OF HALF HER HUSBAND'S PROPERTY AND OF THIS HALF SHE CAN DISPOSE AS SHE LIKES AND WHEN SHE HAS RUN THROUGH IT THE HUSBAND WILL HAVE TO KEEP HER
WHICH BANK DO YOU PREFER I HAVE BILLS ON ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE IN SPITE OF THE GRAVE CHARACTER OF THE SITUATION FALK COULD NOT HELP SMILING AS HE LOOKED AT THE INCOMPLETE GUARANTEES ON WHICH THE NAME WAS MISSING
THEN YOU TAKE THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE PRINTERS AND THEN WE'LL KICK HIM OUT IF YOU LIKE TO CALL IT THAT I HAVE NO OBJECTION AND AM I TO READ THE VERSES TO YOUR GUESTS AND DISTRIBUTE THEM
SPREADING NETS FOR HAMLET AT POLONIUS'S ADVICE HE ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE AWAY THE THOUGHT AND INSTEAD OF AGNES HE SAW THE COQUETTISH MISS JACQUETTE WHO HAD BEEN THE LAST TO PLAY THE PART AT THE MUNICIPAL THEATRE
HE TRIED IN VAIN TO DRIVE AWAY THESE DISAGREEABLE FANCIES THEY FOLLOWED HIM LIKE GNATS AT LAST EXHAUSTED WITH THE STRAIN HE FELL ASLEEP BUT ONLY TO SUFFER THE SAME TORMENT IN HIS DREAM HE ROUSED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT BUT SOON DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP AGAIN
WON'T YOU SIT DOWN THERE WAS AN OMINOUS SILENCE AN ANGEL IS PASSING THROUGH THE ROOM SAID AGNES YOU SAID REHNHJELM RESPECTFULLY AND ARDENTLY KISSING HER HAND FALANDER LOOKED AS IF HE HAD BEEN THROWN OUT OF HIS SADDLE
A MAN ON THE OTHER HAND THAT IS THE MOST INFAMOUS STATEMENT I EVER HEARD BURST OUT FALANDER HE ROSE WENT TO HIS WRITING DESK THREW OPEN THE FLAP AND TOOK OUT A BLACK BOX HERE HE SAID HANDING IT TO AGNES
LOCK IT UP SHE SAID THIS IS NO TOY MY FRIENDS REHNHJELM HAD WATCHED THE SCENE SPEECHLESSLY HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING WELL ENOUGH BUT HE WAS UNABLE TO SAY A WORD AND HE WAS SO MUCH UNDER THE GIRL'S SPELL THAT HE COULD NOT EVEN FEEL ANGRY WITH HER
HADN'T WE BETTER GO NOW ASKED AGNES STRAIGHTENING HER HAT BEFORE THE GLASS FALANDER OPENED THE DOOR GO AND BE DAMNED TO YOU HE SAID YOU HAVE RUINED AN HONEST MAN'S PEACE OF MIND WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT SHUT THE DOOR IT'S NONE TOO WARM HERE
WITH ITS ROTTEN FLOOR AND LEAKING ROOF THE LATTER DEFECT WAS NOT FELT AT PRESENT
WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THE PURCHASE OF FUEL THE ONLY PIECE OF FURNITURE WAS A WOODEN GARDEN SEAT STUDDED WITH PROTRUDING NAILS IT WAS SO SHORT THAT A MAN USING IT AS A BED
HAD EITHER TO DRAW HIS KNEES UP TO HIS CHIN OR ALLOW HIS LEGS TO DANGLE OVER THE SIDE THE BEDDING CONSISTED OF HALF A RUG THE OTHER HALF WAS AT THE PAWNBROKER'S AND A LEATHER CASE STUFFED TO BURSTING POINT WITH STUDIES AND SKETCHES
I SAW A GREAT MANY CHATTERERS THIS MORNING THAT MEANS A HARD WINTER YOU TOOK A MORNING STROLL I'VE WALKED ABOUT ALL NIGHT AFTER LEAVING THE RED ROOM AT MIDNIGHT YOU WERE AT THE RED ROOM LAST NIGHT YES AND I MADE TWO NEW ACQUAINTANCES DOCTOR BORG AND A MAN CALLED LEVIN OH

THE LATTER STAGGERED TO THE FIRE LAY DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND CURLED HIMSELF UP LIKE A DOG FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOBODY SPOKE
HOW LIKE EVE'S APPLE DOTH THY BEAUTY GROW IF THY SWEET VIRTUE ANSWER NOT THY SHOW
THE SUMMER'S FLOWER IS TO THE SUMMER SWEET THOUGH TO ITSELF IT ONLY LIVE AND DIE BUT IF THAT FLOWER WITH BASE INFECTION MEET THE BASEST WEED
TAKE HEED DEAR HEART OF THIS LARGE PRIVILEGE
SOME SAY THY GRACE IS YOUTH AND GENTLE SPORT BOTH GRACE AND FAULTS ARE LOV'D OF MORE AND LESS
LIKE WIDOW'D WOMBS AFTER THEIR LORDS DECEASE YET THIS ABUNDANT ISSUE SEEM'D TO ME BUT HOPE OF ORPHANS AND UNFATHER'D FRUIT FOR SUMMER AND HIS PLEASURES WAIT ON THEE
AND THOU AWAY THE VERY BIRDS ARE MUTE OR IF THEY SING TIS WITH SO DULL A CHEER THAT LEAVES LOOK PALE DREADING THE WINTER'S NEAR
MY LOVE'S SWEET FACE SURVEY IF TIME HAVE ANY WRINKLE GRAVEN THERE IF ANY BE A SATIRE TO DECAY
WHICH SHALL ABOVE THAT IDLE RANK REMAIN BEYOND ALL DATE EVEN TO ETERNITY OR AT THE LEAST SO LONG AS BRAIN AND HEART HAVE FACULTY BY NATURE TO SUBSIST
IT SUFFERS NOT IN SMILING POMP NOR FALLS UNDER THE BLOW OF THRALLED DISCONTENT
IF SNOW BE WHITE WHY THEN HER BREASTS ARE DUN IF HAIRS BE WIRES BLACK WIRES GROW ON HER HEAD I HAVE SEEN ROSES DAMASK'D RED AND WHITE
YET WELL I KNOW THAT MUSIC HATH A FAR MORE PLEASING SOUND I GRANT I NEVER SAW A GODDESS GO MY MISTRESS WHEN SHE WALKS TREADS ON THE GROUND
CHAPTER THREE MY ADVENT ON MARS I OPENED MY EYES UPON A STRANGE AND WEIRD LANDSCAPE I KNEW THAT I WAS ON MARS NOT ONCE DID I QUESTION EITHER MY SANITY OR MY WAKEFULNESS
NEITHER DID I I FOUND MYSELF LYING PRONE UPON A BED OF YELLOWISH MOSSLIKE VEGETATION WHICH STRETCHED AROUND ME IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR INTERMINABLE MILES I SEEMED TO BE LYING IN A DEEP
THE IRREGULARITIES OF LOW HILLS IT WAS MIDDAY THE SUN WAS SHINING FULL UPON ME AND THE HEAT OF IT WAS RATHER INTENSE UPON MY NAKED BODY YET NO GREATER
THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUE UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS ON AN ARIZONA DESERT HERE AND THERE WERE SLIGHT OUTCROPPINGS OF QUARTZ BEARING ROCK WHICH GLISTENED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE TO MY LEFT PERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS APPEARED A LOW WALLED ENCLOSURE
MY MUSCLES PERFECTLY ATTUNED AND ACCUSTOMED TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ON EARTH PLAYED THE MISCHIEF WITH ME IN ATTEMPTING FOR THE FIRST TIME TO COPE WITH THE LESSER GRAVITATION AND LOWER AIR PRESSURE ON MARS
IT HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN ME TO SEE THE ROOF OF THE ENCLOSURE WAS OF SOLID GLASS
AND BENEATH THIS WERE SEVERAL HUNDRED LARGE EGGS PERFECTLY ROUND AND SNOWY WHITE THE EGGS WERE NEARLY UNIFORM IN SIZE BEING ABOUT TWO AND ONE HALF FEET IN DIAMETER FIVE OR SIX HAD ALREADY HATCHED
THEIR NOSES WERE BUT LONGITUDINAL SLITS IN THE CENTER OF THEIR FACES MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS THERE WAS NO HAIR ON THEIR BODIES
THESE LATTER ADD A MOST FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE TO AN OTHERWISE FEARSOME AND TERRIBLE COUNTENANCE AS THE LOWER TUSKS CURVE UPWARD TO SHARP POINTS WHICH END ABOUT WHERE THE EYES OF EARTHLY HUMAN BEINGS ARE LOCATED
OF THE LITTLE DEVILS I HAD BEEN WATCHING BUT HOW PUNY AND HARMLESS THEY NOW LOOKED BESIDE THIS HUGE AND TERRIFIC INCARNATION OF HATE OF VENGEANCE AND OF DEATH
OF THE POINT OF THE CHARGING SPEAR CONSEQUENTLY I GAVE A VERY EARTHLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SUPERHUMAN LEAP TO REACH THE TOP OF THE MARTIAN INCUBATOR FOR SUCH I HAD DETERMINED IT MUST BE
HE THEN STOPPED AS THOUGH WAITING FOR MY REPLY PRICKING UP HIS ANTENNAE LIKE EARS AND COCKING HIS STRANGE LOOKING EYES STILL FURTHER TOWARD ME AS THE SILENCE BECAME PAINFUL
I CONCLUDED TO HAZARD A LITTLE CONVERSATION ON MY OWN PART AS I HAD GUESSED THAT HE WAS MAKING OVERTURES OF PEACE THE THROWING DOWN OF HIS WEAPONS AND THE WITHDRAWING OF HIS TROOP BEFORE HIS ADVANCE TOWARD ME
BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THE ACTION WITH WHICH I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED MY WORDS STRETCHING MY HAND TOWARD HIM I ADVANCED AND TOOK THE ARMLET FROM HIS OPEN PALM CLASPING IT ABOUT MY ARM ABOVE THE ELBOW
CHAPTER FOUR A PRISONER WE HAD GONE PERHAPS TEN MILES WHEN THE GROUND BEGAN TO RISE VERY RAPIDLY WE WERE AS I WAS LATER TO LEARN NEARING THE EDGE OF ONE OF MARS LONG DEAD SEAS IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH
MY CAPTOR MERELY STRODE UP TO THE ROSTRUM THE OTHERS MAKING WAY FOR HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE CHIEFTAIN ROSE TO HIS FEET AND UTTERED THE NAME OF MY ESCORT WHO IN TURN HALTED AND REPEATED THE NAME OF THE RULER FOLLOWED BY HIS TITLE
HAD THEIR MISSIONS BEEN PEACEFUL OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE EXCHANGED SHOTS OR HAVE FOUGHT OUT THEIR INTRODUCTION WITH SOME OTHER OF THEIR VARIOUS WEAPONS MY CAPTOR WHOSE NAME WAS TARS TARKAS
IS TO INFLICT DEATH ON THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR IN VARIOUS INGENIOUS AND HORRIBLE WAYS THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS AND CHIEFTAINS EXAMINED ME CLOSELY FEELING MY MUSCLES AND THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN
WHICH THE CHIEFTAIN THEN ORDERED ME TO MAKE BUT I WAS BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND DETERMINED ON THE SPOT THAT MY ONLY METHOD OF SALVATION WAS TO DEMAND THE CONSIDERATION FROM THESE CREATURES
THE AUTHOR IS PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT A SEQUEL TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES THE BOOK WHICH WAS RECEIVED WITH SO MUCH FAVOR LAST YEAR YET IT IS NOT NECESSARY ONE SHOULD HAVE READ THE FIRST BOOK TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT VOLUME
WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN SO FORTUNATE MAY ACQUIRE A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THEM
ARE DRAWN FROM LIFE ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT HAVE THEIR MOUNTAIN LAIR SO NEAR TO TAORMINA AS I HAVE VENTURED TO LOCATE IT EXCEPT THAT I HAVE ADAPTED THEIR CLEVER SYSTEM OF BRIGANDAGE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF THIS STORY THEIR HISTORY IS TRULY RELATED
A CHUBBY LITTLE MAN IN A GRAY SUIT WHOSE FEATURES WERE TEMPORARILY ECLIPSED BY THE NEWSPAPER THAT WAS SPREAD CAREFULLY OVER THEM OCCASIONALLY A GASP OR A SNORE FROM BENEATH THE PAPER SUGGESTED THAT THE LITTLE MAN WAS SNOOZING
AND THEN CARRY IT OUT IN SPITE OF ALL OPPOSITION BUT TO TAKE PATSY TO EUROPE WOULD BE LIKE PULLING THE MAJOR'S EYE TEETH OR AMPUTATING HIS GOOD RIGHT ARM WORSE FAR WORSE IT WOULD MEAN TAKING THE SUNSHINE OUT OF HER OLD FATHER'S SKY ALTOGETHER
THE GRIZZLED OLD IRISHMAN HAD BEEN AS TENDER TOWARD HIM AS A WOMAN AND STUDIOUSLY AVOIDED ANY SPEECH OR EPITHET THAT BY CHANCE MIGHT INJURE THE FEELINGS OF HIS DEAD WIFE'S ONLY BROTHER BUT THE MAJOR'S INVARIABLE COURTESY TO THE POOR OR UNFORTUNATE
AND EUROPE'LL OPEN YOUR EYES AND PROVE TO YOU HOW INSIGNIFICANT YOU REALLY ARE I ADVISE YOU TO VISIT IRELAND SOR WHICH I'M RELIABLY INFORMED IS THE CENTHRAL JEWEL IN EUROPE'S CROWN OF BEAUTY GO
AND MIGHT BE A BIT LONESOME WITHOUT HER BUT I'LL SETTLE THAT FOOLISHNESS SIR IN SHORT ORDER YOU SHALL GO WITH US IMPOSSIBLE EJACULATED THE MAJOR IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR I'M MOST NEEDED IN THE OFFICE
THEN THE MAJOR DREW OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND MOPPED HIS BROW YOU'D LIKE TO GO MAVOURNEEN HE ASKED SOFTLY YES DADDY BUT I WON'T OF COURSE TUT TUT DON'T YOU GO PUTTING YOURSELF AGAINST YOUR OLD FATHER'S WILL PATSY IT'S NOT SO FAR TO EUROPE HE CONTINUED THOUGHTFULLY
HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID UNCLE JOHN I SAY I'VE GOT THREE NIECES AS FINE A TRIO OF INTELLIGENT SWEET AND ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMEN AS YOU'LL RUN ACROSS IN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS I DARE YOU TO DENY IT SIR
WHO NEVER HAD CREDITED HIM WITH SUFFICIENT ABILITY TO EARN MORE THAN A PRECARIOUS LIVELIHOOD BUT THE MAN WAS SHREWD ENOUGH IN A BUSINESS WAY ALTHOUGH SIMPLE ALMOST TO CHILDISHNESS IN MANY OTHER MATTERS WHEN HE RETURNED QUITE UNHERALDED TO END HIS DAYS AT HOME
BY KEEPING BOOKS FOR A MERCANTILE FIRM WHILE PATSY WORKED IN A HAIR DRESSER'S SHOP IT WAS NOW THAT UNCLE JOHN PROVED A MODERN FAIRY GODFATHER TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES WHO WERE LIKEWISE HIS OWN NIECES THE THREE GIRLS HAD LITTLE IN COMMON EXCEPT THEIR POVERTY
MONEY HAD NO POWER TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE DOYLES THE MAJOR REMAINED THE SAME SIMPLE HONEST COURTEOUS YET BRUSQUE OLD WARRIOR WHO HAD WON UNCLE JOHN'S LOVE AS A HARD WORKING BOOK KEEPER
AND NEVER BEFORE HAD AUNT JANE'S THREE NIECES HAD SO MANY ADVANTAGES AND PLEASURES IT WAS TO CONFER STILL FURTHER BENEFITS UPON THESE GIRLS THAT THEIR ECCENTRIC UNCLE HAD PLANNED THIS UNEXPECTED EUROPEAN TRIP HIS TELEGRAM TO ELIZABETH WAS CHARACTERISTIC
AH YES HE RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY I'VE ALWAYS NOTICED THAT THE OPERA MAKES FOLKS DESPERATELY HUNGRY FOR THEY FLOCK TO THE RESTAURANTS AS SOON AS THEY CAN GET AWAY SINGULAR ISN'T IT WHY I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT IN THAT LIGHT
AH YES TO BE SURE SHE MUTTERED PERHAPS THEN IT CAN BE DONE IF LOUISE HAS NO OTHER ENGAGEMENTS JUST WHAT PATSY SAID SEE HERE MARTHA DO YOU IMAGINE THAT ANY GIRL WHO IS HALF HUMAN COULD HAVE ENGAGEMENTS THAT WOULD KEEP HER FROM EUROPE
BUT THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOCIETY YOU'LL GET ME RILED PRETTY SOON MARTHA AND IF YOU DO YOU'LL WISH YOU HADN'T THIS SPEECH FRIGHTENED THE WOMAN IT WOULDN'T DO TO PROVOKE UNCLE JOHN HOWEVER UNREASONABLE HE HAPPENED TO BE SO SHE SAID MEEKLY
THREE BETTER GIRLS NEVER LIVED AND I'LL TRUST EM ANYWHERE BESIDES THAT WE AREN'T GOING TO ANY OF YOUR CONFOUNDED SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WE'RE GOING ON A REG'LAR PICNIC AND IF I DON'T GIVE THOSE GIRLS THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES MY NAME AIN'T JOHN MERRICK
WHY YOU DON'T DARE SAY YOUR SOUL'S YOUR OWN WHEN LOUISE IS AWAKE THAT CHAPERONE BUSINESS IS ALL HUMBUGGERY UNLESS AN OLD UNCLE LIKE ME CAN BE A CHAPERONE ANYHOW I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE APPOINTED I WON'T WAIT FOR LOUISE TO WAKE UP
AFTER ALL SHE SIGHED TAKING UP HER CUP AGAIN IT MAY BE THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR LOUISE WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT YOUNG WELDON WHO IS PAYING HER ATTENTIONS JUST NOW IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS FATHER'S MONEY OR NOT HE'S BEEN A BIT WILD I'VE HEARD
BUT WE MUST MAKE A PROVISION FOR WINTER OR ELSE WE SHALL SUFFER FROM HUNGER SAID THE CAT AND YOU LITTLE MOUSE CANNOT VENTURE EVERYWHERE OR YOU WILL BE CAUGHT IN A TRAP SOME DAY THE GOOD ADVICE WAS FOLLOWED AND A POT OF FAT WAS BOUGHT BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO PUT IT
SO THE POT WAS PLACED IN SAFETY
AND YOU LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE BY YOURSELF YES YES ANSWERED THE MOUSE BY ALL MEANS GO AND IF YOU GET ANYTHING VERY GOOD TO EAT THINK OF ME I SHOULD LIKE A DROP OF SWEET RED CHRISTENING WINE MYSELF ALL THIS HOWEVER WAS UNTRUE
AND THEN STRETCHED HERSELF IN THE SUN AND LICKED HER LIPS WHENEVER SHE THOUGHT OF THE POT OF FAT AND NOT UNTIL IT WAS EVENING DID SHE RETURN HOME WELL HERE YOU ARE AGAIN SAID THE MOUSE NO DOUBT YOU HAVE HAD A MERRY DAY ALL WENT OFF WELL ANSWERED THE CAT
WHEN SHE WENT HOME THE MOUSE INQUIRED AND WHAT WAS THE CHILD CHRISTENED HALF DONE ANSWERED THE CAT HALF DONE
AND WELL FILLED AND FAT SHE DID NOT RETURN HOME TILL NIGHT THE MOUSE AT ONCE ASKED WHAT NAME HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE THIRD CHILD IT WILL NOT PLEASE YOU MORE THAN THE OTHERS SAID THE CAT HE IS CALLED ALL GONE ALL GONE CRIED THE MOUSE
YOU HAVE DEVOURED ALL WHEN YOU WERE STANDING GODMOTHER FIRST TOP OFF THEN HALF DONE THEN WILL YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE CRIED THE CAT
FOR THE MOTHER HAD FALLEN ASLEEP UNDER THE TREE WITH THE CHILD
THROW YOU INTO IT AND BOIL YOU BUT WE WILL GET UP QUICKLY DRESS OURSELVES AND GO AWAY TOGETHER THE TWO CHILDREN THEREFORE GOT UP DRESSED THEMSELVES QUICKLY AND WENT AWAY WHEN THE WATER IN THE KETTLE WAS BOILING
YOU FOOLS WHY DID YOU NOT PULL THE CHURCH TO PIECES AND BRING THE CHANDELIER HOME WITH YOU AND NOW THE OLD COOK HERSELF GOT ON HER LEGS AND WENT WITH THE THREE SERVANTS IN PURSUIT OF THE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN HOWEVER SAW FROM AFAR THAT THE THREE SERVANTS WERE COMING
THE LITTLE PEASANT THERE WAS A CERTAIN VILLAGE WHEREIN NO ONE LIVED BUT REALLY RICH PEASANTS AND JUST ONE POOR ONE WHOM THEY CALLED THE LITTLE PEASANT HE HAD NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS A COW AND STILL LESS MONEY TO BUY ONE
IF YOU CAN STAND THERE AND EAT YOUR FILL YOU CAN ALSO GO ON YOUR FOUR LEGS I DON'T CARE TO DRAG YOU HOME AGAIN IN MY ARMS
OH BUT I MUST HAVE MY BEAST BACK AGAIN THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE MEADOW TOGETHER BUT SOMEONE HAD STOLEN THE CALF AND IT WAS GONE THE COW HERD SAID IT MUST HAVE RUN AWAY THE PEASANT HOWEVER SAID DON'T TELL ME THAT
AND LED THE COW HERD BEFORE THE MAYOR WHO FOR HIS CARELESSNESS CONDEMNED HIM TO GIVE THE PEASANT A COW FOR THE CALF WHICH HAD RUN AWAY AND NOW THE LITTLE PEASANT AND HIS WIFE HAD THE COW FOR WHICH THEY HAD SO LONG WISHED AND THEY WERE HEARTILY GLAD
THE MILLER WOULD HAVE LIKED MUCH TO KNOW THE FIFTH BUT THE LITTLE PEASANT SAID FIRST WE WILL QUICKLY EAT THE FOUR THINGS FOR THE FIFTH IS SOMETHING BAD SO THEY ATE AND AFTER THAT THEY BARGAINED HOW MUCH THE MILLER WAS TO GIVE FOR THE FIFTH PROPHECY
UNTIL THEY AGREED ON THREE HUNDRED TALERS THEN THE PEASANT ONCE MORE PINCHED THE RAVEN'S HEAD TILL HE CROAKED LOUDLY THE MILLER ASKED WHAT DID HE SAY THE PEASANT REPLIED HE SAYS THAT THE DEVIL IS HIDING OUTSIDE THERE IN THE CLOSET ON THE PORCH THE MILLER SAID
I WOULD GET INTO THE BARREL AT ONCE
THEN THE PEASANTS MADE UP THEIR MINDS THAT THEY TOO WOULD FETCH SOME SHEEP FOR THEMSELVES A FLOCK APIECE BUT THE MAYOR SAID I COME FIRST SO THEY WENT TO THE WATER TOGETHER
I KNOW NO WAY IN WHICH A WRITER MAY MORE FITTINGLY INTRODUCE HIS WORK TO THE PUBLIC THAN BY GIVING A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHO AND WHAT HE IS BY THIS MEANS SOME OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE IS VERY PROPERLY SHIFTED TO THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS LIFE
THAT IS INDUCED BY HONEST MANUAL TOIL I WAS EDUCATED AT UPPER CANADA COLLEGE TORONTO OF WHICH I WAS HEAD BOY IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FROM THERE I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO WHERE I GRADUATED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE
AND BY MEANS OF THIS AND SOME TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT BY MC GILL UNIVERSITY I SURVIVED UNTIL I TOOK THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN NINETEEN O THREE THE MEANING OF THIS DEGREE IS THAT THE RECIPIENT OF INSTRUCTION IS EXAMINED FOR THE LAST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND IS PRONOUNCED COMPLETELY FULL
YOU MAY FIND THEM ALL THE WAY FROM LAKE SUPERIOR TO THE SEA WITH THE SAME SQUARE STREETS AND THE SAME MAPLE TREES AND THE SAME CHURCHES AND HOTELS AND EVERYWHERE THE SUNSHINE OF THE LAND OF HOPE SIMILARLY THE REVEREND MISTER DRONE IS NOT ONE PERSON BUT ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
THE RAZOR WOULD GO SLOWER AND SLOWER AND PAUSE AND STOP MOVE AND PAUSE AGAIN TILL THE SHAVE DIED AWAY INTO THE MERE DROWSE OF CONVERSATION AT SUCH HOURS THE MARIPOSA BARBER SHOP WOULD BECOME A VERY PALACE OF SLUMBER
WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
THEY ALL WENT IN OR ALL EXCEPT MISTER SMITH YOU SEE MISTER SMITH HAD COME DOWN FROM THERE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ROCKS AND MINING AND CANOES AND THE NORTH COUNTRY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO EAT FLOUR BAKED DAMPERS UNDER THE LEE SIDE OF A CANOE PROPPED AMONG THE UNDERBRUSH
AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
TO AN ONLOOKER IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM SO SIMPLE I NEVER KNEW THE MEANNESS THE TRICKERY OF THE MINING BUSINESS THE SHEER OBSTINATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIGGER CAPITALISTS NOT TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY MIGHT TILL I HEARD THE ACCOUNTS OF JEFF'S DIFFERENT MINES TAKE THE CASE OF CORONA JEWEL
UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
WITH ONE HAND ON HIS KNEE AND A DOG ONE OF THOSE REGULAR MINING DOGS AT HIS FEET AND A LOOK OF PIERCING INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FACE THAT WOULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I SAY THAT THE RECOGNITION MEANT A LOT TO JEFF FOR ITS OWN SAKE
THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
LOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITE
IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
IN THE INTERIOR OF THIS HALL BARELY LIGHTED BY A CANDLE AT ONE END THE MORTUARY TABLE BEING BEHIND THE POST LIKE A HORIZONTAL BAR
WITH WHY
AND IN ORDER THAT NO ONE MIGHT TOUCH THEM HE HAD THEM PLACED UNDER THE TABLE ON WHICH FATHER MABEUF WAS LYING ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THEY RECKONED UP THEIR STRENGTH THERE WERE STILL THIRTY SEVEN OF THEM
HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON BRUTUS CHEREAS STEPHANUS CROMWELL CHARLOTTE CORDAY SAND HAVE ALL HAD THEIR MOMENT OF AGONY WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE
WHEN MAEVIUS INSULTS VIRGIL WHEN VISE INSULTS MOLIERE WHEN POPE INSULTS SHAKSPEARE WHEN FREDERIC INSULTS VOLTAIRE IT IS AN OLD LAW OF ENVY AND HATRED WHICH IS BEING CARRIED OUT
THAN AS TO THEIR CAUSE MOREOVER SUCCOR WAS EVIDENTLY ON THE WAY TO THEM THEY RECKONED ON IT WITH THAT FACILITY OF TRIUMPHANT PROPHECY WHICH IS ONE OF THE SOURCES OF STRENGTH IN THE FRENCH COMBATANT
IT WAS HAILED WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC ACCLAMATION NO ONE EVER HAS KNOWN THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO SPOKE THUS HE WAS SOME UNKNOWN BLOUSE WEARER A STRANGER
THAT IS DESERTING ONE'S FAMILY AND THOSE WHO HAVE DAUGHTERS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF YOU GET YOURSELVES KILLED YOU ARE DEAD THAT IS WELL AND TOMORROW YOUNG GIRLS WITHOUT BREAD THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING
THOSE ADORABLE AND HONEST CREATURES WHO ARE YOUR BLESSINGS AND YOUR PRIDE AH GOOD GOD THEY WILL SUFFER HUNGER WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO YOU
YOU ARE NO LONGER ON HAND THAT IS WELL YOU HAVE WISHED TO RELEASE THE PEOPLE FROM ROYALTY AND YOU DELIVER OVER YOUR DAUGHTERS TO THE POLICE FRIENDS HAVE A CARE HAVE MERCY
BUT YOUR FAMILIES WILL AND WHAT SUFFERINGS SEE HERE IS A PRETTY HEALTHY CHILD WITH CHEEKS LIKE AN APPLE WHO BABBLES PRATTLES CHATTERS WHO LAUGHS WHO SMELLS SWEET BENEATH YOUR KISS
THAT POOR BRAT I REMEMBER AND I SEEM TO SEE HIM NOW WHEN HE LAY NUDE ON THE DISSECTING TABLE HOW HIS RIBS STOOD OUT ON HIS SKIN LIKE THE GRAVES BENEATH THE GRASS IN A CEMETERY
STRANGE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART AT ITS MOST SUBLIME MOMENTS COMBEFERRE WHO SPOKE THUS WAS NOT AN ORPHAN HE RECALLED THE MOTHERS OF OTHER MEN AND FORGOT HIS OWN
THANKS TO HIS DRESS OF A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN HE HAD MADE HIS WAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE SENTINEL STATIONED BY THE INSURGENTS IN THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD NO OCCASION TO GIVE THE ALARM FOR A SINGLE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
A SORT OF STIFLED FIRE DARTED FROM HIS EYES WHICH WERE FILLED WITH AN INWARD LOOK ALL AT ONCE HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD HIS BLOND LOCKS FELL BACK LIKE THOSE OF AN ANGEL ON THE SOMBRE QUADRIGA MADE OF STARS
PEACE OVER ALL NO MORE BLOODSHED NO MORE WARS HAPPY MOTHERS TO CONQUER MATTER IS THE FIRST STEP TO REALIZE THE IDEAL IS THE SECOND REFLECT ON WHAT PROGRESS HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED
WE ARE ADVANCING TO THE UNITY OF MAN NO MORE FICTIONS NO MORE PARASITES THE REAL GOVERNED BY THE TRUE THAT IS THE GOAL CIVILIZATION WILL HOLD ITS ASSIZES AT THE SUMMIT OF EUROPE
HENCE WHAT IS CALLED THE SOCIAL BOND SOME SAY SOCIAL CONTRACT WHICH IS THE SAME THING THE WORD CONTRACT
AN IDENTICAL SOCIETY WILL SPRING YES INSTRUCTION LIGHT LIGHT EVERYTHING COMES FROM LIGHT AND TO IT EVERYTHING RETURNS CITIZENS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS GREAT BUT THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WILL BE HAPPY
FROM THE FAILURE OF WORK AND THE SCAFFOLD AND THE SWORD AND BATTLES AND THE RUFFIANISM OF CHANCE IN THE FOREST OF EVENTS ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY THERE WILL BE NO MORE EVENTS WE SHALL BE HAPPY
HIS LIPS CONTINUED TO MOVE SILENTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE TALKING TO HIMSELF WHICH CAUSED THEM ALL TO GAZE ATTENTIVELY AT HIM IN THE ENDEAVOR TO HEAR MORE THERE WAS NO APPLAUSE
AND HAD NOT EVEN THE AIR OF HEARING HIM WHEN MARIUS RAISED HIS VOICE TO SAY I KNOW HIM
BOTH EQUIVOCAL AND IMPOSING MOREOVER IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE HE HAD SEEN HIM
THEY ADDED TO THE SYSTEM OF LIGATURES WHICH RENDERED EVERY ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE THAT SORT OF BOND WHICH IS CALLED IN PRISONS A MARTINGALE WHICH STARTING AT THE NECK
WHICH SHE HAD NOT YET DONE UP TO THAT TIME SHE HAD CONTENTED HERSELF WITH WATCHING HIM ON HIS PASSAGE ALONG THE BOULEVARD WITHOUT EVER SEEKING TO ENCOUNTER HIM IT WAS ONLY ON THE EVENING BEFORE THAT SHE HAD ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS HIM
AN OLD BELATED BOURGEOIS WHO WAS MAKING HASTE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS
WHICH PROWLERS CALL FANCHONS AH SEE HERE WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT THERE
THE VENTRILOQUIST HOWEVER FINISHED HIS GRIN SHE WENT ON FRIENDS LISTEN WELL THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT
IN THE MIDST OF ROTTEN OLD CORKS AND DROWNED DOGS SHE WAS FORCED TO PAUSE SHE WAS SEIZED BY A DRY COUGH HER BREATH CAME FROM HER WEAK AND NARROW CHEST LIKE THE DEATH RATTLE SHE RESUMED
AND HER ATTITUDE NOTHING MORE RESOLUTE AND MORE SURPRISING COULD BE SEEN THE SIX RASCALS SPEECHLESS AND GLOOMY AT BEING HELD IN CHECK BY A GIRL RETREATED BENEATH THE SHADOW CAST BY THE LANTERN AND HELD COUNSEL WITH FURIOUS AND
WHERE SHALL WE GO TO SLEEP TO NIGHT UNDER PANTIN PARIS HAVE YOU THE KEY TO THE GATE THENARDIER PARDI
MAD WITH GRIEF NO LONGER CONSCIOUS OF ANYTHING FIXED OR SOLID IN HIS BRAIN INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING ANYTHING THENCEFORTH OF FATE AFTER THOSE TWO MONTHS PASSED IN THE INTOXICATION OF YOUTH AND LOVE
BY THE BOULEVARD TRAVERSED THE ESPLANADE AND THE BRIDGE OF THE INVALIDES
AND AT THE SAME TIME THE CROWD INCREASED IN DENSITY FOR THE PASSERS BY NOW AMOUNTED TO A CROWD NO ONE COULD BE SEEN TO SPEAK IN THIS THRONG AND YET THERE AROSE FROM IT A DULL DEEP MURMUR
WHICH HAD THE FORM OF A HUGE SPIDER THESE STREETS WERE NOT DESERTED THERE COULD BE DESCRIED PILES OF GUNS MOVING BAYONETS AND TROOPS BIVOUACKING NO CURIOUS OBSERVER PASSED THAT LIMIT THERE CIRCULATION CEASED
THERE THE RABBLE ENDED AND THE ARMY BEGAN MARIUS WILLED WITH THE WILL OF A MAN WHO HOPES NO MORE HE HAD BEEN SUMMONED HE MUST GO HE FOUND A MEANS TO TRAVERSE THE THRONG
IT HAD PASSED AND VANISHED PROCEEDING FROM CIRCUIT TO CIRCUIT HE REACHED A LANE WHICH HE JUDGED TO BE THE RUE DE LA POTERIE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THIS STREET
TO MULTIPLY EVERY COMBATANT BY THE POSSIBILITIES WHICH THAT OBSCURITY CONTAINS AT DUSK EVERY WINDOW WHERE A CANDLE WAS BURNING RECEIVED A SHOT THE LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED SOMETIMES THE INHABITANT WAS KILLED HENCE
WHICH HAD ALREADY WITNESSED SO MANY REVOLUTIONARY EVENTS WHILE YOUTH THE SECRET ASSOCIATIONS THE SCHOOLS IN THE NAME OF PRINCIPLES AND THE MIDDLE CLASSES IN THE NAME OF INTERESTS
CLASPING AND THROWING EACH OTHER WHILE EACH ONE HASTENED AND INVITED THE LAST AND DECISIVE HOUR OF THE CRISIS FAR AWAY AND QUITE OUTSIDE OF THIS FATAL QUARTER IN THE MOST PROFOUND DEPTHS OF THE UNFATHOMABLE CAVITIES OF THAT
FOLDED HIS ARMS AND FELL TO THINKING ABOUT HIS FATHER HE THOUGHT OF THAT HEROIC COLONEL PONTMERCY WHO HAD BEEN SO PROUD A SOLDIER WHO HAD GUARDED THE FRONTIER OF FRANCE UNDER THE REPUBLIC
TO OFFER HIS BREAST TO BAYONETS TO SHED HIS BLOOD TO SEEK THE ENEMY TO SEEK DEATH THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO WAGE WAR IN HIS TURN AND DESCEND TO THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND THAT THE FIELD OF BATTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS TO DESCEND WAS THE STREET
HAD HE NOT GIVEN HER HIS WORD OF HONOR THAT HE WOULD DIE SHE HAD GONE KNOWING THAT THIS MEANT THAT IT PLEASED HER THAT MARIUS SHOULD DIE AND THEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE NO LONGER LOVED HIM
CIVIL WAR WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THERE A FOREIGN WAR IS NOT ALL WAR BETWEEN MEN WAR BETWEEN BROTHERS WAR IS QUALIFIED ONLY BY ITS OBJECT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FOREIGN OR CIVIL WAR
THERE IS ONLY JUST AND UNJUST WAR UNTIL THAT DAY WHEN THE GRAND HUMAN AGREEMENT IS CONCLUDED WAR THAT AT LEAST WHICH IS THE EFFORT OF THE FUTURE WHICH IS HASTENING ON AGAINST THE PAST WHICH IS LAGGING IN THE REAR MAY BE NECESSARY
THE ONE IS THE DEFENDER THE OTHER THE LIBERATOR SHALL WE BRAND EVERY APPEAL TO ARMS WITHIN A CITY'S LIMITS WITHOUT TAKING THE OBJECT INTO A CONSIDERATION THEN NOTE THE INFAMY OF BRUTUS MARCEL ARNOULD VON BLANKENHEIM COLIGNY HEDGEROW WAR
AFTER DIDEROT DANTON MULTITUDES HAVE A TENDENCY TO ACCEPT THE MASTER THEIR MASS BEARS WITNESS TO APATHY A CROWD IS EASILY LED AS A WHOLE TO OBEDIENCE MEN MUST BE STIRRED UP PUSHED ON
TREATED ROUGHLY BY THE VERY BENEFIT OF THEIR DELIVERANCE THEIR EYES MUST BE WOUNDED BY THE TRUE LIGHT MUST BE HURLED AT THEM IN TERRIBLE HANDFULS
THEY'RE NICE BOYS AREN'T THEY MARY SAID I'VE ALWAYS WISHED I HAD A BROTHER AND I DO BELIEVE JERRY IS GOING TO BE JUST LIKE ONE ALOUD DORA REPLIED I HAVE NOTICED THAT SOMETIMES HE CALLS YOU LITTLE SISTER TO HERSELF SHE THOUGHT
OH MARY HOW BLIND YOU ARE DREAMILY THE YOUNGER GIRL WAS SAYING THAT'S BECAUSE WE WERE PLAYMATES WHEN WE WERE LITTLE SO VERY LONG AGO OH MY HOW ANCIENT WE ARE DORA SAID TEASINGLY
WHEN JERRY AND I WERE LITTLE WE WERE PLAYMATES I SPENT DAYS AT THE RANCH SOMETIMES HER SWEET FACE WAS VERY SAD AS SHE ENDED WITH UNTIL MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS EIGHT THEN YOU CAME EAST TO BOARDING SCHOOL AND BECAME LIKE A SISTER TO ME
I'M CRAZY ABOUT MYSTERIES AS YOU KNOW AND IF THERE REALLY IS ONE ABOUT THAT ROCK HOUSE I WANT TO TRY TO SOLVE IT SHE SAID NO MORE ABOUT IT JUST THEN AS THEY HAD REACHED THE OLD GHOST TOWN OF GLEESON
DORA EXCLAIMED AS SHE RODE CLOSE TO THE PORCH THANKS A LOT SHE CALLED BRIGHTLY UP TO THE OLD MAN WHO WAS HANDING THE PACKET DOWN OVER THE SAGGING WOODEN RAIL HIS FRIENDLY TOOTHLESS SMILE WAS DIRECTED AT THE SMALLER GIRL
HE SAID MIS FARLEY YER NURSE WOMAN CAME DOWN TER MAIL SOME LETTERS A SPELL BACK THEN BEFORE MARY COULD REPLY HE CONTINUED IN HIS SHRILL WAVERING VOICE
DICK HAS BEEN GOING TO THE ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY THIS WINTER TO BE NEAR HIS MOTHER SHE'S A WIDOW AND HE'S HER ONLY SON HER HUSBAND WAS A DOCTOR AND THEY LIVED BACK IN BOSTON BEFORE HE DIED DEW TELL THE OLD MAN WAGGED HIS HEAD SYMPATHETICALLY
YOU WAIT UNTIL DICK HAS BEEN ON THE DESERT LONG ENOUGH TO GET A COAT OF TAN HE MAY SURPRISE YOU
A BRIGHT BLACK EYED MEXICAN BOY OF ABOUT TEN RAN OUT TO THE ROAD AS THE GIRLS APPROACHED COME ON EMANUEL MARY SANG DOWN TO HIM YOU MAY PUT UP OUR HORSES AND EARN A DIME THE SMALL BOY'S WHITE TEETH FLASHED IN A DELIGHTED GRIN
ITS BROAD PORCH AND ADOBE PILLARS HERE HER MOTHER HAD COME AS A BRIDE HERE MARY HAD BEEN BORN EIGHT HAPPY YEARS THEY HAD SPENT TOGETHER BEFORE HER MOTHER DIED AFTER MARY HAD BEEN TAKEN EAST TO SCHOOL HER FATHER HAD RETURNED
THEN GLANCING UP AT THE NURSE WHO HAD APPEARED FROM HER FATHER'S BEDROOM SHE ASKED EAGERLY MAY I TELL DAD AN ADVENTURE WE'VE HAD MISSUS FARLEY MIDDLE AGED KIND FACED SHOOK HER HEAD SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL NOT TONIGHT PLEASE WON'T TOMORROW DO
THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL POINTSMAN OF OUR AGE THE MAN WHO HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GENERATION TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE THOUGHT OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HAS PASSED AWAY AND WE ARE LEFT TO MEASURE THE LOSS TO HUMANITY BY THE RESULT OF HIS LABORS
THAT HE BORROWED FROM WHEWELL MUCH OF HIS CLASSIFICATION FROM BROWN THE CHIEF LINES OF HIS THEORY OF CAUSATION FROM SIR JOHN HERSCHEL THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE INDUCTIVE METHODS THOSE WHO THINK THIS A DISPARAGEMENT OF HIS WORK MUST HAVE VERY LITTLE CONCEPTION
OF THE MASS OF ORIGINAL THOUGHT THAT STILL REMAINS TO MISTER MILL'S CREDIT THE GREAT CRITICAL POWER THAT COULD GATHER VALUABLE TRUTHS FROM SO MANY DISCORDANT SOURCES AND THE WONDERFUL SYNTHETIC ABILITY REQUIRED TO WELD THESE AND HIS OWN CONTRIBUTIONS
SOME GENERAL PROPOSITIONS TO START WITH AND THESE GENERAL PROPOSITIONS BEING EX
NEVER HAS THE LIBEL OF HUMANITY INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT THEOLOGY BEEN MORE FORCIBLY POINTED OUT WITH ITS CONSTANT APPEAL TO LOW MOTIVES OF PERSONAL GAIN
WE HAVE RECOGNIZED IN REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE IDEAL TYPE OF THE MOST PERFECT POLITY FOR WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE ANY PORTION OF MANKIND ARE BETTER ADAPTED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL IMPROVEMENT AS THEY RANGE LOWER AND LOWER IN DEVELOPMENT
AS UPON THE DEGREE IN WHICH THEY POSSESS CERTAIN SPECIAL REQUISITES REQUISITES HOWEVER SO CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL ADVANCEMENT THAT ANY VARIATION BETWEEN THE TWO IS RATHER THE EXCEPTION THAN THE RULE
WHO HAVE GAINED POWER OVER THE COUNTRY ARE DISPOSED TO OFFER IT THE BOON TO INDIVIDUAL REFORMERS THE QUESTION IS ALMOST IRRELEVANT SINCE IF NO OTHER OBJECTION CAN BE MADE TO THEIR ENTERPRISE THAN THAT THE OPINION OF THE NATION IS NOT YET ON THEIR SIDE
THEY SELDOM OBTAIN A FOOTING AT ALL AND IF THEY DO ARE ALMOST SURE TO BE OVERTHROWN AS SOON AS THE HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OR ANY PARTY LEADER WHO CAN MUSTER FORCE FOR A COUP DE MAIN IS WILLING TO RUN SOME SMALL RISK FOR ABSOLUTE POWER
A MILITARY LEADER IS THE ONLY SUPERIOR TO WHOM THEY WILL SUBMIT EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY SOME PROPHET SUPPOSED TO BE INSPIRED FROM ABOVE OR CONJURER REGARDED AS POSSESSING MIRACULOUS POWER THESE MAY EXERCISE A TEMPORARY ASCENDANCY
AND WERE ONLY SUFFICIENTLY PRESENT TO SERVE AS AN APPETISING SAUCE THAT SAUCE WAS MADE UP OF CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS OF AGONISING INWARD ANALYSIS AND ALL THESE PANGS AND PIN PRICKS GAVE A CERTAIN PIQUANCY
EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
I CAME IN FOR COUNTLESS MILLIONS AND IMMEDIATELY DEVOTED THEM TO HUMANITY AND AT THE SAME TIME I CONFESSED BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE MY SHAMEFUL DEEDS WHICH OF COURSE WERE NOT MERELY SHAMEFUL BUT HAD IN THEM
MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
TO VISIT MY SUPERIOR AT THE OFFICE ANTON ANTONITCH SYETOTCHKIN HE WAS THE ONLY PERMANENT ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE
ON RETURNING HOME I DEFERRED FOR A TIME MY DESIRE TO EMBRACE ALL MANKIND I HAD HOWEVER ONE OTHER ACQUAINTANCE OF A SORT SIMONOV WHO WAS AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW I HAD A NUMBER OF SCHOOLFELLOWS INDEED IN PETERSBURG
WHO HAD IN NO WAY BEEN DISTINGUISHED AT SCHOOL WAS OF A QUIET AND EQUABLE DISPOSITION BUT I DISCOVERED IN HIM A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER AND EVEN HONESTY I DON'T EVEN SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY STUPID
BUT I HAD NOT EXPECTED SUCH CONTEMPT SIMONOV WAS POSITIVELY SURPRISED AT MY TURNING UP
BY THEN HE HAD TAKEN TO CUTTING ME IN THE STREET AND I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF COMPROMISING HIMSELF BY GREETING A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS ME I SAW HIM ONCE IN THE THEATRE IN THE THIRD TIER OF BOXES
THEY HAD KEPT UP WITH HIM FOR THOSE THREE YEARS THOUGH PRIVATELY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH HIM I AM CONVINCED OF THAT OF SIMONOV'S TWO VISITORS ONE WAS FERFITCHKIN A RUSSIANISED GERMAN
THAT I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM OH THERE'S NO MAKING YOU OUT WITH THESE REFINEMENTS TRUDOLYUBOV JEERED WE'LL PUT YOUR NAME DOWN SIMONOV DECIDED ADDRESSING ME
WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY FERFITCHKIN BEGAN IN AN UNDERTONE INDICATING ME TO SIMONOV BUT HE BROKE OFF FOR EVEN SIMONOV WAS EMBARRASSED THAT WILL DO SAID TRUDOLYUBOV GETTING UP IF HE WANTS TO COME SO MUCH LET HIM
TRUDOLYUBOV BARELY NODDED SIMONOV WITH WHOM I WAS LEFT TETE A TETE WAS IN A STATE OF VEXATION AND PERPLEXITY AND LOOKED AT ME QUEERLY
THAT IS TO BE TRUTHFUL YES I HAVE TO GO AND SEE SOMEONE NOT FAR FROM HERE
MY GOODNESS WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO I CRIED
NOT TO PAY HIM WAS IMPOSSIBLE CONSIDERING HIS CHARACTER BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT FELLOW ABOUT THAT PLAGUE OF MINE ANOTHER TIME HOWEVER I KNEW I SHOULD GO AND SHOULD NOT PAY HIM HIS WAGES THAT NIGHT I HAD THE MOST HIDEOUS DREAMS
HOW MANY FINE LOOKING BOYS CAME TO US IN A FEW YEARS THEY BECAME REPULSIVE EVEN AT SIXTEEN I WONDERED AT THEM MOROSELY EVEN THEN I WAS STRUCK BY THE PETTINESS OF THEIR THOUGHTS THE STUPIDITY OF THEIR PURSUITS
IT WAS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THAT DROVE ME TO IT AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT THRUST UPON ME YOUR HACKNEYED REMARKS REPEATED TO NAUSEA THAT I WAS ONLY A DREAMER WHILE THEY EVEN THEN HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE
THEY TOOK RANK FOR INTELLIGENCE EVEN AT SIXTEEN THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT A SNUG BERTH OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS DUE TO THEIR STUPIDITY TO THE BAD EXAMPLES WITH WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD
BUT WERE MORALLY IMPRESSED ESPECIALLY AS THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO NOTICE ME ON THOSE GROUNDS THE MOCKERY CEASED BUT THE HOSTILITY REMAINED AND COLD AND STRAINED RELATIONS BECAME PERMANENT BETWEEN US IN THE END I COULD NOT PUT UP WITH IT
ONCE INDEED I DID HAVE A FRIEND
AND REPULSED HIM AS THOUGH ALL I NEEDED HIM FOR WAS TO WIN A VICTORY OVER HIM TO SUBJUGATE HIM AND NOTHING ELSE BUT I COULD NOT SUBJUGATE ALL OF THEM MY FRIEND WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THEM EITHER HE WAS IN FACT A RARE EXCEPTION
THE FIRST THING I DID ON LEAVING SCHOOL WAS TO GIVE UP THE SPECIAL JOB FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN DESTINED SO AS TO BREAK ALL TIES
AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHY AFTER ALL THAT I SHOULD GO TRUDGING OFF TO SIMONOV'S EARLY NEXT MORNING I ROUSED MYSELF AND JUMPED OUT OF BED WITH EXCITEMENT AS THOUGH IT WERE ALL ABOUT TO HAPPEN AT ONCE
I WENT TO THE OFFICE HOWEVER AS USUAL BUT SNEAKED AWAY HOME TWO HOURS EARLIER TO GET READY THE GREAT THING I THOUGHT IS NOT TO BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE OR THEY WILL THINK I AM OVERJOYED AT COMING BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SUCH
WITH DESPAIR I PICTURED TO MYSELF HOW COLDLY AND DISDAINFULLY THAT SCOUNDREL ZVERKOV WOULD MEET ME
BUT THAT WAS MOST IMPOSSIBLE OF ALL IF I FEEL IMPELLED TO DO ANYTHING I SEEM TO BE PITCHFORKED INTO IT I SHOULD HAVE JEERED AT MYSELF EVER AFTERWARDS SO YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED THE REAL THING
ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
WE WOULD BE RECONCILED AND DRINK TO OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP BUT WHAT WAS MOST BITTER AND HUMILIATING FOR ME WAS THAT I KNEW EVEN THEN KNEW FULLY AND FOR CERTAIN THAT I NEEDED NOTHING OF ALL THIS REALLY THAT I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO CRUSH
TO SUBDUE TO ATTRACT THEM
OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
BUT MODERN MILTON IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS AS OLD MILTON
AND ARE THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE SOUTHERN COAST FROM THEM THE MASSACHUSET TRIBE ABOUT THE BAY DERIVED ITS NAME SIGNIFYING NEAR THE GREAT HILLS WHICH NAME WAS CHANGED BY THE ENGLISH TO MASSACHUSETTS
THE VIEW FROM THE BACK HOLDS EVEN MORE INTIMATE ATTRACTION HERE IS THE OLD OLD GARDEN AND ALTHOUGH THE EPHEMERAL BLOSSOMS OF THE PRESENT SPRINGTIME SHINE BRIGHTLY FORTH THE BOX FULL TWENTY FEET HIGH SPEAKS OF ANOTHER EPOCH
NOT ONLY NOTABLE PERSONAGES BUT NOTABLE EVENTS HAVE BEEN ENGENDERED UNDER THE SHADOW OF THESE HILLS THE SUFFOLK RESOLVES WHICH WERE THE PRELUDE OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WERE ADOPTED AT THE VOSE HOUSE
OF ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND ACRES A LABYRINTH OF IDYLLIC FOOTPATHS AND LEAFY TRAILS OF TWISTING DRIVES AND WALKS THAT OPEN OUT UPON SUPERB VISTAS IS NOW THE PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS THE GRANITE QUARRY MAN
THE WHOLE REGION WAS TAKEN OVER BY THE STATE IN EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR AS YOU PASS THROUGH THE RESERVATION AND IF YOU ARE TAKING EVEN THE MOST CURSORY GLIMPSE OF MILTON YOU MUST INCLUDE SOME PORTION OF THIS PARK
ERECTED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY THE LATE A LAWRENCE ROTCH OF MILTON WHO BEQUEATHED FUNDS FOR ITS MAINTENANCE IT IS NOW CONNECTED WITH HARVARD UNIVERSITY
OBJECTS BOTH NEAR AND FAR BEGIN TO APPEAR AND SOON IF THE DAY IS CLEAR BUILDINGS MAY BE IDENTIFIED IN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE VILLAGES WE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE SEA ON THE HIGHEST COASTLAND
OF THE UNCANOONUC MOUNTAINS FIFTY NINE MILES AWAY THIS THEN IS THE GREAT BLUE HILL OF MILTON THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW ENGLAND CAN STAND HERE AND PICK OUT A HUNDRED DISTINGUISHING LANDMARKS
LIKE CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN GAMES TO HAVE THEIR GRAIN GROUND ISRAEL STOUGHTON WAS THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO ESTABLISHED THIS FIRST MILL A NAME PERPETUATED
BUT MEN OF BRAINS AND CHARACTER WERE TAUGHT THERE LESSONS WHICH STOOD THEM AND THE COLONY IN GOOD STEAD ONE FANCIES THE STUDENTS ROVING EYES MAY HAVE OCCASIONALLY STRAYED DOWN THE INDIAN TRAIL DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE OLD SITE A TRAIL WHICH
ALTHOUGH NOW ATTAINED TO THE PROUD RANK OF A LANE CHURCHILL'S LANE STILL INVITES ONE DOWN ITS TANGLED GREEN WAY ALONG THE GRAY STONE WALL YES EVERY STEP OF GROUND HAS ITS TRADITION HERE
AGAIN WE ARE DRAWN BACK TO THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNET OF THOSE MIGHTY MONITORS YES WHEREVER ONE GOES IN MILTON EITHER ON FOOT TO DAY OR BACK THROUGH THE CHAPTERS OF THREE CENTURIES AGO THE BLUE HILLS DOMINATE EVERY EVENT
EARTHEN FLOOR AND A STAGE BEHIND THE CHARMING STEEPLE STYLE MADE POPULAR BY SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN AND NOW MULTIPLIED IN COUNTLESS GRACEFUL EXAMPLES ALL OVER NEW ENGLAND
BUT A LITTLE LATER THE BELLRINGER WILL STAND ABOVE AND THROUGH A PANE OF GLASS LET INTO THE CEILING HE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHEN THE MINISTER ENTERS THE PULPIT THE ORIGINAL BACKLESS BENCHES WERE REPLACED BY BOX PEWS WITH NARROW SEATS LIKE SHELVES
SOMETIMES MAN AND WOMAN AND A CHILD OR TWO ON HORSEBACK NO MATTER HOW WILD THE STORM HOW SWOLLEN THE STREAMS HOW DEEP THE WHIRLING SNOW THEY ALL COME TO CHURCH
THAT THEY ARE INTERMINABLE WE KNOW THE TITHING MAN OR CLERK MAY TURN THE BRASS BOUND HOURGLASS BY THE SIDE OF THE PULPIT TWO AND THREE TIMES DURING THE SERMON AND ONCE OR TWICE DURING THE PRAYER INTERMINABLE
THEY STAND TOO WHILE THE PSALMS AND HYMNS ARE LINED OUT AND AS THEY SING THEM VERY UNCERTAINLY AND VERY INCORRECTLY THIS PERFORMANCE ALONE SOMETIMES TAKES AN HOUR AS THERE IS NO ORGAN NOR NOTES
APPEALING TO THE EMOTIONS QUITE AS VIVIDLY ALTHOUGH THROUGH A DIFFERENT CHANNEL AS THE MOST ELABORATE CEREMONIAL WHEN THE SOUL IS WROUGHT TO A CERTAIN PITCH EACH HARDSHIP IS MERELY AN ADDED OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE ITS FAITH
HAVING DONE ITS WORK HAVING FOUNDED SOUNDLY AND PEOPLED STRONGLY AN EXCEPTIONAL REGION THE NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE HAD NO FURTHER NECESSITY FOR BEING THOSE WHOM IT NOW TORTURES WITH ITS HOT PINCERS OF DOUBT AND SELF REPROACH
SHELTERED IN ITS PRIME NINE GENERATIONS OF THE SAME FAMILY THE RAINBOW ROOF HOUSE SO CALLED FROM THE DELICIOUS CURVE IN ITS ROOF IS ONE OF HINGHAM'S PRETTIEST TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD COTTAGES AND MISS SUSAN B WILLARD'S COTTAGE
YOU CANNOT LIFT YOUR EYES BUT THEY REST UPON SOME BUILDING RAISED TWO CENTURIES AND MORE AGO THE SHADE WHICH RIPPLES UNDER YOUR FEET IS CAST BY ELMS PLANTED BY THAT VERY HAND OF THE PAST EVEN YOUR VOICE REPEATS THE WORDS WHICH THOSE OLD PATRIARCHS
AUNT COCKLETOP WAS RIGHT AS YOU WILL SEE WHEN I HAVE TOLD THE SAD HISTORY OF THIS UNFORTUNATE FAMILY THE TRAGEDY BEGAN WITH CHANTY WHO WAS THE BOLDEST LITTLE COCKADOODLE WHO EVER TRIED TO CROW
CHANTY THOUGHT HE COULD BEAT MISTER BANTAM EASILY HE WAS SO SMALL AND INVITED HIM TO FIGHT MISTER B DECLINED THEN CHANTY CALLED HIM A COWARD AND GAVE MISSUS B A PECK
AND IT DID SEEM SO FOR THE VERY NEXT WEEK SPECKLE THE BEST AND PRETTIEST OF THE BROOD WENT TO WALK WITH AUNT COCKLETOP GRASSHOPPERING THEY CALLED IT IN THE GREAT FIELD ACROSS THE ROAD
WHAT SHALL I DO IT WAS A DREADFUL BLOW TO MISSUS CLUCK AND AUNT COCKLETOP DIDN'T SHOW HERSELF FOR A WHOLE DAY AFTER THAT STORY WAS KNOWN
FOR EVERY FOWL IN THE YARD TWITTED HER WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER PREACHING AND HER PRACTICE
YOU'LL FALL AND GET HURT SAID HIS SISTER BLOT HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU UGLY LITTLE THING AND DON'T TALK TO ME I'M GOING TO CROW AND CAN'T BE INTERRUPTED BY ANY SILLY BIT OF A HEN BE QUIET DOWN THERE
FOR POOR STRUT HE LEANED SO FAR FORWARD IN HIS FRANTIC EFFORT TO GET A BIG CROW OUT THAT HE TOPPLED OVER AND FELL BUMP ON THE HARD BARN FLOOR KILLING HIMSELF INSTANTLY
FOR SOME TIME AFTER THIS MISSUS CLUCK KEPT HER THREE REMAINING LITTLE ONES CLOSE TO HER SIDE WATCHING OVER THEM WITH MATERNAL CARE TILL THEY WERE HEARTILY TIRED OF HER ANXIOUS CLUCKINGS PEEP AND PECK WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER
WITH HER POOR LITTLE CLAWS STICKING STRAIGHT UP AS IF IMPLORING HELP PECK MEANWHILE GOT INTO MISCHIEF ALSO
SHE STRAYED INTO THE SHEEP SHED AND FINDING SOME SALT ATE AS MUCH AS SHE LIKED NOT KNOWING THAT SALT IS BAD FOR HENS HAVING TAKEN ALL SHE WANTED SHE RAN BACK TO THE BARN
DON'T FLAP AND STAGGER SO LET ME HOLD YOU TASTE THIS MINT LEAF HAVE A DROP OF WATER WHAT SHALL I DO AS POOR MISSUS CLUCK SIGHED AND SOBBED HER UNHAPPY CHILD WENT SCUFFLING ABOUT ON HER BACK
GASPING AND ROLLING UP HER EYES IN GREAT ANGUISH FOR SHE HAD EATEN TOO MUCH OF THE FATAL SALT AND THERE WAS NO HELP FOR HER WHEN ALL WAS OVER THEY BURIED THE DEAD CHICKEN UNDER A CURRANT BUSH COVERED THE LITTLE GRAVE WITH CHICKWEED
AND WERE SEEN BY THEIR SURVIVING RELATIVES FEATHERLESS PALE AND STIFF BORNE AWAY TO SOME UNKNOWN PLACE WHENCE NO FOWL RETURNED BLOT WAS WAKED ONE NIGHT BY A GREAT CACKLING AND FLUTTERING IN THE HEN HOUSE
AND PEEPING DOWN FROM HER PERCH SAW A GREAT HAND GLIDE ALONG THE ROOST CLUTCH HER BELOVED MOTHER BY THE LEG AND PULL HER OFF SCREAMING DOLEFULLY
SAID THE KIT RUBBING HER SOFT WHITE FACE AGAINST BLOT'S LITTLE BLACK BREAST
AND COLDER AND COLDER BECAME POOR BLOT'S LITTLE FEET AS SHE WADED THROUGH THE DRIFTS THE FIRELIGHT WAS SHINING OUT INTO THE GLOOM
AND WITH A SHIVER PUT HER LITTLE HEAD UNDER HER WING TRYING TO FORGET HUNGER WEARINESS AND THE BITTER COLD AND WAIT PATIENTLY FOR MORNING BUT WHEN MORNING CAME LITTLE BLOT LAY FROZEN STIFF UNDER A COVERLET OF SNOW
THEY HAD JUST HAD THEIR BATH AND STOOD ARRANGING THEIR FEATHERS WITH THEIR GREAT BILLS
WHEN FED THEY GOBBLED UP THE FISH NEVER STOPPING TO SWALLOW IT TILL THE POUCHES UNDER THEIR BILLS WERE FULL THEN THEY LEISURELY EMPTIED THEM AND SEEMED TO ENJOY THEIR LUNCH WITH THE GRAVE DELIBERATION OF REGULAR ENGLISHMEN
AND THERE FOUND A SPLENDID SIGHT SIX LIONS AND LIONESSES IN THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT CAGES SITTING OR STANDING IN DIGNIFIED ATTITUDES AND EYEING THE SPECTATORS WITH A MILD EXPRESSION IN THEIR FINE EYES
ONE LIONESS WAS ILL AND LAY ON HER BED LOOKING VERY PENSIVE WHILE HER MATE MOVED RESTLESSLY ABOUT HER EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND MUCH AFFLICTED BY HER SUFFERING
ONE LITTLE LEOPARD WAS BETTER BRED THAN THE OTHERS FOR HE WENT UP ON A SHELF IN THE CAGE AND ATE HIS DINNER IN A QUIET PROPER MANNER WHICH WAS AN EXAMPLE TO THE REST THE LIONS ATE IN DIGNIFIED SILENCE
HE WAS A CROSS OLD PARTY AND SAT HUDDLED UP IN THE STRAW SCOWLING AT EVERY ONE LIKE AN ILL TEMPERED OLD BACHELOR HALF A DOZEN LITTLE ONES TEASED HIM CAPITALLY BY DROPPING BITS OF BREAD
OUT I SAID TO MYSELF THINKING OF A STORY I READ ONCE OF A PERSON IN A MENAGERIE WHO TURNED SUDDENLY AND SAW A GREAT BOA GLIDING TOWARDS HIM
WHERE SUCH UNPLEASANT NEIGHBOURS MIGHT POP IN UPON YOU UNEXPECTEDLY HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO TAKE A PROMENADE AND SHOW ME HIS SIZE WHICH SEEMED IMMENSE AS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF
WHICH I HADN'T THE HEART TO STAY AND SEE HIM DEVOUR ALIVE I WAS WALKING TOWARD THE CAMEL'S PAGODA WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A LONG DARK CURLING THING CAME OVER MY SHOULDER AND I FELT WARM BREATH IN MY FACE IT'S THE BOA I THOUGHT
AND IN AN IMMENSE WIRE COVERED AVIARY ALL SORTS OF BRILLIANT BIRDS WERE FLYING ABOUT AS GAILY AS IF AT HOME ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES WAS A SEA COW WHO LIVED IN A TANK OF SALT WATER
I HAD NO SOONER SAT UP THAN ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND MY PRESENT SITUATION INSTANTLY CAME TO ME MY HAIR WAS STIFF WITH ICE THERE WAS NO MORE FEELING IN MY HANDS THAN HAD THEY BEEN OF STONE
THERE WAS LESS SPITE IN ITS WASH LESS FURY IN ITS BLOW THE MULTITUDINOUS ROARING OF THE HEAVING BLACKNESS HAD SOBERED INTO A HARD AND SULLEN GROWLING A SOUND AS OF THUNDER AMONG MOUNTAINS HEARD IN A VALLEY
IT WAS WONDERFUL HOWEVER THAT SHE SHOULD STILL BE AFLOAT NO MAN COULD HAVE HEARD THE RENDING AND GRATING OF HER SIDE AGAINST THE ICE WITHOUT SUPPOSING THAT EVERY PLANK IN IT WAS BEING TORN OUT
I SWALLOWED HALF A PANNIKIN OF THE HOLLANDS FOR THE SAKE OF THE WARMTH AND LIFE OF THE DRAUGHT AND ENTERING MY CABIN PUT ON THICK DRY STOCKINGS FIRST CHAFING MY FEET TILL I FELT THE BLOOD IN THEM
FOR THEY LAY UNDER A WHOLE BODY OF SHROUDS COMPLICATED BY A MASS OF OTHER GEAR AGAINST WHICH LEANED A PORTION OF THE CABOOSE I VIEWED THEM LONG ENOUGH TO SATISFY MY MIND THAT THEY WERE DEAD AND THEN WITH A HEART OF LEAD TURNED AWAY
BUT THE MOTION OF THE BRIG CONTINUED VERY HEAVY A LARGE SWELL HAVING BEEN SET RUNNING BY THE LONG FIERCE GALE THAT WAS GONE AND THERE BEING NO UPROAR OF TEMPEST IN THE SKY TO CONFOUND THE SENSES
I HAD NOTICED THE JOLLY BOAT BOTTOM UP NEAR THE STARBOARD GANGWAY AND SO FAR AS I COULD MAKE OUT BY THROWING THE DULL LANTERN LIGHT UPON HER SHE WAS SOUND BUT I COULD NOT HAVE LAUNCHED HER WITHOUT SEEING WHAT I WAS DOING
THERE WERE A FEW STARS DYING OUT IN THE DARK WEST THE ATMOSPHERE WAS CLEAR AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE I KNEW HE WOULD TURN THE SABLE PALL OVERHEAD INTO BLUENESS THE HULL LAY VERY DEEP
BUT I MET WITH AN OAR THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE OTHER BOAT AND THIS WITH THE MAST AND SAIL I DROPPED INTO HER THE SWELL LIFTING HER UP TO MY HAND WHEN THE BLUE FOLD SWUNG PAST MY NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO VICTUAL HER
THE HEAVY SLUGGISH SODDEN MOVEMENT OF THE HULL ADVISED ME TO MAKE HASTE SHE WAS NOW BARELY LIFTING TO THE SWELL THAT CAME BRIMMING IN BROAD LIQUID BLUE BROWS TO HER STEM
TILL ALL THAT QUARTER OF THE SEA LOOKED TO BE A MASS OF LEAPING DAZZLE UPON THE EASTERN SEA LINE LAY A RANGE OF WHITE CLOUDS COMPACT AS THE CHALK CLIFFS OF DOVER
AND HER MAIN DECK BLEW UP WITH A LOUD CLAP OR BLAST OF NOISE I COULD FOLLOW THE LINE OF HER BULWARKS FLUCTUATING AND WAVING IN THE CLEAR DARK BLUE WHEN SHE WAS SOME FEET UNDER
AND WHICH SHE DRAGGED DOWN WITH HER ON A SUDDEN WHEN THE LAST FRAGMENT OF MAST HAD DISAPPEARED AND WHEN THE HOLLOWS OF THE WHIRLPOOLS WERE FLATTENING TO THE LEVEL SURFACE OF THE SEA UP ROSE A BODY WITH A SORT OF LEAP
IT WAS THE SAILOR THAT HAD LAIN DROWNED ON THE STARBOARD SIDE OF THE FORWARD DECK BEING FROZEN STIFF HE ROSE IN THE POSTURE IN WHICH HE HAD EXPIRED THAT IS WITH HIS ARMS EXTENDED
SO THAT WHEN HE JUMPED TO THE SURFACE HE CAME WITH HIS HANDS LIFTED UP TO HEAVEN AND THUS HE STAYED A MINUTE SUSTAINED BY THE EDDIES WHICH ALSO REVOLVED HIM THE SHOCK OCCASIONED BY THIS MELANCHOLY OBJECT WAS SO GREAT
AND HAULING THE SHEET AFT PUT THE OAR OVER THE STERN AND BROUGHT THE LITTLE CRAFT'S HEAD TO AN EASTERLY COURSE THE DRAUGHT OF AIR WAS EXTREMELY WEAK AND SCARCE FURNISHED IMPULSE ENOUGH TO THE SAIL TO RAISE A BUBBLE ALONGSIDE
WHERE PERCHANCE I MIGHT MEET A WHALER OR A SOUTHSEAMAN FROM NEW HOLLAND BUT MY HEART SANK AT THE PROSPECT OF THE LEAGUES OF WATER WHICH ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND THE ISLANDS AND THE WESTERN AMERICAN SEABOARD INDEED
THE FRESH MORNING AIR FLOWING THROUGH MY OPEN WINDOW COOLED AND COMPOSED ME THE MERCY OF SLEEP FOUND ME WHEN I WOKE AND LOOKED AT MY WATCH I WAS A NEW MAN THE HOUR WAS NOON I RANG MY BELL
THE SERVANT ANNOUNCED THAT A MAN WAS WAITING TO SEE ME THE SAME MAN SIR WHO WAS FOUND IN THE GARDEN LOOKING AT YOUR FLOWERS I AT ONCE GAVE DIRECTIONS TO HAVE HIM SHOWN UP INTO MY BEDROOM
A LAPSE OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FOLLOWED THE LAST DOSE WAS REPEATED AND THE DOG SOON SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN AS LIVELY AS EVER GLOODY WAS THEREUPON TOLD TO SET THE ANIMAL FREE AND WAS INFORMED AT THE SAME TIME
IS THERE ANYTHING MORE I ASKED THAT I OUGHT TO KNOW ONLY ONE THING MISTER ROYLAKE THAT I CAN THINK OF GLOODY REPLIED I'M AFRAID IT'S MISS CRISTEL'S TURN NEXT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHILE THE DEAF MAN LODGES AT THE COTTAGE HE MEANS MISCHIEF AND HIS EYE IS ON MISS CRISTEL EARLY THIS MORNING SIR I HAPPENED TO BE AT THE BOAT HOUSE SOMEBODY I LEAVE YOU TO GUESS WHO IT IS HAS STOLEN THE OARS
AND NOTHING MORE THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN AND OUGHT TO TELL ME NOTHING SIR
BUT WAS NOW INSTINCTIVELY ON HIS GUARD FOR FEAR OF BINDING HIMSELF IN ANY WAY TO ALL QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM WHETHER IMPORTANT OR QUITE TRIFLING SUCH AS WHERE WOULD HE LIVE WAS HE GOING TO REBUILD WHEN WAS HE GOING TO PETERSBURG
WHICH HAD NOT BEEN BURNED IN VOZDVIZHENKA STREET HE DROVE THAT SAME EVENING TO SEE HER ON HIS WAY TO THE HOUSE PIERRE KEPT THINKING OF PRINCE ANDREW OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP OF HIS VARIOUS MEETINGS WITH HIM AND ESPECIALLY OF THE LAST ONE AT BORODINO
AND YET SO SIMILAR IN THAT THEY HAD BOTH LIVED AND BOTH DIED AND IN THE LOVE HE FELT FOR BOTH OF THEM PIERRE DROVE UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE OLD PRINCE IN A MOST SERIOUS MOOD THE HOUSE HAD ESCAPED THE FIRE IT SHOWED SIGNS OF DAMAGE BUT ITS GENERAL ASPECT WAS UNCHANGED THE OLD FOOTMAN
YES SIR SAID THE MAN PLEASE STEP INTO THE PORTRAIT GALLERY A FEW MINUTES LATER THE FOOTMAN RETURNED
IN A RATHER LOW ROOM LIT BY ONE CANDLE SAT THE PRINCESS AND WITH HER ANOTHER PERSON DRESSED IN BLACK PIERRE REMEMBERED THAT THE PRINCESS ALWAYS HAD LADY COMPANIONS BUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHAT THEY WERE LIKE HE NEVER KNEW OR REMEMBERED THIS MUST BE ONE OF HER COMPANIONS HE THOUGHT
AND OF WHICH HE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN THINKING ESPECIALLY AT THAT MOMENT IT SUFFUSED HIM SEIZED HIM AND ENVELOPED HIM COMPLETELY WHEN SHE SMILED DOUBT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE IT WAS NATASHA AND HE LOVED HER
A MAN WHO HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE POST WHEN DRON DIED AND WHO WAS ACCUSED OF DISHONESTY AND VARIOUS IRREGULARITIES NICHOLAS WENT OUT INTO THE PORCH TO QUESTION HIM AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ELDER HAD GIVEN A FEW REPLIES THE SOUND OF CRIES AND BLOWS WERE HEARD
ON RETURNING TO LUNCH NICHOLAS WENT UP TO HIS WIFE WHO SAT WITH HER HEAD BENT LOW OVER HER EMBROIDERY FRAME AND AS USUAL BEGAN TO TELL HER WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING THAT MORNING AMONG OTHER THINGS HE SPOKE OF THE BOGUCHAROVO ELDER COUNTESS MARY TURNED RED AND THEN PALE
NICHOLAS WOULD TURN THE BROKEN RING ON HIS FINGER AND WOULD DROP HIS EYES BEFORE THE MAN WHO WAS MAKING HIM ANGRY BUT HE DID FORGET HIMSELF ONCE OR TWICE WITHIN A TWELVEMONTH AND THEN HE WOULD GO AND CONFESS TO HIS WIFE AND WOULD AGAIN PROMISE THAT THIS SHOULD REALLY BE THE VERY LAST TIME
LEAVING HOME FOR A MONTH OR EVEN TWO WITH HIS HUNT IN WINTER HE VISITED HIS OTHER VILLAGES OR SPENT HIS TIME READING THE BOOKS HE READ WERE CHIEFLY HISTORICAL AND ON THESE HE SPENT A CERTAIN SUM EVERY YEAR
SHE IS A STERILE FLOWER YOU KNOW LIKE SOME STRAWBERRY BLOSSOMS
WHAT FORCE MOVES THE NATIONS BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORIANS AND HISTORIANS OF SEPARATE NATIONS UNDERSTAND THIS FORCE AS A POWER INHERENT IN HEROES AND RULERS IN THEIR NARRATION EVENTS OCCUR SOLELY BY THE WILL OF A NAPOLEON AND ALEXANDER
AT ONE TIME PROVE NAPOLEON TO BE A PRODUCT OF THE REVOLUTION OF THE IDEAS OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE AND SO FORTH AND AT ANOTHER PLAINLY SAY THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE AND OTHER THINGS THEY DO NOT LIKE WERE SIMPLY THE PRODUCT OF NAPOLEON'S MISDIRECTED WILL
THIS CONTRADICTION OCCURS BECAUSE AFTER ENTERING THE FIELD OF ANALYSIS THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS STOP HALFWAY TO FIND COMPONENT FORCES EQUAL TO THE COMPOSITE OR RESULTANT FORCE THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS MUST EQUAL THE RESULTANT
AND SO TO EXPLAIN THE RESULTANT FORCES THEY ARE OBLIGED TO ADMIT IN ADDITION TO THE INSUFFICIENT COMPONENTS ANOTHER UNEXPLAINED FORCE AFFECTING THE RESULTANT ACTION
TRIES TO PROVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN AND THE RESTORATION OF THE BOURBONS WERE DUE TO OTHER THINGS BESIDE ALEXANDER'S WILL SUCH AS THE ACTIVITY OF STEIN METTERNICH MADAME DE STAEL TALLEYRAND
FICHTE CHATEAUBRIAND AND OTHERS THE HISTORIAN EVIDENTLY DECOMPOSES ALEXANDER'S POWER INTO THE COMPONENTS TALLEYRAND CHATEAUBRIAND AND THE REST BUT THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS THAT IS THE INTERACTIONS OF CHATEAUBRIAND
A THIRD CLASS OF HISTORIANS THE SO CALLED HISTORIANS OF CULTURE FOLLOWING THE PATH LAID DOWN BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS WHO SOMETIMES ACCEPT WRITERS AND LADIES AS FORCES PRODUCING EVENTS AGAIN TAKE THAT FORCE TO BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
ONE THAT HISTORY IS WRITTEN BY LEARNED MEN AND SO IT IS NATURAL AND AGREEABLE FOR THEM TO THINK THAT THE ACTIVITY OF THEIR CLASS SUPPLIES THE BASIS OF THE MOVEMENT OF ALL HUMANITY JUST AS A SIMILAR BELIEF IS NATURAL AND AGREEABLE
THAT HE COULD NOT FORBEAR STANDING WITHOUT THE DOOR FOR A MOMENT AS IF TO ENJOY THE TRIUMPH OF THE WARMTH WITHIN HIM OVER THE COLD MORNING AIR THE LITTLE STONE CHURCH
IT WAS NOT UNTIL NATHAN STODDARD HAD LOOKED FOR SOME LITTLE TIME UPON THIS SPECTACLE THAT HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE WAS WITNESS OF ANY THING MORE THAN NATURAL THE WHOLE PARTY HAD SO HOME LIKE AN AIR
THAT LED NATHAN STODDARD TO KEEP SECRET WHAT HE HAD WITNESSED BUT IT WAS LIKE SOME DEEP AND HOLY EXPERIENCE
IN RETURNING HOME HE HAD TO PASS ALONG THE RATHER UNFREQUENTED STREET WHICH RUNS IN THE REAR OF HIS CHURCH AND CLOSE TO IT AS HE WAS DRIVING RAPIDLY ALONG HIS EAR CAUGHT WHAT SEEMED THE PEAL OF AN ORGAN
AND FASTENED HIM TO A POST BEFORE THE DOOR THEN STEPPING TO THE SIDE OF THE SLEIGH HE SAID TO MISTER DUDLEY COME WITH ME SIR MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED UPON THE PALE FACE AND TREMBLING LIPS OF HIS PARISHIONER
AND FOLLOWED IN SILENCE NATHAN SPRANG UPON THE SHED AT THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH AND SCRAMBLED UP TO THE LITTLE WINDOW MISTER DUDLEY FOLLOWED AND WITH NATHAN'S HELP GAINED THE SAME PRECARIOUS FOOTHOLD LOOK IN SIR
HE WAS LEANING OVER THE GREAT BIBLE WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED UPON IT AND HIS EYES SEEMINGLY FILLED WITH TEARS OF PLEASURE AND GRATITUDE AND BENT UPON THE CHOIR MISTER DUDLEY LISTENED INTENTLY
BY THIS TIME THE SOUND OF A GATHERING CROWD BELOW WHICH HE HAD NOT HEEDED AT FIRST WAS FORCED MORE AND MORE UPON HIS NOTICE AND THE ANXIOUS VOICE OF HIS OLDEST DEACON CALLING MISTER DUDLEY MISTER DUDLEY
ROSE HIGH AND LOUD WHILE A GREAT THUNDERING AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CHURCH ANNOUNCED THAT THE PEOPLE BELOW HAD ALSO CAUGHT THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC AND WERE CLAMOROUS FOR ADMISSION
HAD BEEN FAIRLY DRESSED FOR CHRISTMAS BY SPIRIT HANDS WHEN MISTER DUDLEY REACHED HIS HOME AFTER THE WONDER HAD IN PART SPENT ITSELF HE FOUND THAT AN ENORMOUS CHRISTMAS PIE
HAD BEEN LEFT AT HIS DOOR BY A WHITE HAIRED OLD MAN DRESSED IN BLACK ABOUT SIX IN THE MORNING JUST AFTER HE HAD GONE TO VISIT HIS SICK PARISHIONER THE GIRL WHO RECEIVED IT REPORTED THE OLD MAN AS SAYING
AND THAT HE AVOWS THE INTENTION OF OBSERVING THE CHRISTMAS OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR WITH PUBLIC SERVICES UNLESS INDEED HE SHOULD BE ANTICIPATED BY HIS ANCIENT PREDECESSOR
THOUGH MOST OF THEM ARE COMPARATIVELY SHORT AS THEIR HIGHEST SOURCES LIE IN THE ICY SOLITUDES OF THE RANGE WITHIN FORTY OR FIFTY MILES OF THE COAST A FEW HOWEVER OF THESE FOAMING ROARING STREAMS
THEN CURVING SOUTHWARD AND RECEIVING NUMEROUS TRIBUTARIES FROM THE NORTH IT ENTERS THE COAST RANGE AND SWEEPS ACROSS IT THROUGH A MAGNIFICENT CANYON THREE THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND FEET DEEP
THE ROCKS ALSO AND THE GLACIERS SEEM TO BLOOM LIKE THE PLANTS IN THE MELLOW GOLDEN LIGHT AND SO GOES THE SONG CHANGE SUCCEEDING CHANGE IN SUBLIME HARMONY THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL SEASONS AND WEATHER
MY FIRST TRIP UP THE RIVER WAS MADE IN THE SPRING WITH THE MISSIONARY PARTY SOON AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AT WRANGELL WE LEFT WRANGELL IN THE AFTERNOON AND ANCHORED FOR THE NIGHT ABOVE THE RIVER DELTA
EIGHT THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA AND AS GLENORA IS ONLY A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
AND UP THE MOUNTAIN SLOPES OPEN IN SOME PLACES AND IN OTHERS THATCHED WITH DWARF FIRS RESTING A MINUTE HERE AND THERE TO REFRESH OURSELVES WITH HUCKLEBERRIES WHICH GREW IN ABUNDANCE IN OPEN SPOTS ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE SUNSET
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT INTERRUPTED BY SHEER PRECIPICES I CONCLUDED THAT WITH GREAT CARE AND THE DIGGING OF SLIGHT FOOTHOLDS HE COULD BE SLID DOWN TO THE GLACIER WHERE I COULD LAY HIM ON HIS BACK AND PERHAPS BE ABLE TO SET HIS ARMS
AND A LEAFY BED BESIDE IT I NOW TOLD HIM I WOULD RUN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN HASTEN BACK WITH HELP FROM THE BOAT AND CARRY HIM DOWN IN COMFORT BUT HE WOULD NOT HEAR OF MY LEAVING HIM NO NO HE SAID I CAN WALK DOWN DON'T LEAVE ME
I REMINDED HIM OF THE ROUGHNESS OF THE WAY HIS NERVE SHAKEN CONDITION AND ASSURED HIM I WOULD NOT BE GONE LONG BUT HE INSISTED ON TRYING
AT A CONSIDERABLE ANGLE I BRIEFLY EXPLAINED TO MISTER YOUNG'S COMPANIONS WHO STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT US THAT HE HAD BEEN HURT IN AN ACCIDENT AND REQUESTED ONE OF THEM TO ASSIST ME IN GETTING HIM ABOARD BUT STRANGE TO SAY INSTEAD OF COMING DOWN TO HELP
AT ONE TIME HIS TONE IN WRITING OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND HIS ALLUSIONS TO HIS MOTHER WON MY SYMPATHY AND RESPECT AT ANOTHER TIME THE PICTURE OF HIMSELF IN HIS LATER YEARS AND THE DEFIANT MANNER IN WHICH HE PRESENTED IT
THE POOR GIRL AS I WAS STILL INCLINED TO FEAR MIGHT HAVE SERIOUS REASON TO REGRET THAT HE HAD EVER ENTERED HER FATHER'S COTTAGE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE MY STEPMOTHER AND I MET AGAIN MISSUS ROYLAKE IN AN EXQUISITE MORNING DRESS WITH HER SMILE IN PERFECT ORDER
FOR ALL THAT TIME FOR SOME PART OF THE TIME I ANSWERED I WAS CATCHING MOTHS IN FORDWITCH WOOD
MY STEPMOTHER WAS HER CHARMING SELF AGAIN THE MOMENT MY QUESTION HAD PASSED MY LIPS SOCIETY PROVIDED IT WAS NOT SOCIETY AT THE MILL WAS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE AS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION YOUR ABSENCE WAS THE ONLY DRAWBACK SHE ANSWERED
EITHER I HAD FORGOTTEN LORD UPPERCLIFF DURING MY LONG ABSENCE ABROAD OR I HAD NEVER HEARD OF HIM
I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR ON THE ANCIENT SIDE OF THE BUILDING
ON THIS OLD SIDE OF THE HOUSE THERE'S FIRST DRAINS HE PROCEEDED TO RECKON UP THE REPAIRS COUNTING WITH HIS FLESHLESS THUMB ON HIS SKINNY FINGERS WHEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A CURIOUS SUCCESSION OF SOUNDS WHICH BEGAN WITH WHINING AND ENDED WITH SCRATCHING AT THE COTTAGE DOOR
MY LOYALTY TOWARDS THE AFFLICTED MAN WHOSE FRIENDLY ADVANCES I HAD SEEN GOOD REASON TO RETURN WAS IN NO SENSE SHAKEN HIS UNDESERVED MISFORTUNES HIS MANLY APPEAL TO ME AT THE SPRING
STILL WHILE CRISTEL'S ENTREATIES AND CRISTEL'S INFLUENCE HAD FAILED TO SHAKE ME GLOODY'S STRANGE LANGUAGE AND GLOODY'S INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT HAD TROUBLED MY MIND I FELT VAGUELY UNEASY IRRITATED BY MY OWN DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS
RETURNING TO THE HOUSE I TRIED TO OCCUPY MYSELF WITH MY COLLECTION OF INSECTS SADLY NEGLECTED OF LATE USELESS MY OWN MOTHS FAILED TO INTEREST ME I WENT BACK TO THE GARDEN PASSING THE OPEN WINDOW OF ONE OF THE LOWER ROOMS WHICH LOOKED OUT ON THE TERRACE
WHICH WAY DID I TURN MY STEPS MEN WILL WONDER WHAT POSSESSED ME WOMEN WILL THINK IT A PROCEEDING THAT DID ME CREDIT I TOOK THE FAMILIAR ROAD WHICH LED TO THE GLOOMY WOOD AND THE GUILTY RIVER THE LONGING IN ME TO SEE CRISTEL AGAIN WAS MORE THAN I COULD RESIST
OLD TOLLER WAS ALONE IN HIS KITCHEN EVIDENTLY ANNOYED AND ANGRY WE ARE ALL AT SIXES AND SEVENS MISTER GERARD I'VE HAD ANOTHER ROW WITH THAT DEAF DEVIL MY NEW NAME FOR HIM AND I THINK IT'S RATHER CLEVER
I'LL BE EVEN WITH HIM YOU MARK MY WORDS I'LL BE EVEN WITH HIM THAT OLD TOLLER THE MOST EXASPERATING OF MEN JUDGED BY A QUICK TEMPER HAD IRRITATED MY FRIEND INTO SPEAKING RASHLY WAS PLAIN ENOUGH NEVERTHELESS I FELT SOME ANXIETY
ABOUT CRISTEL AFTER LOOKING ROUND THE KITCHEN AGAIN I ASKED WHERE SHE WAS SITTING FORLORN IN HER BEDROOM CRYING HER FATHER TOLD ME I WENT OUT FOR A WALK BY THE RIVER AND I SAT DOWN AND BEING SUNDAY I FELL ASLEEP WHEN I WOKE AND GOT HOME AGAIN JUST NOW THAT
WAS HOW I FOUND HER I DON'T LIKE TO HEAR MY GIRL CRYING SHE'S AS GOOD AS GOLD AND BETTER NO SIR OUR DEAF DEVIL IS NOT TO BLAME FOR THIS HE HAS GIVEN CRISTY NO REASON TO COMPLAIN OF HIM SHE SAYS SO HERSELF AND SHE NEVER TOLD A LIE YET
OF MERCILESS CONDUCT OF SOME SORT ASSUMING THIS CONCLUSION TO BE THE RIGHT ONE I DETERMINED THEN AND THERE THAT LADY RACHEL SHOULD NOT PASS THE DOORS OF TRIMLEY DEEN AGAIN IF HER BOSOM FRIEND RESENTED THAT WISE ACT OF SEVERITY BY LEAVING THE HOUSE I SHOULD SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION
AND SHOULD REMEMBER THE CIRCUMSTANCE WITH PLEASURE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE ILL CRISTEL WAS ALL I COULD FIND TO SAY UNDER THE DOUBLE DISADVANTAGE OF SPEAKING THROUGH A DOOR AND HAVING A FATHER LISTENING AT MY SIDE OH NO MISTER GERARD NOT ILL
YOU'LL GET IT OUT OF CRISTY TO MORROW AND I'LL HELP YOU I FOUND GLOODY WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE HE WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT MISS CRISTEL HIS ONLY EXCUSE HE TOLD ME BEING THE FEAR THAT SHE MIGHT BE ILL HAVING SET HIM AT EASE IN THAT PARTICULAR I SAID
WHILE IT DIMMED THE TURBID EARTHY YELLOW THAT DISCOLORED AND DEGRADED THE STREAM UNDER THE FULL GLARE OF DAY WHILE MY EYES FOLLOWED THE SUCCESSIVE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE VIEW AS THE HOUR ADVANCED TENDER AND SOLEMN INFLUENCES BREATHED THEIR BALM OVER MY MIND
I THANKED THE LITTLE MILL GIRL AND GAVE HER A KISS DID I FEEL THE CHILD'S BREATH IN MY DAY DREAM STILL FLUTTERING ON MY CHEEK WAS I CONSCIOUS OF HER TOUCH I STARTED TREMBLED RETURNED RELUCTANTLY TO MY PRESENT SELF
I KNOW THAT SHE HAS VISITED YOU AND SPOKEN TO YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE HAS SAID I CAN GUESS
IF I HAVE MISBEHAVED MYSELF I DON'T RIGHTLY KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING OR DOING I POINTED TO THE NEW SIDE OF THE COTTAGE BEHIND US IS THE CAUSE THERE I ASKED NO NO INDEED
CRISTEL COUNTED THE STROKES SEVEN SHE SAID ARE YOU DETERMINED TO KEEP YOUR ENGAGEMENT SHE HAD REPEATED IN AN UNSTEADY VOICE AND WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE IN HER COLOR TO PALENESS THE STRANGE QUESTION PUT TO ME BY GLOODY
HIS BOOK OF LEAVES WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD HIM IN MY OWN HANDWRITING THAT I BELIEVED IN HIS BETTER NATURE
HE POINTED TO THE GRANDLY DARKENING VIEW THE TWO MEN WHO COULD HAVE PAINTED THE MYSTERY OF THOSE GROWING SHADOWS AND FADING LIGHTS LIE IN THE GRAVES OF REMBRANDT AND TURNER SHALL WE GO TO TEA ON OUR WAY TO HIS ROOM WE STOPPED AT THE MILLER'S DOOR
THE ROUGH RIDERS AT GUASIMAS ON THE DAY THE AMERICAN TROOPS LANDED ON THE COAST OF CUBA THE CUBANS INFORMED GENERAL WHEELER
ON EITHER SIDE ROSE BLACK OVERHANGING RIDGES
WE ADVANCED TALKING IN THAT FASHION AND IN HIGH SPIRITS AND CONGRATULATING OURSELVES IN BEING SHUT OF THE TRANSPORT AND ON BREATHING FINE MOUNTAIN AIR AGAIN
F AND E TROOPS WERE DEPLOYED IN SKIRMISH LINE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE FENCE WOOD HAD DISCOVERED THE ENEMY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE HE EXPECTED TO FIND HIM AND SO FAR FROM BEING SURPRISED HE HAD TIME
CAPRON COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE FIRED INTO US AT ANY TIME UNLESS HE HAD TURNED DIRECTLY AROUND IN HIS TRACKS AND AIMED UP THE VERY TRAIL HE HAD JUST DESCENDED
THEY COULD NOT SEE TWENTY FEET ON THREE SIDES OF THEM BUT ON THE RIGHT HAND LAY THE VALLEY AND ACROSS IT CAME THE SOUND OF YOUNG'S BRIGADE WHO WERE APPARENTLY HEAVILY ENGAGED
LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT RAN UP JUST THEN BRINGING WITH HIM LIEUTENANT WOODBURY KANE AND TEN TROOPERS FROM K TROOP ROOSEVELT LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS BESIDE LLEWELLYN AND CONSULTED WITH HIM EAGERLY
BUT WALKED ERECT STILL SMILING ROOSEVELT POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ADVANCE FARTHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE NETWORK OF WILD GRAPE VINES THAT MASKED THE SPANIARDS FROM US AND THAT WE MUST CROSS THE TRAIL
WAS NO MORE THAN A MAN COVERS IN SLIDING FOR A BASE AT OTHER TIMES HALF A TROOP WOULD RISE AND RACE FORWARD AND THEN BURROW DEEP IN THE HOT GRASS AND FIRE
THE WALK DOWN THAT TRAIL PRESENTED ONE OF THE MOST GREWSOME PICTURES OF THE WAR
SOME PLACE WHERE THERE IS SHADE AND A BREEZE
LARGE AND POWERFULLY BUILT HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE LEG JUST BELOW THE TRUNK AND I FOUND HIM LYING ON A BLANKET HALF NAKED AND COVERED WITH BLOOD AND WITH HIS LEG BOUND IN TOURNIQUETS MADE OF TWIGS AND POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS
GRAVE BOYISH FACES FILLED WITH SYMPATHY AND CONCERN ONLY FIFTY FEET FROM HIM AND FARTHER DOWN THE TRAIL I PASSED HIS CAPTAIN WITH HIS BODY PROPPED AGAINST CHURCH'S KNEE
A BOY WAS LYING WITH A BULLET WOUND BETWEEN HIS EYES HIS CHEST WAS HEAVING WITH SHORT HOARSE NOISES WHICH I GUESSED WERE DUE TO SOME MUSCULAR ACTION ENTIRELY AND THAT HE WAS VIRTUALLY DEAD
WAS WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE FARTHEST POINT
AS THOUGH WE WERE AT TARGET PRACTICE AND AN IRISH SERGEANT BYRNE WAS ASSISTING HIM BY KEEPING UP A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF COMMENTS AND CRITICISMS THAT SHOWED THE KEENEST ENJOYMENT OF THE SITUATION
AND THE FACT THAT OUR MEN COULD NOT SEE THEIR OPPONENTS THEIR OWN MEN FELL OR ROLLED OVER ON EVERY SIDE SHOT DOWN BY AN INVISIBLE ENEMY WITH NO ONE UPON WHOM THEY COULD RETALIATE
SOME OF THE MEN WHO WERE TWICE DAY'S AGE BEGGED HIM TO LET THEM TAKE THE ENEMY'S IMPROMPTU FORT ON THE RUN BUT HE ANSWERED THEM TOLERANTLY LIKE SPOILED CHILDREN AND HELD THEM DOWN UNTIL THERE WAS A LULL IN THE ENEMY'S FIRE
THE ENTRANCE TO HIS WOUND WAS SO SMALL THAT CHURCH COULD NOT INSERT ENOUGH OF THE GAUZE PACKING TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOOD I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO MAKE THIS HOLE LARGER HE SAID TO THE BOY OR YOU'LL BLEED TO DEATH
AND INTO A HUGE MEXICAN SADDLE HE STUCK HIS WOUNDED ANKLE INTO ONE STIRRUP AND HIS UNTOUCHED ONE INTO THE OTHER AND GATHERED UP THE REINS DOES IT PAIN YOU CAN YOU STAND IT
WHEN WE FIRED A VOLLEY ONE OF THE PRISONERS SAID LATER INSTEAD OF FALLING BACK THEY CAME FORWARD THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO FIGHT TO COME CLOSER AT EVERY VOLLEY
HIS STORY WOULD MAKE A FINE SONG ONE SAID AS STRONG AND AS BRAVE AND AS RED AS THOR ALWAYS IN A QUARREL A MAN OF MANY PLACES NORWAY THE NORTH OF ICELAND THE WEST OF ICELAND
ERIC STROLLED INTO HIS HOUSE AND CALLED FOR SUPPER WHEN THE DRINKING HORNS HAD BEEN FILLED AND EMPTIED ERIC PULLED HIMSELF UP AND SMILED AND SHOUTED OUT SO THAT THE GREAT ROOM WAS FULL OF HIS BIG VOICE
OUR SWORDS ARE SISTERS IN BLOOD AND WE ARE BROTHERS IN ADVENTURE DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN MY HEART TO DO HE JUMPED TO HIS FEET AND HIS FACE GLOWED THEN HE LAUGHED AS HE LOOKED AT HIS MEN
WHILE HE DRIFTED ABOUT HE SAW A STRANGE LAND THAT ROSE UP WHITE AND SHINING OUT OF A BLUE SEA HUGE SHIPS OF ICE SAILED OUT FROM IT AND MET HIM I MEAN TO SAIL TO THAT LAND
FOR HE LOVES YOU HUNTED LIKE A WOLF FROM CORNER TO CORNER OF THE WORLD ERIC CRIED ANGRILY WILL THEY NOT EVEN LET ME FINISH ONE FEAST THEN HE LAUGHED
BUT IF I TAKE MY SPORT LIKE A WOLF I MUST BE HUNTED LIKE ONE
IT MUST BE GIANTS THAT SAIL IN IT FROST GIANTS SAID ANOTHER OF THE MEN BUT AS THEY CAME NEARER
YONDER IS A STRANGE PILOT ERIC LAUGHED I HAVE SEEN BEARS COME FLOATING SO TO THE NORTH SHORE OF ICELAND AN OLD MAN SAID PERHAPS THEY COME FROM THE LAND THAT WE ARE GOING TO FIND ONE DAY ERIC SAID
AND ALL THE TIME I HEAR GREAT NOISES AS THOUGH SOME GIANT WERE BREAKING THIS LAND INTO PIECES AH CHEER UP GOOD WIFE ERIC LAUGHED I SMELL BETTER LUCK AHEAD
SOMETIMES THE SUN SHOWED FOR AN HOUR SOMETIMES FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES SOMETIMES IT DID NOT SHOW AT ALL FOR A WEEK THE MEN HUNTED BY THE BRIGHT SHINING OF THE MOON OR BY THE NORTHERN LIGHTS AS IT GREW WARMER
THE ICE IN THE SEA BEGAN TO CRACK AND MOVE AND MELT AND FLOAT AWAY ERIC WAITED ONLY UNTIL THERE WAS A CLEAR PASSAGE IN THE WATER THEN HE LAUNCHED HIS BOAT AND THEY SAILED SOUTHWARD AGAIN AT LAST THEY FOUND A PLACE THAT ERIC LIKED
I AM HUNGRY TO KNOW WHAT IS THERE THEN THEY ALL GOT INTO THE BOAT AGAIN AND SAILED NORTH WE CAN LEAVE NO ONE HERE ERIC HAD SAID WE CANNOT TELL WHAT MIGHT COME BETWEEN US PERHAPS GIANTS OR DRAGONS
IS DRY FOR MEAD THIS IS A BARE AND COLD AND HUNGRY LAND I WILL VISIT MY FRIENDS IN ICELAND AND OUR SWORDS ARE RUSTY WITH LONG RESTING SAID HIS MEN PERHAPS WE CAN FIND PLAY FOR THEM IN ICELAND
THE SEA IS FULL OF WHALE AND SEALS AND GREAT FISH HE SAID THE LAND HAS BEAR AND REINDEER THERE ARE NO MEN THERE COME BACK WITH ME AND CHOOSE YOUR LAND
IN THE SKY ABOVE I SEE FAIR ASGARD'S SHINING ROOFS THE FLYING HAIR OF THOR THE WINGS OF ODIN'S BIRDS THE ROAD THAT HEROES TREAD I AM HERE IN THE LAND OF THE GODS THE LAND OF MIGHTY MEN
FOR A WHILE HE WALKED THE LAND AS THOUGH HE WERE IN A DREAM HE LOOKED AT THIS AND THAT AND EVERYTHING
WHEN THE FEAST WAS OVER THE KING SAID YOU SHALL LIVE AT MY COURT THIS WINTER LEIF ERICSSON YOU ARE A WELCOME GUEST SO LEIF STAYED THERE THAT WINTER WHEN HE STARTED BACK IN THE SPRING
THEN GREAT WINDS CAME OUT OF THE NORTH AND TOSSED HIS SHIP ABOUT SO THAT THE MEN COULD DO NOTHING THEY WERE BLOWN SOUTH FOR DAYS AND DAYS THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE THEY WERE THEN THEY SAW LAND AND LEIF SAID
HE HAD LIVED WITH ERIC FOR MANY YEARS AND HAD TAKEN CARE OF LEIF WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY SO LEIF LOVED HIM NOW ONE DAY THEY HAD BEEN WANDERING ABOUT AND ALL CAME BACK TO CAMP AT NIGHT EXCEPT TYRKER WHEN LEIF LOOKED AROUND ON HIS COMRADES HE SAID
IT IS WONDERFUL LEIF SAID I HAVE HEARD TRAVELERS TELL OF SEEING GRAPES GROWING BUT I MYSELF NEVER SAW IT YOU SHALL TAKE US TO THEM EARLY IN THE MORNING TYRKER SO IN THE MORNING THEY WENT BACK INTO THE WOODS AND SAW THE GRAPES
THEY ATE OF THEM THEY ARE LIKE FOOD AND DRINK THEY CRIED THAT DAY LEIF SAID WE SPENT MOST OF THE SUMMER ON THE OCEAN WINTER WILL SOON BE COMING ON AND THE SEA ABOUT GREENLAND WILL BE FROZEN WE MUST START BACK
NOW HALF OF YOU SHALL GATHER GRAPES FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND THE OTHER HALF SHALL CUT TIMBER SO THEY DID AND AFTER A WEEK SAILED OFF THE SHIP WAS FULL OF LUMBER AND THEY TOWED THE ROWBOAT LOADED WITH GRAPES
THEN ALL THE MEN WAVED THEIR HANDS TO THE SHORE AND GAVE A GREAT SHOUT FOR THAT GOOD LAND FOR ALL THAT VOYAGE THEY HAD FAIR WEATHER AND SAILED INTO ERIC'S HARBOR BEFORE THE WINTER CAME
THORBIORN AND HIS DAUGHTER GUDRID THORSTEIN ANSWERED THEY LANDED HERE THIS SPRING I NEVER SAW OUR FATHER MORE GLAD OF ANYTHING THAN TO SEE THIS THORBIORN THEY WERE FRIENDS BEFORE WE LEFT ICELAND
WHEN THEY SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN THEY COULD NOT TALK ENOUGH OF OLD TIMES IN THE SPRING ERIC MEANS TO GIVE HIM A FARM UP THE FIORD A WAY IT SEEMS THAT THIS THORBIORN COMES OF A GOOD FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN RICH AND GREAT IN ICELAND FOR YEARS
WHEN THE BOAT WAS NEARING THE ISLAND OF MARKEN THE LITTLE YELLOW CHEESE HAD BEEN PRESENTED WITH ALL DUE FORMALITY TO ONE OF THE SAILORS WHO HAD BEEN SPECIALLY KIND IN THE MATTER OF SECURING GOOD SEATS FOR MISTER KING'S PARTY POLLY AND PHRONSIE HAVING HELD A WHISPERED CONFERENCE IN A RETIRED NOOK
TO COME OUT OF IT BRIGHT AND SMILING AND NOW IT HAS MADE TWO PEOPLE HAPPY PHRONSIE POLLY HAD SAID WHEN THE PRESENTATION WAS WELL OVER AND SHE ENDED UP WITH A KISS IT MADE ME HAPPY IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT OF ME AND THEN
CRIED JASPER COME POLLY AND PHRONSIE LET US TOSS THEM SOME WHIZ SPIN WENT THE COINS TO FALL INTO THE THICK STUBBY GRASS ON THE BANK
THE CHILDREN STOPPING THEIR SONG IN MID AIR SCRAMBLED AND SPRAWLED ALL OVER EACH OTHER IN THEIR EFFORTS TO SECURE THE COVETED MONEY SO JASPER AND POLLY THREW THE BITS NEXT TIME IN THE OTHER DIRECTION THEN THERE WAS A SHOUT AND A RUSH
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THIS TO THE LITTLE GIRL JASPER SHOUTED TO THEM AS THEY THREW COIN AFTER COIN
TAKE CARE POLLY YOU ALMOST STEPPED OFF BACKWARD DOWN THE BANK WARNED ADELA PULLING HER BACK AS THEY GOT OFF THE STEAMBOAT AND STOPPED A BIT TO LOOK AROUND
SAID POLLY SUCH A LITTLE BIT OF A WHILE DOESN'T COUNT WELL LET US TAKE PICTURES AS FAST AS WE CAN SUGGESTED JASPER AND THEN WHEN WE DO COME UP WITH ADELA WHY YOU'LL HAVE YOURS DONE SO POLLY ROUSED OUT OF HER DEJECTION AND SET TO WORK
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SPLENDID PICTURE NEVER MIND SAID JASPER YOU CAN CATCH THEM UNAWARES AND HAVE ANOTHER TRY AT THEM NOT SO GOOD AS THAT SAID POLLY SORROWFULLY WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED
SAID PHRONSIE AS POLLY AND JASPER RAN UP TO A DOORWAY THROUGH WHICH THEY COULD SEE THEIR PARTY PHRONSIE STOOD JUST INSIDE AND APPEARED TO BE WATCHING FOR THEM THERE'S A WOMAN HERE WHO'S BEEN SHOWING US THINGS
SHE CONFIDED TO JASPER WHEN ONCE OUT OF DOORS HOW ELSE COULD THEY BE PULLED SO TIGHT AND THEY LOOK AS HARD AS A DRUM I DIDN'T INVESTIGATE HE SAID LAUGHING I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU POLLY WELL IT'S FUNNY ANYWAY SHE SAID
AND THOSE EMBROIDERED JACKETS OVER THEIR WAISTS AND THOSE CAPS AND HORRIBLE POT HOOKS AND LONG CURLS IT'S WELL THAT WE'VE GOT SO MANY PICTURES FOR THE PEOPLE AT HOME WOULD NEVER BELIEVE OUR STORIES WITHOUT THEM
WHY MISTER CROPPER CHANGED HIS MIND WELL MISS MAXWELL HOW DID YOU GET ALONG TODAY ASKED MISTER BAXTER AFFABLY WHEN THE NEW TEACHER CAME TO THE TABLE SHE WAS A SLIGHT DARK GIRL RATHER PLAIN LOOKING
BUT SHE WAS A CAPABLE GIRL AND HAD NO DOUBT OF HER OWN ABILITY TO GET AND KEEP THE SCHOOL IN GOOD WORKING ORDER SHE SMILED BRIGHTLY AT MISTER BAXTER VERY WELL FOR A BEGINNING THE CHILDREN SEEM BRIGHT AND TEACHABLE
WELL MISS MAXWELL I THINK IT ONLY FAIR TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE WITH THOSE BOYS WHEN THEY DO COME FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED YOU KNOW MISTER CROPPER WAS OPPOSED TO OUR HIRING YOU
I DON'T SUPPOSE POOR MISSUS CHARLEY WILL GET ONE OF THEM ANY MORE THAN SHE EVER HAS SAID MISSUS BAXTER INDIGNANTLY IT'S A BURNING SHAME THAT'S WHAT IT IS I JUST WISH SHE COULD CATCH THE CROPPERS ONCE
YOU HAVEN'T ANY PROOF THAT IT IS REALLY THEM MARY OBJECTED HER HUSBAND AND YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE RECKLESS ACCUSATIONS BEFORE FOLKS I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS THEM
THEY NEVER GOT ON WELL TOGETHER AND WHEN CHARLEY DIED THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS FUSS ABOUT THE PROPERTY ISAAC ACTED MEAN AND SCANDALOUS CLEAR THROUGH AND PUBLIC OPINION HAS BEEN DOWN ON HIM EVER SINCE
SHE HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET A SCRAP OF PROOF AS TO WHO TOOK THEM OR SHE'D MAKE IT HOT FOR THEM BUT NOBODY IN MAITLAND HAS ANY DOUBT IN HIS OWN MIND THAT ISAAC CROPPER KNOWS WHERE THOSE PLUMS GO
I DON'T THINK MISTER CROPPER WOULD STEAL PROTESTED ESTHER WELL HE DOESN'T CONSIDER IT STEALING YOU KNOW HE CLAIMS THE LAND AND SAYS THE PLUMS ARE HIS
WHEN QUESTIONED EVERY PUPIL DENIED HAVING DONE OR HELPED TO DO IT ALFRED AND BOB CROPPER LOOKED HER SQUARELY IN THE EYES AND DECLARED THEIR INNOCENCE IN THEIR USUAL GENTLEMANLY FASHION YET ESTHER FELT SURE THAT THEY WERE THE GUILTY ONES
I HAVE COME UP TO SEE YOU ABOUT ALFRED AND ROBERT MISTER CROPPER SHE SAID THEY ARE NOT BEHAVING WELL IN SCHOOL INDEED MISTER CROPPER'S VOICE EXPRESSED BLAND SURPRISE THAT IS STRANGE
ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY ESTHER WENT FOR AN AFTERNOON WALK CARRYING HER KODAK WITH HER IT WAS A BRILLIANTLY FINE AUTUMN DAY AND WOODS AND FIELDS WERE BASKING IN A MELLOW HAZE ESTHER WENT ACROSS LOTS TO MISSUS CHARLEY CROPPER'S HOUSE INTENDING TO MAKE A CALL
BUT THE HOUSE WAS LOCKED UP AND EVIDENTLY DESERTED SO SHE RAMBLED PAST IT TO THE BACK FIELDS PASSING THROUGH A GROVE OF MAPLES SHE CAME OUT AMONG LEAFY YOUNG SAPLINGS ON THE OTHER SIDE JUST BEYOND HER WITH ITS LADEN BOUGHS HANGING OVER THE LINE FENCE
HAVING LOST THEIR LEADERS WERE SOON QUELLED COMPLAINT DIED AWAY AND AT THE END OF THE TERM ESTHER WAS RE ENGAGED YOU SEEM TO HAVE WON OLD CROPPER OVER TO YOUR SIDE ENTIRELY MISTER BAXTER TOLD HER THAT NIGHT
NEITHER AT THIS END OR THAT BUT LIKE A PRODIGAL'S CANDLE TO LIGHT HIM IF POSSIBLE AT BOTH ENDS AT ONCE NOW THROUGH ALL THE LUMBER ROOMS OF MILITARY FURNITURE INCLUDING BOTH OF HORSE AND FOOT
TIS ONE OF THE NUMBER OF THOSE MANY THINGS WHICH A MAN HAD BETTER DO OVER AGAIN THAN DISPUTE ABOUT IT THAT WHATEVER TOWN OR FORTRESS THE CORPORAL WAS AT WORK UPON DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR CAMPAIGN MY UNCLE TOBY ALWAYS TOOK CARE ON THE INSIDE OF HIS SENTRY BOX
UNDER ONE PRETENCE OR OTHER BUT GENERALLY THAT OF POINTING MORE DISTINCTLY AT SOME REDOUBT OR BREASTWORK IN THE MAP SHE WOULD EFFECT BEFORE MY UNCLE TOBY POOR SOUL HAD WELL MARCH'D ABOVE HALF A DOZEN TOISES WITH IT IT OBLIGED MY UNCLE TOBY TO MAKE USE OF HIS FOREFINGER
WITHOUT ANY EFFECT FOR AS THERE WAS NO ARTERIAL OR VITAL HEAT IN THE END OF THE TOBACCO PIPE IT COULD EXCITE NO SENTIMENT IT COULD NEITHER GIVE FIRE BY PULSATION OR RECEIVE IT BY SYMPATHY
WHICH SLIGHTLY PRESS'D AGAINST THE CALF OF HIS
IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO BE A LITTLE MORE EXACT IN MY DESCRIPTIONS OF THEM AS I COME UP TO THEM WHICH WILL NOT BE FOR SOME CHAPTERS HAVING NOTHING MORE TO ADD IN THIS BUT THAT IN A BUNDLE OF ORIGINAL PAPERS AND DRAWINGS WHICH MY FATHER TOOK CARE TO ROLL UP BY THEMSELVES
THERE IS A PLAN OF BOUCHAIN IN PERFECT PRESERVATION AND SHALL BE KEPT SO WHILST I HAVE POWER TO PRESERVE ANY THING UPON THE LOWER CORNER OF WHICH ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THERE IS STILL REMAINING THE MARKS OF A SNUFFY FINGER AND THUMB
I THINK SO TOO REPLIED MY UNCLE TOBY WITH A SIGH HALF SUPPRESS'D BUT STEP INTO THE PARLOUR TRIM FOR THE STIPULATION IT LIES UPON THE TABLE IT HAS LAIN THERE THESE SIX WEEKS REPLIED THE CORPORAL TILL THIS VERY MORNING THAT THE OLD WOMAN KINDLED THE FIRE WITH IT
IT WAS A THOUSAND PITIES THOUGH I BELIEVE AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR
WAS A THOUSAND PITIES AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR TO DESTROY THESE WORKS
THEY ARE ALL TRUE FOR THEY ARE ABOUT MYSELF I DO NOT LIKE THE SUBJECT THE WORSE TRIM SAID MY UNCLE TOBY ON THAT SCORE BUT PRITHEE WHAT IS THIS STORY THOU HAST EXCITED MY CURIOSITY
HE AS THE CORPORAL WAS ENTERING THE CONFINES OF BOHEMIA MY UNCLE TOBY OBLIGED HIM TO HALT FOR A SINGLE MOMENT HE HAD SET OUT BARE HEADED HAVING SINCE HE PULL'D OFF HIS MONTERO CAP IN THE LATTER END OF THE LAST CHAPTER LEFT IT LYING BESIDE HIM ON THE GROUND
WITHOUT FURTHER ATTEMPTING IT HE PUT IT ON AND PASSING HIS HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD TO RUB OUT A PENSIVE WRINKLE WHICH THE TEXT AND THE DOCTRINE BETWEEN THEM HAD ENGENDER'D HE RETURN'D WITH THE SAME LOOK AND TONE OF VOICE TO HIS STORY OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA AND HIS SEVEN CASTLES
AND ALL ITS ABYSSES AT HIS FEET BUT AS MODESTY SCARCE TOUCHES WITH A FINGER WHAT LIBERALITY OFFERS HER WITH BOTH HANDS OPEN THE CORPORAL CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH THE VERY WORST YEAR OF THE WHOLE BUNCH WHICH TO PREVENT YOUR HONOURS OF THE MAJORITY AND MINORITY
WHICH BEING THE YEAR OF OUR LORD SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND TWELVE WHEN THE DUKE OF ORMOND WAS PLAYING THE DEVIL IN FLANDERS THE CORPORAL TOOK IT AND SET OUT WITH IT AFRESH ON HIS EXPEDITION TO BOHEMIA THE STORY OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA AND HIS SEVEN CASTLES CONTINUED
THERE WAS AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR TO TELL THEE TRULY TRIM QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY ANY OTHER DATE WOULD HAVE PLEASED ME MUCH BETTER NOT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE SAD STAIN UPON OUR HISTORY THAT YEAR
THOUGH FAGEL WAS CARRYING ON THE WORKS WITH SUCH INCREDIBLE VIGOUR BUT LIKEWISE ON THE SCORE TRIM OF THY OWN STORY BECAUSE IF THERE ARE AND WHICH FROM WHAT THOU HAST DROPT I PARTLY SUSPECT TO BE THE FACT IF THERE ARE GIANTS IN IT
UNLESS ONE IS PRETTY SURE OF EM SURE OF EM SAID THE CORPORAL SHAKING HIS HEAD RIGHT ANSWERED MY UNCLE TOBY IT IS NOT EASY TRIM FOR ONE BRED UP AS THOU AND I HAVE BEEN TO ARMS WHO SELDOM LOOKS FURTHER FORWARD THAN TO THE END OF HIS MUSKET OR BACKWARDS BEYOND HIS KNAPSACK
HE HAS HIS FIRELOCK AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR TO FURBISH HIS ACCOUTREMENTS TO TAKE CARE OF HIS REGIMENTALS TO MEND
WHAT BUSINESS ADDED THE CORPORAL TRIUMPHANTLY HAS A SOLDIER AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR TO KNOW ANY THING AT ALL OF GEOGRAPHY THOU WOULD'ST HAVE SAID CHRONOLOGY TRIM SAID MY UNCLE TOBY FOR AS FOR GEOGRAPHY
TIS OF ABSOLUTE USE TO HIM HE MUST BE ACQUAINTED INTIMATELY WITH EVERY COUNTRY AND ITS BOUNDARIES WHERE HIS PROFESSION CARRIES HIM HE SHOULD KNOW EVERY TOWN AND CITY AND VILLAGE AND HAMLET WITH THE CANALS THE ROADS AND HOLLOW WAYS WHICH LEAD UP TO THEM
HE SHOULD KNOW THEIR PRODUCE THEIR PLANTS THEIR MINERALS THEIR WATERS THEIR ANIMALS THEIR SEASONS THEIR CLIMATES THEIR HEATS AND COLD
THAT OF ALL OTHERS IT SEEMS A SCIENCE WHICH THE SOLDIER MIGHT BEST SPARE WAS IT NOT FOR THE LIGHTS WHICH THAT SCIENCE MUST ONE DAY GIVE HIM IN DETERMINING THE INVENTION OF POWDER THE FURIOUS EXECUTION OF WHICH RENVERSING EVERY THING LIKE THUNDER BEFORE IT
AND THAT THE CHINESE ADDED MY UNCLE TOBY EMBARRASS US AND ALL ACCOUNTS OF IT STILL MORE BY BOASTING OF THE INVENTION SOME HUNDREDS OF YEARS EVEN BEFORE HIM THEY ARE A PACK OF LIARS I BELIEVE CRIED TRIM THEY ARE SOMEHOW OR OTHER DECEIVED SAID MY UNCLE TOBY IN THIS MATTER
YET THE MANY INTERRUPTIONS HE HAD GIVEN DWELT NOT SO STRONG UPON HIS FANCY AS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EPITHET WAS HE UNFORTUNATE THEN TRIM SAID MY UNCLE TOBY PATHETICALLY THE CORPORAL WISHING FIRST THE WORD AND ALL ITS SYNONIMAS AT THE DEVIL
WHICH MIGHT HAPPEN OR NOT JUST AS CHANCE ORDERED IT KING WILLIAM WAS OF AN OPINION AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR QUOTH TRIM THAT EVERY THING WAS PREDESTINED FOR US IN THIS WORLD
OVER HEAD AND EARS AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR PRITHEE WHEN WHERE AND HOW CAME IT TO PASS I NEVER HEARD ONE WORD OF IT BEFORE QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY I DARE SAY ANSWERED TRIM
GALLANT MORTAL CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY CAUGHT UP WITH ENTHUSIASM THIS MOMENT NOW THAT ALL IS LOST I SEE HIM GALLOPING ACROSS ME CORPORAL TO THE LEFT TO BRING UP THE REMAINS OF THE ENGLISH HORSE ALONG WITH HIM TO SUPPORT THE RIGHT
THEN WHEELING ABOUT AND CHARGING CONTI AT THE HEAD OF IT BRAVE BRAVE BY HEAVEN CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY HE DESERVES A CROWN AS RICHLY AS A THIEF A HALTER SHOUTED TRIM MY UNCLE TOBY KNEW THE CORPORAL'S LOYALTY
WHICH HAD RUN ON IN FRONT STARTED TWO PHEASANTS HE HAD HARDLY STEPPED AMONG THE BRIERS WHEN THE PHEASANTS BEGAN TO RISE AT EVERY STEP THE OLD MAN HAD NOT SHOWN HIM THAT PLACE THE DAY BEFORE AS HE MEANT TO KEEP IT FOR SHOOTING FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN
NOW SEEMED PLEASANT AFTER GOING ROUND THE PLACE WHERE YESTERDAY THEY HAD FOUND THE ANIMAL AND NOT FINDING ANYTHING HE FELT INCLINED TO REST
AN OLD STAG A BEAUTIFUL STAG WHO PERHAPS HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN AND IN A PLACE WHERE NO HUMAN BEING HAS EVER SAT OR THOUGHT THESE THOUGHTS HERE I SIT AND AROUND ME STAND OLD AND YOUNG TREES
AND WIPED THE WARM BLOOD OFF HIS HAND ONTO HIS COAT PERHAPS THE JACKALS SCENT THEM AND WITH DISSATISFIED FACES GO OFF IN ANOTHER DIRECTION ABOVE ME
HE REMEMBERED THE ABREKS AND THE MURDERS HE HAD BEEN TOLD ABOUT AND HE EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT THAT AN ABREK WOULD SPRING FROM BEHIND EVERY BUSH AND HE WOULD HAVE TO DEFEND HIS LIFE AND DIE OR BE A COWARD HE THOUGHT OF GOD
AND OF THE FUTURE LIFE AS FOR LONG HE HAD NOT THOUGHT ABOUT THEM AND ALL AROUND WAS THAT SAME GLOOMY STERN WILD NATURE AND IS IT WORTH WHILE LIVING FOR ONESELF THOUGHT HE
SUDDENLY IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SUN HAD SHONE INTO HIS SOUL HE HEARD RUSSIAN BEING SPOKEN AND ALSO HEARD THE RAPID SMOOTH FLOW OF THE TEREK AND A FEW STEPS FARTHER IN FRONT OF HIM SAW THE BROWN MOVING SURFACE OF THE RIVER
WAS CALM AND MAJESTIC AS A KING HIS FACE WAS VERY LIKE THAT OF THE DEAD ABREK HE DID NOT DEIGN TO LOOK AT ANYONE AND NEVER ONCE GLANCED AT THE DEAD BODY BUT SITTING ON HIS HEELS IN THE SHADE HE SPAT AS HE SMOKED HIS SHORT PIPE
BUT INSTEAD OF BEING RED HAIRED HE WAS BLACK HAIRED RESTLESS WITH EXTREMELY WHITE GLEAMING TEETH AND SPARKLING BLACK EYES THE SCOUT WILLINGLY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION AND ASKED FOR A CIGARETTE THERE WERE FIVE BROTHERS
IT WAS AS IF THESE COSSACKS WERE PLAYING AT BEING SOLDIERS BUT THESE FORMALITIES SOON GAVE PLACE TO ORDINARY WAYS OF BEHAVIOUR AND THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS A SMART COSSACK JUST LIKE THE OTHERS BEGAN SPEAKING FLUENTLY IN TARTAR TO THE INTERPRETER
THEY FILLED IN SOME DOCUMENT GAVE IT TO THE SCOUT AND RECEIVED FROM HIM SOME MONEY THEN THEY APPROACHED THE BODY WHICH OF YOU IS LUKE GAVRILOV
I HAVE REPORTED YOUR EXPLOIT TO THE COMMANDER I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL COME OF IT I HAVE RECOMMENDED YOU FOR A CROSS YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE MADE A SERGEANT CAN YOU READ I CAN'T BUT WHAT A FINE FELLOW TO LOOK AT SAID THE CAPTAIN
WHEN THE BODY HAD BEEN CARRIED TO THE SKIFF THE BROTHER CHECHEN DESCENDED TO THE BANK THE COSSACKS INVOLUNTARILY STEPPED ASIDE TO LET HIM PASS HE JUMPED INTO THE BOAT AND PUSHED OFF FROM THE BANK WITH HIS POWERFUL LEG AND NOW
THE CHECHEN LOOKED AT HIM AND TURNING SLOWLY AWAY GAZED AT THE OPPOSITE BANK THAT LOOK EXPRESSED NOT HATRED BUT COLD CONTEMPT HE AGAIN MADE SOME REMARK WHAT IS HE SAYING OLENIN ASKED OF THE FIDGETY SCOUT
MOUNTED AND RODE AT A FOOT PACE ALONG THE ROAD PAST A TARTAR VILLAGE FROM WHICH A CROWD CAME OUT TO LOOK AT THEM THE COSSACKS ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE OF THE RIVER WERE HIGHLY SATISFIED AND JOVIAL LAUGHTER AND JOKES WERE HEARD ON ALL SIDES
LOOK THERE NOW THE MOUNTAINS ARE NOT FAR OFF CONTINUED LUKASHKA YET YOU CAN'T GET THERE HOW WILL YOU GET BACK ALONE IT'S GETTING DARK I'LL TAKE YOU IF YOU LIKE YOU ASK THE CORPORAL TO GIVE ME LEAVE WHAT A FINE FELLOW
THOUGHT OLENIN LOOKING AT THE COSSACK'S BRIGHT FACE
SOMETHING AKIN TO LOVE MADE ITSELF FELT BETWEEN THESE TWO VERY DIFFERENT YOUNG MEN EVERY TIME THEY GLANCED AT ONE ANOTHER THEY WANTED TO LAUGH BY WHICH GATE DO YOU ENTER ASKED OLENIN
BY THE MIDDLE ONE BUT I'LL SEE YOU AS FAR AS THE MARSH AFTER THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR OLENIN LAUGHED
IT'S ALL RIGHT WHAT HAVE I TO DO AND HOW CAN YOU HELP BEING AFRAID EVEN WE ARE AFRAID SAID LUKASHKA TO SET OLENIN'S SELF ESTEEM AT REST AND HE LAUGHED TOO THEN COME IN WITH ME WE'LL HAVE A TALK AND A DRINK AND IN THE MORNING YOU CAN GO BACK
COULDN'T I FIND A PLACE TO SPEND THE NIGHT LAUGHED LUKASHKA BUT THE CORPORAL ASKED ME TO GO BACK I HEARD YOU SINGING LAST NIGHT AND ALSO SAW YOU EVERY ONE AND LUKE SWAYED HIS HEAD IS IT TRUE YOU ARE GETTING MARRIED ASKED OLENIN
MOTHER WANTS ME TO MARRY BUT I HAVE NOT GOT A HORSE YET AREN'T YOU IN THE REGULAR SERVICE OH DEAR NO I'VE ONLY JUST JOINED AND HAVE NOT GOT A HORSE YET AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET ONE THAT'S WHY THE MARRIAGE DOES NOT COME OFF
I HAVE A HUNDRED HORSES WORTH THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED RUBLES EACH BUT THEY ARE NOT LIKE YOURS THEY ARE TROTTERS YOU KNOW BUT STILL I LIKE THE HORSES HERE BEST WELL AND DID YOU COME HERE OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL OR WERE YOU SENT SAID LUKASHKA
LAUGHING AT HIM LOOK THAT'S WHERE YOU LOST YOUR WAY HE ADDED YOU SHOULD HAVE TURNED TO THE RIGHT I CAME BY MY OWN WISH REPLIED OLENIN I WANTED TO SEE YOUR PARTS AND TO JOIN SOME EXPEDITIONS I WOULD GO ON AN EXPEDITION ANY DAY SAID LUKASHKA
THE WIND HOWLED THROUGH THE TREE TOPS THE JACKALS SUDDENLY SEEMED TO BE CRYING CLOSE BESIDE THEM HOWLING CHUCKLING AND SOBBING BUT AHEAD OF THEM IN THE VILLAGE THE SOUNDS OF WOMEN'S VOICES AND THE BARKING OF DOGS COULD ALREADY BE HEARD
THE OUTLINES OF THE HUTS WERE CLEARLY TO BE SEEN LIGHTS GLEAMED AND THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH THE PECULIAR SMELL OF KISYAK SMOKE OLENIN FELT KEENLY THAT NIGHT ESPECIALLY THAT HERE IN THIS VILLAGE WAS HIS HOME HIS FAMILY
AND GAVE IT TO LUKASHKA WHY SHOULD YOU GIVE ME A PRESENT SAID LUKASHKA I HAVE NOT YET DONE ANYTHING FOR YOU REALLY IT IS NOTHING ANSWERED OLENIN TAKE IT AND YOU WILL GIVE ME A PRESENT AND WE'LL GO ON AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE ENEMY TOGETHER LUKASHKA BECAME CONFUSED
AND IT WAS LATE WHEN LUKASHKA NOT TIPSY HE NEVER WAS TIPSY BUT HAVING DRUNK A GOOD DEAL LEFT OLENIN AFTER SHAKING HANDS OLENIN LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD DO
SO LONG AS SHE SPOKE GRACIOUSLY TO HIM HE THOUGHT SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM LONG CONTINUED ANXIETY ABOUT HER MOTHER OR THAT SHE HAD TOO MUCH TO DO AND EITHER CAUSE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM TREAT HER WITH A GRAVE REGARD AND DEFERENCE WHICH HAD A REPRESSED TENDERNESS IN IT
TO SPEND A FORTNIGHT WITH A KINDLY NEIGHBOUR WHO LIVED NEAR THE FARM THEY HAD OCCUPIED FORTY MILES OR SO INLAND BEFORE THEY CAME TO HAYTERSBANK THE WIDOW WOMAN WAS TO COME AND STAY IN THE HOUSE TO KEEP SYLVIA COMPANY DURING HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE
DANIEL INDEED WAS TO RETURN HOME AFTER CONVEYING HIS WIFE TO HER DESTINATION BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE DONE ON THE LAND AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THAT SYLVIA WOULD HAVE BEEN ALONE ALL DAY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ARRANGEMENT JUST MENTIONED
BUT IT THUS HAPPENED THAT THEY DID NOT GIVE THE PROMPT ASSISTANCE THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO RENDER AT SUCH TIMES AND COULSON HAD BEEN AWAY ON SOME OF THE NEW EXPEDITIONS DEVOLVING ON HIM AND PHILIP AS FUTURE PARTNERS
I WISH I'D SEEN HIM SAID COULSON
IT WAS REDD UP FOR THE AFTERNOON COVERED WITH A BLACK MASS OF COAL OVER WHICH THE EQUALLY BLACK KETTLE HUNG ON THE CROOK IN THE BACK KITCHEN DOLLY REID SYLVIA'S ASSISTANT DURING HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE CHANTED A LUGUBRIOUS DITTY BEFITTING HER CONDITION AS A WIDOW
I SHALL GO TO SEA HAPPY NOW THINKING I'VE YO'R WORD YO'RE NOT ONE TO GO BACK FROM IT I'M SURE ELSE IT'S A LONG TIME TO LEAVE SUCH A PRETTY GIRL AS YO AND NE'ER A CHANCE OF A LETTER REACHING YO JUST TO TELL YO ONCE AGAIN HOW I LOVE YO
AND THERE'S YON TALL FELLOW OF A COUSIN AS LOOKS BLACK AT ME
HE'S A NOTION OF BEING SWEET ON YO HISSELF NOT HE SAID SYLVIA WITH SOME CONTEMPT IN HER TONE
OF THE NUMBER OF LETTERS THAT ARRIVED IN MONKSHAVEN THE FOSTERS SHOPKEEPERS AND BANKERS HAD THE LARGEST SHARE THE MORNING SUCCEEDING THE DAY ON WHICH SYLVIA HAD ENGAGED HERSELF TO KINRAID THE FOSTERS SEEMED UNUSUALLY ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN THEIR LETTERS
AND WERE PERHAPS AS FULL OF CONSIDERATION AS TO THE POSSIBLE CONTENTS OF THIS LONDON LETTER
THE LATTER WAS SILENT BROODING OVER THE CONFIDENCE WHICH PHILIP HAD APPARENTLY RECEIVED BUT WHICH WAS WITHHELD FROM HIM HE DID NOT YET KNOW OF THE CULMINATING POINT OF PHILIP'S PROPOSED JOURNEY TO LONDON
AS THEY ALL SAT AT TEA IN ALICE ROSE'S HOUSE PLACE PHILIP ANNOUNCED HIS INTENDED JOURNEY
SAID COULSON HE'S SENT FOR
WHAT'S TO DO HESTER SAID HE SHE LIFTED UP THOSE EYES USUALLY SO SOFT AND SERENE NOW THEY WERE FULL OF THE LIGHT OF INDIGNATION SHINING THROUGH TEARS TO DO SHE SAID COULSON I'D THOUGHT BETTER OF THEE
GOING AND DOUBTING AND ENVYING PHILIP AS NIVER DID THEE AN ILL TURN OR SAID AN ILL WORD OR THOUGHT AN ILL THOUGHT BY THEE AND SENDING HIM AWAY OUT O T HOUSE THIS LAST NIGHT OF ALL
AND YET HE WAS REPROACHED FOR THE COURSE IT WAS TAKING
AND TILL HE HAD PATIENTLY WITH LONG CONTINUING AND DEEP AFFECTION WORKED HIS WAY INTO HER REGARD WAS SET ASIDE DURING THE PRESENT WALK HE WOULD SPEAK TO HER OF HIS PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR AN UNCERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND THE CERTAIN DISTANCE OF LONDON
AND ALL THE MODIFICATION ON THIS POINT WHICH HIS JUDGMENT COULD OBTAIN FROM HIS IMPETUOUS AND EXCITED HEART WAS THAT HE WOULD WATCH HER WORDS AND MANNER WELL WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS APPROACHING ABSENCE AND IF IN THEM HE READ THE SLIGHTEST TOKEN OF TENDER REGRETFUL FEELING
AND CONVINCED OF HER GREAT LOVE TOWARDS HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN ANY PREVIOUS JEALOUSY OF PHILIP SECURE AND EXULTANT HIS BROAD HANDSOME WEATHER BRONZED FACE WAS AS GREAT A CONTRAST TO PHILIP'S LONG THOUGHTFUL SALLOW COUNTENANCE
BEFORE GOING TO SEA SAID PHILIP HALF SMILING NA
AND SAIL FOR THE NORTH SEAS DAY AFTER HE TURNED AWAY AND BEGAN TO WHISTLE AS IF HE DID NOT WISH FOR ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH HIS INTERROGATOR PHILIP INDEED HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO HIM HE HAD LEARNED ALL HE WANTED TO KNOW I'D LIKE TO BID GOOD BY TO SYLVIE IS SHE AT HOME HE ASKED OF HER FATHER
SO THEY PARTED BUT PHILIP HAD NOT GONE MANY STEPS BEFORE HIS UNCLE CALLED HIM BACK KINRAID SLOWLY LOITERING ON MEANWHILE
AND SHE HAD COVERTLY WATCHED THEM UP THE BROW IN THE FIELD SHE SATE DOWN TO MEDITATE AND DREAM ABOUT HER GREAT HAPPINESS IN BEING BELOVED BY HER HERO CHARLEY KINRAID NO GLOOMY DREAD OF HIS LONG SUMMER'S ABSENCE NO FEAR OF THE COLD
THAT SHE WHOM HE LOVED HAD ASKED HIM TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND HE HAD NEGLECTED IT SO ANXIOUS TO BE EXCUSED AND FORGIVEN HE WENT ON WITH THE APOLOGY SHE CARED NOT TO HEAR IF SHE HAD BEEN LESS OCCUPIED WITH HER OWN AFFAIRS LESS ENGROSSED WITH DEEP FEELING
HE PAUSED A LITTLE SYLVIA'S GALLOPING THOUGHTS WERE PULLED SUDDENLY UP BY HIS SILENCE SHE FELT THAT HE WANTED HER TO SAY SOMETHING BUT SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BESIDES AN AMBIGUOUS WELL
SUDDENLY A LIGHT SHONE DOWN INTO PHILIP'S MIND HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED AS HE SPOKE NEXT
AND TOUCHED HER PRIDE MAYBE TOO
HAD JESUS OF NAZARETH BEEN WILLING TO BECOME THEIR EARTHLY KING AND TO LEAD THE NATION AGAINST THE ROMANS THE JEWS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOLLOWED HIM TO A MAN
THE SAVIOUR SOUGHT TO HEAL IT HE CALLED OUT THE FAITH AND GRATITUDE OF THE ROMAN CENTURION AND HIS ANSWER TO THE JEWISH LEADERS RENDER TO CAESAR THE THINGS THAT ARE CAESAR'S
YET THE KEENER THE SUFFERING THE MORE DESPERATE THE JEWS BECAME THEIR WHOLE SOULS WERE POSSESSED WITH A WILD AND MAD PASSION FOR REVENGE
WHERE THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WERE QUARTERED AND CRIED OUT TO THE GARRISON WITHIN THAT THEIR LIVES SHOULD BE SPARED IF THEY WOULD LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS THE ROMAN SOLDIERS HESITATED BUT THE JEWS PROMISED MOST FAITHFULLY TO KEEP THEIR WORD
AND HE SENT A GREAT ARMY AGAINST JERUSALEM THE JEWS SHUT THE GATES OF THEIR CITY AND SO BEGAN THE AWFUL SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND WHEN YE SHALL SEE JERUSALEM COMPASSED WITH ARMIES
AS ONE BY ONE THEIR DEFENCES FELL AND THE END DREW NEAR THEN FOOD FAILED IN THE CITY MEN FOUGHT LIKE DEMONS IN THE STREETS FOR A TINY LOAF OF BARLEY BREAD SO FRANTIC WERE THE PEOPLE WITH HUNGER
HARD MERCILESS AS WAS THE ROMAN GENERAL EVEN HE GREW SICK WITH HORROR AT LAST AND HE SENT HIS JEWISH PRISONER JOSEPHUS TO THE JEWS PROMISING THEM THEIR LIVES IF THEY WOULD GIVE UP THE CITY
AH MY COUNTRYMEN HE CRIED WE DID NOTHING WITHOUT GOD IN THE PAST BUT NOW YOU ARE FIGHTING AGAINST HIM HAD GOD JUDGED YOU WORTHY OF FREEDOM HE WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THE ROMANS AS HE DID THE ASSYRIANS LONG AGO
PILLARS FELL BEAMS CRUMBLED TO ASHES WHILE ROUND THE ALTAR OF SACRIFICE THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM LAY HEAPED TOGETHER SLAIN IN SUCH NUMBERS IN THE HOLY PLACE THAT THEIR BLOOD FLOWED DOWN THE BROAD MARBLE STEPS IN A HEAVY CRIMSON STREAM
SO THE ROMAN CONQUERORS OF JERUSALEM AGREED AND FROM THAT DAY ONWARD THE JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD NO COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN THEY HAVE INDEED BEEN LED AWAY CAPTIVE INTO ALL NATIONS
THEY ALLOWED THE JEWISH TEACHERS TO CONTINUE THE SYNAGOGUE SERVICES IN OTHER PARTS OF PALESTINE AND TO TEACH IN THEIR COLLEGES THE MOST FAMOUS JEWISH COLLEGE OF THESE DAYS WAS AT TIBERIUS ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA OF GALILEE
HOW TEDIOUS AND MEANINGLESS SUCH INFORMATION APPEARS OF WHAT VALUE WERE ALL THESE DETAILS TO SPEND ALL HIS DAYS IN LEARNING SUCH THINGS AS THESE COULD HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON A MAN'S CHARACTER NOR MAKE HIM A POWER FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD
ASSERTED THE OTHER HE'S ASSISTED THREE OR FOUR SCORE YOUNG MEN TO START IN BUSINESS IN THE LAST YEAR TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE BY LENDING THEM SUMS RANGING FROM ONE TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS
WITHOUT CAPITAL YOU KNOW MANY A YOUNG FELLOW WOULD NEVER GET HIS FOOT ON THE FIRST ROUND OF THE LADDER AND MANY WILL NEVER GET IT THERE IN ANY EVENT DECLARED THE MAJOR WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
AND HOW CAN I TELL WHETHER THEY'RE DESARVING OR NOT RETORTED MAJOR DOYLE FIERCELY DO YE WANT ME TO BECOME A SLEUTH OR ENGAGE DETECTIVES TO TRACK THE OBJECTS OF YOUR ERRONEOUS PHILANTHROPY
IF YOU WOULD LET HIM HAVE THREE THOUSAND MORE SO YOU TOOK THE FARM AND GAVE HIM THE MONEY I DID SIR PERHAPS I AM TO BLAME
MAKING FIVE THOUSAND IN ALL WELL IT'S GONE JOHN AND YOU'VE GOT THE FARM THE OTHER FELLOWS WERE TOO CLEVER FOR MY YOUNG FRIEND JOSEPH WEGG AND KNOCKED OUT HIS PATENT I'M SO SORRY SAID PATSY SYMPATHETICALLY
HAVE YOU INVESTIGATED THE FARM AT ALL I LOOKED UP A REAL ESTATE DEALER LIVING AT MILLVILLE AND WROTE HIM ABOUT THE WEGG FARM HE SAID IF ANY ONE WANTED THE PLACE VERY BADLY IT MIGHT SELL FOR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS HUMPH
FOR A TIME HE ATE WITH GREAT DELIBERATION AND REVOLVED AN INTERESTING THOUGHT IN HIS MIND YEARS AGO
BETH IS STILL WITH LOUISE YOU KNOW AND THEY MUST FIND THE CITY DEADLY DULL JUST NOW THE FARM'S THE THING AND THE MAJOR CAN RUN UP TO SEE US FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS IN THE HOT WEATHER AND WE'LL ALL HAVE A GLORIOUS LAZY TIME
AND THE INCONSEQUENT HOME ENVIRONMENTS THE GIRL WAS MORE UNAFFECTED AND NATURAL IN HER WAYS AND HER FAULTS WERE DOUBTLESS MORE THE RESULT OF EDUCATION THAN OF NATURAL TENDENCY ONE THING WAS INDISPUTABLE HOWEVER
WERE NEARLY FORGOTTEN IN THE COMMUNITY AND SOON WOULD BE FORGOTTEN ALTOGETHER UNLESS THE QUICK EAR OF A YOUNG GIRL HAD CAUGHT THE CLUE SO LONG IGNORED AT FIRST SHE SCARCELY APPRECIATED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING
LOUISE SET TO WORK TO TABULATE THE INFORMATION SHE HAD RECEIVED THUS FAR NOTING THE ELEMENT OF MYSTERY EACH FACT EVOLVED FIRST CAPTAIN WEGG MUST HAVE BEEN A RICH MAN IN ORDER TO BUILD THIS HOUSE
AND WARRANT AN EFFORT TO UNTANGLE THE MYSTERY AND AS INSTRUMENTS TO THE END THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE AVAILABLE WHO COULD BE OF USE TO HER MC NUTT THE AGENT WHO EVIDENTLY KNEW MORE THAN HE HAD CARED TO TELL OLD HUCKS AND HIS WIFE
AND ETHEL THOMPSON THE SCHOOL TEACHER THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS BUT ONE OR ANOTHER OF THESE FOUR MUST KNOW THE TRUTH AND IT WOULD BE HER PLEASANT DUTY TO OBTAIN A FULL DISCLOSURE SO SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO BEGIN HER INVESTIGATIONS AT ONCE
WHEN HER UNCLE RETURNED FROM HIS VISIT TO THE PIGS LOUISE SAID TO HIM I'VE BEEN THINKING DEAR THAT WE OUGHT TO CALL UPON THAT YOUNG LADY WHO ARRANGED OUR ROOMS AND THANK HER FOR HER KINDNESS THAT'S TRUE HE REPLIED
WHEN PATSY AND BETH WILL BE ABLE TO MEET HER THAT'S A GOOD IDEA LOUISE I WAS WONDERING WHAT I'D DO THIS MORNING TELL OLD HUCKS TO GET THE NAG HARNESSED THE GIRL RAN EAGERLY UPON HER ERRAND
BUT HE TURNED WITHOUT A WORD TO HARNESS THE HORSE LOUISE STOOD WATCHING HIM YOUR FINGERS ARE QUITE NIMBLE THOMAS CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT YOU WERE ONCE A SAILOR SHE SAID BUT SAILORS HAVE TO BE NIMBLE MISS HE RETURNED
DON'T JERK THE BIT FER HIS MOUTH'S TENDER AN IT MAKES HIM BALKY EF HE BALKS JEST LET HIM REST A TIME AN THEN SPEAK TO HIM DAN AIN'T VICIOUS HE'S JEST ORNERY SHE CLIMBED INTO THE DILAPIDATED OLD BUGGY AND TOOK THE REINS
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE THOMPSONS LIVE INQUIRED UNCLE JOHN NO WHOA DAN THAT WAS THE BEST THING THE NAG DID HE KNEW HOW TO WHOA THOMAS CALLED UNCLE JOHN TURNING IN HIS SEAT
IT HAD NOT BEEN THE GRAND FESTIVAL DREAMED BY THE GRANDFATHER A FAIRY SPECTACLE WITH A CONFUSION OF CHERUBIM AND CUPIDS OVER THE HEADS OF THE BRIDAL PAIR A MARRIAGE WORTHY TO FORM THE SUBJECT OF A PAINTING TO BE PLACED OVER A DOOR BUT IT HAD BEEN SWEET AND SMILING
OATHS TO THE NORMAN HORSES WITH THEIR TAILS KNOTTED UP FALSE GALLOONS VARNISHED HAT LONG POWDERED LOCKS AN ENORMOUS WHIP AND TALL BOOTS FRANCE DOES NOT YET CARRY ELEGANCE TO THE LENGTH OF DOING LIKE THE ENGLISH NOBILITY
WHICH BROUGHT HIM GOOD LUCK OLD SHOES AND SLIPPERS DO NOT AS YET FORM A PART OF OUR NUPTIAL CELEBRATIONS BUT PATIENCE AS GOOD TASTE CONTINUES TO SPREAD WE SHALL COME TO THAT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
MARRIAGE WAS NOT CONDUCTED AT A FULL TROT STRANGE TO SAY AT THAT EPOCH PEOPLE STILL IMAGINED THAT A WEDDING WAS A PRIVATE AND SOCIAL FESTIVAL THAT A PATRIARCHAL BANQUET DOES NOT SPOIL A DOMESTIC SOLEMNITY THAT GAYETY EVEN IN EXCESS
NATURAL AND COMMONPLACE AS THIS MATTER OF MARRYING IS THE BANNS TO PUBLISH THE PAPERS TO BE DRAWN UP THE MAYORALTY AND THE CHURCH PRODUCE SOME COMPLICATION THEY COULD NOT GET READY BEFORE THE SIXTEENTH OF FEBRUARY
AS THE MARRIAGE WAS TAKING PLACE UNDER THE REGIME OF COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY THE PAPERS HAD BEEN SIMPLE
THOSE TWO BROOKS OF CARRIAGES FLOWING THE ONE DOWN STREAM THE OTHER UP STREAM
HAD THE SAME PRIVILEGE IN THIS GAYETY OF PARIS ENGLAND CRACKED HER WHIP LORD SEYMOUR'S POST CHAISE HARASSED BY A NICKNAME FROM THE POPULACE PASSED WITH GREAT NOISE IN THE DOUBLE FILE ALONG WHICH THE MUNICIPAL GUARDS GALLOPED LIKE SHEEP DOGS
HONEST FAMILY COACHES LOADED DOWN WITH GREAT AUNTS AND GRANDMOTHERS DISPLAYED AT THEIR DOORS FRESH GROUPS OF CHILDREN IN DISGUISE CLOWNS OF SEVEN YEARS OF AGE COLUMBINES OF SIX RAVISHING LITTLE CREATURES WHO FELT THAT THEY FORMED AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE PUBLIC MIRTH
ONE CARRIAGE DELAYED SUFFICED TO PARALYZE THE WHOLE LINE THEN THEY SET OUT AGAIN ON THE MARCH THE WEDDING CARRIAGES WERE IN THE FILE PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BASTILLE AND SKIRTING THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOULEVARD
NEARLY AT THE SAME MOMENT THE OTHER FILE WHICH WAS PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE MADELEINE HALTED ALSO AT THAT POINT OF THE FILE THERE WAS A CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKERS THESE CARRIAGES OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY THESE WAGON LOADS OF MASKERS
THERE IS GOVERNMENT THEREIN THERE ONE LAYS ONE'S FINGER ON A MYSTERIOUS AFFINITY BETWEEN PUBLIC MEN AND PUBLIC WOMEN IT CERTAINLY IS SAD THAT TURPITUDE HEAPED UP SHOULD GIVE A SUM TOTAL OF GAYETY
THE LAUGHTER OF ALL IS THE ACCOMPLICE OF UNIVERSAL DEGRADATION CERTAIN UNHEALTHY FESTIVALS DISAGGREGATE THE PEOPLE AND CONVERT THEM INTO THE POPULACE AND POPULACES LIKE TYRANTS REQUIRE BUFFOONS THE KING HAS ROQUELAURE
AND THE TWO MASKERS WHO HAD JUST SPOKEN HAD TO FACE THE THRONG WITH THEIR COMRADES AND DID NOT FIND THE ENTIRE REPERTORY OF PROJECTILES OF THE FISHMARKETS TOO EXTENSIVE TO RETORT TO THE ENORMOUS VERBAL ATTACKS OF THE POPULACE A FRIGHTFUL EXCHANGE OF METAPHORS TOOK PLACE
AND WHILE THEIR COMPANIONS AND THE PASSERS BY WERE EXCHANGING INSULTS THEY HAD HELD A DIALOGUE IN A LOW VOICE THEIR ASIDE WAS COVERED BY THE TUMULT AND WAS LOST IN IT THE GUSTS OF RAIN HAD DRENCHED THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE WHICH WAS WIDE OPEN
CAN YOU SEE THE BRIDE IF YOU STOOP DOWN NO AND THE BRIDEGROOM THERE'S NO BRIDEGROOM IN THAT TRAP BAH UNLESS IT'S THE OLD FELLOW TRY TO GET A SIGHT OF THE BRIDE BY STOOPING VERY LOW I CAN'T
GOOD HERE I AM UTTERING DEMAGOGICAL WORDS AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I HAVE NO LONGER ANY POLITICAL OPINIONS LET ALL ME BE RICH THAT IS TO SAY MIRTHFUL AND I CONFINE MYSELF TO THAT WHEN AT THE CONCLUSION OF ALL THE CEREMONIES
IN FRONT OF SAINT PAUL TO GAZE THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE CARRIAGE AT THE ORANGE FLOWERS QUIVERING ON COSETTE'S HEAD THEN THEY RETURNED HOME
THEY PRESSED ABOUT COSETTE EACH ONE VIED WITH THE REST IN SALUTING HER
ON THE WALLS SCONCES WITH TRIPLE AND QUINTUPLE BRANCHES MIRRORS SILVERWARE GLASSWARE PLATE PORCELAIN FAIENCE POTTERY GOLD AND SILVERSMITH'S WORK ALL WAS SPARKLING AND GAY
JEAN VALJEAN HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON A CHAIR IN THE DRAWING ROOM BEHIND THE DOOR THE LEAF OF WHICH FOLDED BACK UPON HIM IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO NEARLY CONCEAL HIM A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE COSETTE CAME
AND ARRANGED THEMSELVES IN THE PROPER ORDER AROUND THE TABLE TWO LARGE ARM CHAIRS FIGURED ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE BRIDE THE FIRST FOR M GILLENORMAND THE OTHER FOR JEAN VALJEAN
M FAUCHELEVENT TOLD ME TO SAY TO YOU SIR THAT HE WAS SUFFERING HIS INJURED HAND WAS PAINING HIM SOMEWHAT AND THAT HE COULD NOT DINE WITH MONSIEUR LE BARON
AND THE GRANDFATHER BEAMED FOR TWO HE AFFIRMED THAT M FAUCHELEVENT HAD DONE WELL TO RETIRE EARLY IF HE WERE SUFFERING BUT THAT IT WAS ONLY A SLIGHT AILMENT THIS DECLARATION SUFFICED MOREOVER
THE ARM CHAIR BEING OCCUPIED M FAUCHELEVENT WAS OBLITERATED AND NOTHING WAS LACKING AND FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARD THE WHOLE TABLE FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER WAS LAUGHING WITH ALL THE ANIMATION OF FORGETFULNESS AT DESSERT
LET US BE HAPPY WITHOUT QUIBBLING AND QUIRKING LET US OBEY THE SUN BLINDLY WHAT IS THE SUN IT IS LOVE HE WHO SAYS LOVE SAYS WOMAN AH AH BEHOLD OMNIPOTENCE WOMEN
I WOULD LIKE GREATLY TO GET MARRIED IF ANY ONE WOULD HAVE ME
THERE WAS A TUMULT THEN SILENCE THE MARRIED PAIR DISAPPEARED A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT
PROOF ALL THE MODES IN WHICH ANY GIVEN BODY IS AFFECTED
IN OTHER WORDS IT WILL HAVE THE IDEA WHICH DOES NOT EXCLUDE BUT POSTULATES THE EXISTENCE OR PRESENCE OF THE NATURE OF THE EXTERNAL BODY
COROLLARY THE MIND IS ABLE TO REGARD AS PRESENT EXTERNAL BODIES BY WHICH THE HUMAN BODY HAS ONCE BEEN AFFECTED EVEN THOUGH THEY BE NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE OR PRESENT
THOSE WHICH INVOLVE THE NATURE BOTH OF THE HUMAN BODY AND OF EXTERNAL BODIES I SAY SECONDLY
BUT ANOTHER POWER THAT LOVE KNOT TIED AND I SAW THE CHAIN ROUND THE NECK OF THE BRIDE A GLISTENING PRICELESS MARVELOUS CHAIN COILED WITH DIAMONDS AGAIN AND AGAIN AS BEFITS A DIAMOND WEDDING YET STILL TWAS A CHAIN AND I THOUGHT SHE KNEW IT
WILL SHIVER UPON THE BANKS OF THE STYX QUITE AS HELPLESS AS THEY WERE BORN NAKED SOULS AND VERY FORLORN THE PRINCESS THEN MUST SHIFT FOR HERSELF AND LAY HER ROYALTY ON THE SHELF SHE AND THE BEAUTIFUL EMPRESS YONDER WHOSE ROBES ARE NOW THE WIDE WORLD'S WONDER
SO DE NEX NIGHT DE GAL WENT OFF AN COMED BACK LATE WID DE YOUNG MAN HER MAMMY AX HIM IN AN GIN HIM A SEAT BY DE FIRE AN DAR HE SOT ALL WROP UP IN HIS BLINKIT WID HIS HAID TURNT WAY F'UM DE LIGHT
AND DIDN'T HE EVER COME BACK SAID NED NAW SUH DAT HE DIDN HE WUZ TOO SHAME TER COME BACK AN HE BIN SO SHAME ER DE TRICK UVER SENCE DAT HE HIDE HISSE'F WAY IN DE DAYTIME AN NUVER COME OUT TWEL DE DUSK
SHE MUST HAVE HAD A TIME OF IT IT WAS MY FATE TO TAKE PASSAGE IN THIS BOAT THE CAPTAIN WAS A GOOD NATURED EASY GOING MAN CAREFUL OF THE COMFORT OF HIS PASSENGERS AND EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF THE GAME OF BRAG WE HAD BEEN OUT A LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE DAYS
THEY WANTED TO LEARN THE GAME AT TWO O'CLOCK THE CAPTAIN ASKED THE MATE HOW WE WERE GETTING ON OH PRETTY GLIBLY SIR REPLIED THE MATE WE CAN SCARCELY TELL WHAT HEADWAY WE ARE MAKING FOR WE ARE OBLIGED TO KEEP THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER AND THERE IS THE SHADOW OF A FOG RISING
IT APPEARS THE TWO PASSENGERS IN THEIR FIRST LESSON HAD INCIDENTALLY LOST ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS THE CAPTAIN AS HE ROSE TO SEE ABOUT TAKING IN SOME GOOD WOOD WHICH HE FELT SURE OF OBTAINING NOW THAT HE HAD GOT ABOVE THE LEVEL COUNTRY WINKED AT HIS OPPONENT
AND THE CAPTAIN HAILED HALLO THE WOODYARD HALLO YOURSELF ANSWERED A SQUEAKING FEMALE VOICE WHICH CAME FROM A WOMAN WITH A PETTICOAT OVER HER SHOULDERS IN PLACE OF A SHAWL WHAT'S THE PRICE OF WOOD
ACCOMPANIED BY THE SAME LEER OF THE SAME YELLOW COUNTENANCE WHY DARN IT ALL CAPTING THERE IS BUT THREE OR FOUR CORDS LEFT AND SINCE IT'S YOU I DON'T CARE IF I DO LET YOU HAVE IT FOR THREE AS YOU'RE A GOOD CUSTOMER
AND TURNED IN TO TAKE SOME REST THE FACT BECAME APPARENT THE READER WILL PROBABLY HAVE DISCOVERED IT SOME TIME SINCE
ON THE DAY AFTER HIS RETURN HE RECEIVED PROPER AUTHENTIC TIDINGS OF HIS PRESENTATION TO THE PREBEND HE WAS IN FACT ALREADY PREBENDARY
AND LUCY'S WARM AND EAGER JOY MADE HIM FEEL QUITE DELIGHTED WITH MISTER SOWERBY AND THE DUKE OF OMNIUM AND THEN THAT SPLENDID ANIMAL DANDY CAME HOME TO THE PARSONAGE STABLES MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE GROOM AND GARDENER
INDEED JUST AT THIS MOMENT
HASTE AND SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND MEN RUNNING TO AND FRO WITH BLANK ACCEPTANCES IN THEIR HANDS COULD ALONE STAVE OFF THE CRACK OF DOOM BUT AT OTHER TIMES WHEN RETALIATORY APPLICATIONS WERE MADE TO HIM
SHE HAD DECLARED TO HIM PLAINLY THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM AND COULD NOT LOVE HIM AND HAD THUS THROWN AWAY NOT ONLY RICHES AND HONOUR AND HIGH STATION BUT MORE THAN THAT MUCH WORSE THAN THAT SHE HAD FLUNG AWAY FROM HER THE LOVER TO WHOSE LOVE HER WARM HEART CLUNG
WE ARE GOING TO DRIVE OVER TO HOGGLESTOCK THIS MORNING FANNY SAID ONE DAY AT BREAKFAST I SUPPOSE MARK YOU WON'T GO WITH US
WILL YOU SAY THAT I'LL BE OVER ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK YOU HAD BETTER SAY EARLIER AS HE IS ALWAYS OUT ABOUT THE PARISH VERY WELL SAY ELEVEN IT IS PARISH BUSINESS ABOUT WHICH I AM GOING SO IT NEED NOT IRK HIS CONSCIENCE TO STAY IN FOR ME
AS TO MAKE HER SISTER IN LAW QUITE SURE THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO LOVE PASSAGES UP TO THAT TIME AND NOTHING HAD SINCE OCCURRED WHICH HAD CREATED ANY SUSPICION IN MISSUS ROBARTS MIND SHE HAD SEEN AT ONCE THAT ALL THE CLOSE INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM WAS OVER AND THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
THEN I REALLY DO THINK THAT HE HAS UNCOMMON BAD TASTE SAID LUCY WITH A REALITY IN HER VOICE DIFFERING MUCH FROM THE TONE OF BANTER SHE HAD HITHERTO USED WHAT LUCY SAID HER SISTER IN LAW LOOKING AT HER
I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IT'S NO USE YOUR LOOKING AT ME FANNY YOU WILL MAKE ME TALK OF IT AND I WON'T TELL A LIE ON THE SUBJECT I DO LIKE LORD LUFTON VERY MUCH AND I DO DISLIKE GRISELDA GRANTLY ALMOST AS MUCH
THEREFORE I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IF THEY BECOME MAN AND WIFE HOWEVER
THERE WAS THEN NOTHING MORE SAID ON THE SUBJECT AND IN TWO MINUTES THEY ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF THE HOGGLESTOCK CLERGYMAN MISSUS CRAWLEY HAD BROUGHT TWO CHILDREN WITH HER WHEN SHE CAME FROM THE CORNISH CURACY TO HOGGLESTOCK AND TWO OTHER BABIES HAD BEEN ADDED TO HER CARES SINCE THEN
WHICH THEY KNEW IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE IN MISTER CRAWLEY'S PRESENCE SHE AS WE HAVE SAID WAS NOT QUITE SO GAUNT NOT ALTOGETHER SO HAGGARD AS IN THE LATTER OF THOSE DREADFUL CORNISH DAYS LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ARABIN BETWEEN THEM
AND THE SCANTY COMFORT OF THEIR IMPROVED THOUGH STILL WRETCHED INCOME HAD DONE SOMETHING TOWARDS BRINGING HER BACK TO THE WORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD LIVED IN THE SOFT DAYS OF HER CHILDHOOD BUT EVEN THE LIBERAL STIPEND OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
ALMOST AS PENNILESS AS THE CURATE HIMSELF THEN THEY WOULD WALK TOGETHER FOR HOURS ALONG THE ROCK BOUND SHORE LISTENING TO THE WAVES DISCUSSING DEEP POLEMICAL MYSTERIES SOMETIMES WITH HOT FURY THEN AGAIN WITH TENDER LOVING CHARITY
BUT ALWAYS WITH A MUTUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF EACH OTHER'S TRUTH NOW THEY LIVED COMPARATIVELY NEAR TOGETHER BUT NO OPPORTUNITIES AROSE FOR SUCH DISCUSSIONS AT ANY RATE ONCE A QUARTER MISTER CRAWLEY WAS PRESSED BY HIS OLD FRIEND TO VISIT HIM AT THE DEANERY
FOR SHE HAD WORK OF THIS KIND OF HER OWN AT HOME WHICH SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF NURSES WAS MORE PLENTIFUL WITH HER THAN AT HOGGLESTOCK MISSUS CRAWLEY DID GET UP AND TOLD LUCY THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND MISTER CRAWLEY CAME FORWARD GRAMMAR IN HAND LOOKING HUMBLE AND MEEK
AND SHE KNOWS AN ODE OF HORACE ALL BY HEART SAID BOB AN ODE OF HORACE SAID LUCY STILL HOLDING THE YOUNG SHAMEFACED FEMALE PRODIGY CLOSE TO HER KNEES IT IS ALL THAT I CAN GIVE THEM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY APOLOGETICALLY
SO THAT LUCY ANXIOUSLY WISHED THAT MISTER CRAWLEY COULD BE GOT RID OF AND THE PRESENTS PRODUCED I HOPE YOU HAVE LEFT MISTER ROBARTS QUITE WELL SAID MISTER CRAWLEY WITH A STIFF CEREMONIAL VOICE
YES I HAVE HEARD OF IT SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GRAVELY I HOPE THAT HIS PROMOTION MAY TEND IN EVERY WAY TO HIS ADVANTAGE HERE AND HEREAFTER IT SEEMED HOWEVER TO BE MANIFEST FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIS KIND WISHES
HIS NEW DUTIES DO NOT DISTURB HIM MUCH AS YET SAID LUCY AND HIS RIDING OVER HERE WILL BE NO TROUBLE TO HIM YES THERE HE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER ME I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NO HORSE
WHAT IS THAT BOB SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GINGERBREAD FALTERED BOBBY FEELING THAT A SIN HAD BEEN COMMITTED THOUGH PROBABLY FEELING ALSO THAT HE HIMSELF COULD HARDLY AS YET BE ACCOUNTED AS DEEPLY GUILTY MISS ROBARTS SAID THE FATHER WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
AND THEN THE BAG IN A SOLEMN MANNER WAS CARRIED OVER TO THEIR MOTHER WHO TAKING IT FROM HER SON'S HANDS LAID IT HIGH ON A BOOKSHELF AND NOT ONE NOW SAID LUCY ROBARTS VERY PITEOUSLY DON'T BE SO HARD MISTER CRAWLEY NOT UPON THEM BUT UPON ME
HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE SOUND OF SUGAR PLUMS IN SPITE OF THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY WITHDREW HER HAND FROM HER MUFF AND LOOKED GUILTY WAS SHE NOT DECEIVING THE GOOD MAN NAY TEACHING HIS OWN CHILDREN TO DECEIVE HIM
SUCH THINGS ARE SO MUCH WORSE FOR A MAN THAN FOR A WOMAN FANNY WAS NOT QUITE PREPARED TO ADMIT THIS IN HER OWN HEART BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY ON THAT HEAD I AM SURE I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO BE OF USE TO YOU SHE SAID IF YOU WILL ONLY LOOK UPON ME AS AN OLD FRIEND AND WRITE TO ME IF YOU WANT ME
MISSUS ARABIN TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS YOU SHOULD GO TO THEM SAID MISSUS ROBARTS AH YES BUT THAT I FEAR IS IMPOSSIBLE THE CHILDREN YOU KNOW MISSUS ROBARTS
CHAPTER TWELVE DISORDER A PARTISAN OF ORDER
HE DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION HE IS A MAN WHO DOES GOOD BY GUN SHOTS SAID COMBEFERRE THOSE WHO HAVE PRESERVED SOME MEMORY OF THIS ALREADY DISTANT EPOCH KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM THE SUBURBS WAS VALIANT AGAINST INSURRECTIONS
WHOSE ESTABLISHMENT HAD BEEN CLOSED BY THE RIOTS BECAME LEONINE AT THE SIGHT OF HIS DESERTED DANCE HALL AND GOT HIMSELF KILLED TO PRESERVE THE ORDER REPRESENTED BY A TEA GARDEN IN THAT BOURGEOIS AND HEROIC TIME
IN THE PRESENCE OF IDEAS WHICH HAD THEIR KNIGHTS INTERESTS HAD THEIR PALADINS THE PROSINESS OF THE ORIGINATORS DETRACTED NOTHING FROM THE BRAVERY OF THE MOVEMENT THE DIMINUTION OF A PILE OF CROWNS MADE BANKERS SING THE MARSEILLAISE
THE DRUM SUDDENLY BEAT CAPRICIOUS CALLS AT THE COMMAND OF SUCH OR SUCH A COLONEL OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
SOME OF THE SWORD LIKE FANNICOT OTHERS OF THE PEN LIKE HENRI FONFREDE CIVILIZATION UNFORTUNATELY REPRESENTED AT THIS EPOCH RATHER BY AN AGGREGATION OF INTERESTS THAN BY A GROUP OF PRINCIPLES WAS OR THOUGHT ITSELF IN PERIL
WITH WHICH NO ONE PARTY HAD ANY RIGHT TO REPROACH THE REST FOR IT HAS BEEN APPLIED BY THE REPUBLIC IN AMERICA AS WELL AS BY THE MONARCHY IN EUROPE THIS LYNCH LAW WAS COMPLICATED WITH MISTAKES ON ONE DAY OF RIOTING A YOUNG POET NAMED PAUL AIME GARNIER
THEY SHOUTED THERE'S ANOTHER OF THOSE SAINT SIMONIANS AND THEY WANTED TO KILL HIM NOW HE HAD UNDER HIS ARM A VOLUME OF THE MEMOIRS OF THE DUC DE SAINT SIMON
AND HAD SHOUTED DEATH ON THE SIXTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO A COMPANY OF THE NATIONAL GUARDS FROM THE SUBURBS COMMANDED BY THE CAPTAIN FANNICOT ABOVE MENTIONED
THIS MOMENTARY HESITATION GAVE THE INSURGENTS TIME TO RE LOAD THEIR WEAPONS AND A SECOND AND VERY DESTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE STRUCK THE COMPANY BEFORE IT COULD REGAIN THE CORNER OF THE STREET ITS SHELTER A MOMENT MORE AND IT WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO FIRES
AND IT RECEIVED THE VOLLEY FROM THE BATTERY PIECE WHICH NOT HAVING RECEIVED THE ORDER HAD NOT DISCONTINUED ITS FIRING THE INTREPID AND IMPRUDENT FANNICOT WAS ONE OF THE DEAD FROM THIS GRAPE SHOT HE WAS KILLED BY THE CANNON THAT IS TO SAY BY ORDER
IN PLAIN SIGHT ON THE OPEN BOULEVARD HE PLACED ONE KNEE ON THE GROUND SHOULDERED HIS WEAPON FIRED KILLED THE COMMANDER OF THE SQUADRON AND TURNED AWAY SAYING THERE'S ANOTHER WHO WILL DO US NO MORE HARM HE WAS PUT TO THE SWORD
THESE GENERAL SYMPTOMS WHICH PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE UPRISING HAD BEEN RENDERED LOCAL THIS FEVER OF WRATH THESE SPARKS WHICH FLEW HITHER AND THITHER ABOVE THOSE DEEP MASSES OF
HAD ANY ONE BEEN NEAR HIM THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE HEARD HIM MUTTER IN A LOW VOICE PATRIA
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT FANNICOT'S COMPANY HAD LEFT BEHIND IT A TRAIL OF BODIES TWENTY CORPSES LAY SCATTERED HERE AND THERE ON THE PAVEMENT THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE STREET TWENTY CARTOUCHES FOR GAVROCHE MEANT A PROVISION OF CARTRIDGES FOR THE BARRICADE
FOR THIRST SAID HE PUTTING IT IN HIS POCKET BY DINT OF ADVANCING HE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE FOG OF THE FUSILLADE BECAME TRANSPARENT SO THAT THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE LINE RANGED ON THE OUTLOOK BEHIND THEIR PAVING STONE DIKE
CHAPTER SEVEN PARRY
PAY YOURSELF ADDED THE UNKNOWN I WILL DO SO MONSIEUR SINCE YOU SO POSITIVELY REQUIRE IT A SAD SMILE PASSED OVER THE LIPS OF THE GENTLEMAN PLACE THE MONEY ON THAT TRUNK SAID HE TURNING ROUND AND POINTING TO THE PIECE OF FURNITURE
DRAWN LIKE A CARRIAGE BY FOUR BLACK HORSES
AND TWENTY OTHER COURTIERS FOLLOWED BY THEIR PEOPLE AND THEIR BAGGAGE CLOSED THIS VERITABLY TRIUMPHANT MARCH THE POMP WAS OF A MILITARY CHARACTER
NEVER PARRY CRIED THE GENTLEMAN I BEG YOU WILL YOU COME FROM ENGLAND YOU COME SO FAR AH IT IS NOT FOR YOUR AGE TO UNDERGO THE FATIGUES MY SERVICE REQUIRES REST YOURSELF I HAVE MY REPLY TO GIVE YOUR LORDSHIP IN THE FIRST PLACE
YES MY LORD BUT I WROTE HIM A LETTER WELL HE READ IT AND RECEIVED ME MY LORD DID THAT LETTER THOROUGHLY EXPLAIN MY POSITION AND MY VIEWS OH YES SAID PARRY WITH A SAD SMILE IT PAINTED YOUR VERY THOUGHTS FAITHFULLY WELL THEN PARRY
WHAT ARREST YOU MY MOST FAITHFUL SERVANT YES MY LORD AND NOTWITHSTANDING YOU HAD SIGNED THE NAME PARRY TO ALL MY LETTERS MY LORD
ALL THESE TRUMPETS ARE HIS ALL THOSE GILDED HOUSINGS ARE HIS ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN WEAR SWORDS THAT ARE HIS HIS MOTHER PRECEDES HIM IN A CARRIAGE MAGNIFICENTLY ENCRUSTED WITH SILVER AND GOLD HAPPY MOTHER
WELL WELL MY LORD SAID PARRY MORE UNEASY AT THE TURN THE CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN THAN AT THE OTHER YOU KNOW RESUMED THE UNKNOWN THAT MY MOTHER AND MY SISTER WHILST ALL THIS IS GOING ON IN HONOR OF THE KING OF FRANCE HAVE NEITHER MONEY NOR BREAD YOU KNOW THAT I MYSELF SHALL BE POOR AND DEGRADED WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
PARRY ARE THERE NOT EXAMPLES IN WHICH A MAN OF MY CONDITION SHOULD HIMSELF MY LORD IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN
AND WITH THESE WORDS WHICH HE FINISHED SHARPLY WITH A NERVOUS AND TERRIBLE LAUGH THE YOUNG MAN GIRDED ON HIS SWORD TOOK HIS HAT FROM THE TRUNK
MY GOOD PARRY SAID HE ORDER A FIRE DRINK EAT SLEEP AND BE HAPPY LET US BOTH BE HAPPY MY FAITHFUL FRIEND MY ONLY FRIEND WE ARE RICH AS RICH AS KINGS
AND AS THE MORNING ADVANCED THEY BECAME FULLY AWARE THAT SOMETHING UNUSUAL WAS IN THE WIND SEVERAL TIMES THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FOLDED PAPER BEING STEALTHILY PASSED FROM ONE DESK TO ANOTHER BUT AS TO ITS CONTENTS THEY HAD NO IDEA AS IT WAS NOT HANDED TO ANY ONE OF THEM
ELEANOR STARTED THAT PAPER WHATEVER IT IS SAID NORA O'MALLEY TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU WHO STOOD IN A GROUP AROUND HER DESK SHE WAS HERE WHEN I CAME IN THIS MORNING AND I WAS EARLY TOO IT
THE STANDARD OF THE SCHOOL WILL BE LOWERED THEREFORE I INTEND TO SIFT THIS MATTER TO THE BOTTOM AND FIND OUT WHAT MISCHIEVOUS INFLUENCE PROMPTED THIS ACT OF INSUBORDINATION REPORT SAYS THAT THIS MOVEMENT ORIGINATED IN THE JUNIOR CLASS
WHAT I INSIST UPON KNOWING NOW IS WHO ARE THE REAL CULPRITS BEGINNING WITH THE GIRL WHO ORIGINATED THE PAPER TO THE LAST ONE WHO SIGNED IT
I WROTE IT MISS THOMPSON SHE SAID CLEARLY I WROTE IT BECAUSE I WISHED TO
THE LATTER FLUSHED THEN TURNED PERFECTLY WHITE WITH RAGE STILL STANDING SHE REACHED DOWN
IT WILL HAVE TO BE SOMETHING REMARKABLE IN THIS INSTANCE REPLIED GRACE GRIMLY AS SHE BADE THE GIRLS GOOD BYE REMEMBER GIRLS BASKETBALL PRACTICE AGAIN TO MORROW AND THE REST OF THE WEEK MISS THOMPSON HAS PROMISED ME THE GYMNASIUM PLEASE MAKE IT A POINT TO BE ON HAND
GOOD BYE GRACE CHORUSED HER FRIENDS AND WENT ON DOWN THE STREET DISCUSSING THE PROBABLE FATE OF THE WOULD BE TRUANTS TO RETURN TO THOSE YOUTHFUL TRANSGRESSORS THEY WERE SPENDING A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE HALF HOUR WITH MISS THOMPSON SHE WAS MERCILESS IN HER DENUNCIATION OF THEIR CONDUCT
WHEN THE LAST GIRL HAD DISAPPEARED THE PRINCIPAL TURNED TO ELEANOR
THEY MUST TURN IN TWO THEMES EVERY WEEK OF NOT LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED WORDS ON CERTAIN SUBJECTS TO BE ASSIGNED TO THEM IF DURING THIS TIME ANY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE REPORTED FOR A MISDEMEANOR THEY WERE TO BE SUSPENDED WITHOUT DELAY
THEIR PENALTY WAS FAR FROM LIGHT BUT THEY HAD NOT BEEN SUSPENDED AND SO THEY RESOLVED TO ENDURE IT AS BEST THEY MIGHT GRACE HARLOWE FELT A LOAD LIFTED FROM HER MIND WHEN MISS THOMPSON PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THAT SHE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION FROM EITHER MABEL ALLISON OR THE PHI SIGMA TAU
THANK GOODNESS NONE OF US WERE CONCERNED IN THAT AFFAIR SHE TOLD THE MEMBERS OF HER BASKETBALL TEAM AT RECESS THERE ARE TWO GIRLS ON THE SOPHOMORE AND THREE ON THE FRESHMAN TEAM WHOSE BASKETBALL ARDOR WILL HAVE TO COOL UNTIL AFTER THE MID YEAR EXAMS
TWAS MANY AND MANY A YEAR AGO IN AN AGE BEYOND RECALL THAT NORA THE FRESHMAN LOWLY SAT
WHAT A DELICATE WAY OF REMINDING ME THAT I ONCE WAS A FRESHMAN SHE EXCLAIMED ANNE HAS A NEW ACCOMPLISHMENT SAID GRACE SHE CAN SPOUT POETRY WITHOUT TRYING SMALL CREDIT IS DUE ME SAID ANNE SMILING ANYONE CAN TWIST ANNABEL LEE TO SUIT THE OCCASION
A TALL JUNIOR WHO STOOD UP AND BEAT TIME WITH BOTH HANDS ANNE HAD COMPOSED THE SONG THE WEEK BEFORE THE JUNIORS HAD ALL RECEIVED COPIES OF THE WORDS AND HAD LEARNED THEM BY HEART THEY NOW SANG WITH THE UTMOST GLEE AND CAME OUT PARTICULARLY STRONG ON THE CHORUS WHICH RAN
THEN THE SENIORS SCORED TWICE ON FOULS TYING THE SCORE THE JUNIORS SET THEIR TEETH AND WADED IN WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT AND MAIN SETTING A WHIRLWIND PACE THAT CAUSED THEIR FANS TO SHOUT WITH WILD ENTHUSIASM AND FAIRLY DAZED THEIR OPPONENTS GRACE ALONE NETTED FOUR FOUL GOALS
GLAD TO KNOW THAT SAID GRACE THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF NOISES I COULDN'T DISTINGUISH IT THERE WAS ONE NOISE THAT STARTED THAT WAS PROMPTLY HUSHED SAID ANNE YOU HEARD IT TOO DIDN'T YOU JESSICA OH YES GIRLS I INTENDED TELLING YOU BEFORE THIS REPLIED JESSICA
HARD TO TELL SAID NORA THEY HISSED MISS THOMPSON VERY SOFTLY YOU MAY BE SURE CONTINUED JESSICA BUT IT WAS HISSING JUST THE SAME
SHE IS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE MOST CHARMING GIRL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE LATER ON SHE'LL HAVE VIRTUES WITH AN ODOR OF VIOLETS HOW GRACEFUL ONE CANNOT LIVE OTHERWISE THAN NOBLY WITH SUCH A CREATURE
OF WHICH OF THE TWO FAUCHELEVENTS COSETTE WAS THE DAUGHTER THEY SAID WHAT WAS WANTED AND THEY SAID IT WITH ZEAL AN ACTE DE NOTORIETE WAS DRAWN UP COSETTE BECAME IN THE EYES OF THE LAW MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FAUCHELEVENT
AS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FRANCS THEY CONSTITUTED A LEGACY BEQUEATHED TO COSETTE BY A DEAD PERSON WHO DESIRED TO REMAIN UNKNOWN THE ORIGINAL LEGACY HAD CONSISTED OF FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS
DAUPHINES WITHOUT A RIGHT OR WRONG SIDE IN THE PIECE
HER WEDDING BASKET SEEMED TO HER TO BE UPHELD BY SERAPHIM
WITH WINGS OF MECHLIN LACE THE INTOXICATION OF THE LOVERS WAS ONLY EQUALLED AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID BY THE ECSTASY OF THE GRANDFATHER
PEOPLE THOUGHT MUCH OF LOOKING WELL THEY EMBROIDERED AND TINTED THEMSELVES A BOURGEOIS HAD THE AIR OF A FLOWER A MARQUIS HAD THE AIR OF A PRECIOUS STONE PEOPLE HAD NO STRAPS TO THEIR BOOTS THEY HAD NO BOOTS
IT IS SURPRISING HOW OFTEN UNSUSPECTED VISTAS OF THOUGHTS AND IMPULSES AND EMOTIONS ARE OPENED BY AN INQUIRING ANALYSIS WHERE THE DIRECT REPORT OF THE PATIENT DOES NOT AWAKEN THE LEAST SUSPICION
THE INTELLECTUAL CLEARNESS OF THE PATIENT TOO EASILY TEMPTS ONE INTO TRUSTING THE SINCERITY OF HIS STORY AND YET THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS CLUSTERING PERHAPS ABOUT LOVE OR AMBITION ABOUT VICE OR CRIME ABOUT BUSINESS FAILURE OR FAMILY SECRETS
IT IS THEREFORE CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICIAN SIMPLY DECIDE BEFOREHAND ON A DEFINITE COURSE OF PSYCHICAL TREATMENT AND LEAVE THE CARRYING OUT TO A WELL MEANING MINISTER OR ANY OTHER MEDICAL AMATEUR WHO SCHEMATICALLY FOLLOWS THE INDICATED PATH
THE FINEST ADJUSTMENT HAS TO COME IN DURING THE TREATMENT ITSELF AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT OFTEN HAS TO SUGGEST ENTIRELY NEW LINES OF PROCEDURE
IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE ONE GREAT OBSTACLE IN THE WORK OF THE ROUTINE PHYSICIAN IS THE LACK OF TIME AND PATIENCE WHICH IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS IS ALWAYS QUICKER THAN TO INFLUENCE THE MIND
NAMELY TO REMOVE THE EXTERNAL SOURCES OF THE DISTURBANCE EXTERNAL INDICATES THERE NOT ONLY THE OUTER WORLD BUT ALSO THE OWN BODY OUTSIDE THE CONSCIOUS PARTS OF THE BRAIN
GROWTHS IN THE NOSE MAY BE OPERATED UPON THE ASTIGMATIC OR THE SHORT SIGHTED EYE MAY BE CORRECTED BY GLASSES THE CHILD WHO IS HARD OF HEARING MAY AT LEAST BE SEATED NEAR THE TEACHER AND THE BACKWARD CHILDREN QUICKLY REACH THE AVERAGE LEVEL
HOWEVER OFTEN HE MAY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT SUCH A LIBERATION WOULD STOP THE SOURCE OF THE MENTAL TROUBLE
AS FAR AS REST INVOLVES SLEEP IT IS CERTAINLY THE IDEAL PRESCRIPTION THERE IS NO OTHER INFLUENCE WHICH BUILDS UP THE INJURED CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AS SAFELY AS SOUND NATURAL SLEEP
IT IS SIMPLY MEANT THAT HE GIVE UP HIS FATIGUING DAILY WORK EVEN IF THAT WORK IS MADE UP OF A ROUND OF ENTERTAINMENTS AND CALLS AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS THE NEURASTHENIC AND ALL SIMILAR VARIETIES ARE SENT AWAY FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY AWAY FROM THE RUSH OF THEIR BUSY LIFE
EVEN TODAY MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT A NEURASTHENIC OR A PSYCHASTHENIC OR A HYSTERIC DISTURBANCE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAY BE IN ITS BEGINNING
THERE IS NO NATION ON EARTH WHICH IS MORE PROUD OF ITS RUSH AND ITS HURRY THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND YET WHAT AN
IF I HAVE A TEN POUND WEIGHT IN ONE HAND I MAY FIND THAT I MUST HAVE ONE POUND MORE IN THE OTHER HAND TO DISCRIMINATE THE DIFFERENCE
YET THAT QUIET COUNTRYMAN MAY REACT IN HIS NARROW SYSTEM NOT LESS WHEN THE MODEST CHANGES IN HIS SURROUNDINGS PROVOKE HIM THE GOSSIP OF HIS NEIGHBOR MAY UNDERMINE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM JUST AS MUCH AS A POLITICAL FIGHT OR THE STRUGGLES OF THE EXCHANGE THAT OF THE CITY MAN
THAT THEY ARE INTERRUPTIONS OF THAT WHICH MUST LAST AND THAT THEY ARE NOT THEMSELVES TO BECOME LASTING STATES
NOR THE LIONS TO THE NEW ART AND IN THEIR PLACE STRETCHED A WIDE PAVEMENT BROKEN BY SLOPES OF STEPS THAT LED UP TO THE NATIONAL GALLERY OVERHEAD THE ROOFS SHOWED CROWDED FRIEZES OF HEADS AGAINST THE BLUE SUMMER SKY
HAD BEEN COMPOSED WITH BOTH SKILL AND ARDOUR THEY HAD A RELIGIOUS RING THE UNINTELLIGENT CHRISTIAN COULD SING THEM WITHOUT A QUALM YET THEIR SENSE WAS PLAIN ENOUGH THE OLD HUMAN CREED THAT MAN WAS ALL EVEN CHRIST'S WORDS THEMSELVES WERE QUOTED
AND HIS THIN METALLIC VOICE PIPED A SENTENCE OR TWO ACROSS THE TINKLING SPLASH OF THE FOUNTAINS BEHIND HIM THEN HE STEPPED BACK AND OLIVER CAME FORWARD IT WAS TOO FAR FOR THE TWO TO HEAR WHAT WAS SAID BUT MABEL SLIPPED A PAPER SMILING TREMULOUSLY
OF THIS GREAT ANNIVERSARY THEN THERE CAME A RETROSPECT COMPARING THE OLD STATE OF ENGLAND WITH THE PRESENT FIFTY YEARS AGO THE SPEAKER SAID POVERTY WAS STILL A DISGRACE NOW IT WAS SO NO LONGER
HE ENUMERATED THE REFORMS PASSED FIFTY YEARS BEFORE ON THIS VERY DAY BY WHICH THE NATION ONCE AND FOR ALL DECLARED THE GLORY OF POVERTY AND MAN'S SYMPATHY WITH THE UNFORTUNATE SO HE HAD TOLD THEM HE WAS TO SING THE PRAISE OF PATIENT POVERTY
OLD MISSUS BRAND LEANED BACK IN HER SEAT AND LOOKED ABOUT HER THE WINDOW WHERE THEY SAT HAD BEEN RESERVED FOR THEM TWO ARM CHAIRS FILLED THE SPACE BUT IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THERE WERE OTHERS STANDING VERY SILENT NOW CRANING FORWARD WATCHING TOO WITH PARTED LIPS
AND A STORM OF LAUGHTER RIPPLED ROUND THE THRONG OF HEADS SHE HEARD AN INDRAWN HISS BEHIND HER CHAIR AND THE NEXT INSTANT AN EXCLAMATION FROM MABEL WHAT WAS THAT THERE WAS A SHARP CRACK AND THE TINY GESTICULATING FIGURE STAGGERED BACK A STEP
NOTHING MORE HE WAS WELL DRESSED THOUGH OLIVER LEANED BACK A LITTLE WEARILY AND CLOSED HIS EYES HIS ARM STILL THROBBED INTOLERABLY BUT HE WAS VERY HAPPY AT HEART IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD BEEN WOUNDED BY A FANATIC
MY DEAR I FEEL VERY DOWNCAST SOMETIMES AS YOU KNOW WELL I DO NOT THINK I SHALL BE AGAIN I HAVE BEEN AFRAID SOMETIMES THAT WE WERE LOSING ALL OUR SPIRIT AND THAT THE OLD TORIES WERE PARTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY PROPHESIED WHAT COMMUNISM WOULD DO
AND SO DRAMATIC THE POOR DEVIL COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A WORSE MOMENT PEOPLE WON'T FORGET IT MABEL'S EYES SHONE WITH PLEASURE YOU POOR DEAR SHE SAID ARE YOU IN PAIN NOT MUCH BESIDES CHRIST
BUT SHE COULD SEE WHAT SHE LOVED TO SEE THAT RESPONSE TO HER OWN HEART AND SO THEY SAT IN SILENCE WHILE THE SKY DARKENED YET MORE AND THE CLICK OF THE WRITER IN THE NEXT ROOM TOLD THEM THAT THE WORLD WAS ALIVE AND THAT THEY HAD A SHARE IN ITS AFFAIRS
TOBOLSK BENARES YAKUTSK EVERYWHERE AND HE'S BEEN TO AUSTRALIA MABEL SAT UP BRISKLY ISN'T THAT VERY HOPEFUL I SUPPOSE SO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE SUFIS ARE WINNING BUT FOR HOW LONG IS ANOTHER QUESTION
BUT HER IMAGINATION SIMPLY REFUSED TO GRASP IT A DUEL OF EAST AND WEST UNDER THESE NEW CONDITIONS WAS AN UNTHINKABLE THING THERE HAD BEEN NO EUROPEAN WAR WITHIN LIVING MEMORY AND THE EASTERN WARS OF THE LAST CENTURY HAD BEEN UNDER THE OLD CONDITIONS
EUROPEAN STOCKS WERE NOT APPRECIABLY LOWER THAN USUAL MEN STILL BUILT HOUSES MARRIED WIVES BEGAT SONS AND DAUGHTERS DID THEIR BUSINESS AND WENT TO THE THEATRE FOR THE MERE REASON THAT THERE WAS NO GOOD IN ANYTHING ELSE THEY COULD NEITHER SAVE NOR PRECIPITATE THE SITUATION
SHE WAS SINCERELY FOND OF THE OLD LADY AND HAD ALWAYS FOUND HER PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE A QUIET SORT OF DELIGHT THE EFFECT OF HER UPON THE MIND WAS AS THAT OF AN EASY CHAIR UPON THE BODY THE OLD LADY WAS SO TRANQUIL AND HUMAN
SO ABSORBED IN SMALL EXTERNAL MATTERS SO REMINISCENT NOW AND THEN OF THE DAYS OF HER YOUTH SO UTTERLY WITHOUT RESENTMENT OR PEEVISHNESS
HE MADE A LITTLE DEPRECATING MOVEMENT WITH HIS HANDS IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT SHE WILL DIE IT
SHE ASKED NO NO SHE MAY LIVE TEN YEARS I SAID HE ADDED A WORD OR TWO OF ADVICE AS TO THE USE OF THE OXYGEN INJECTOR AND WENT AWAY THE OLD LADY WAS LYING QUIETLY IN BED WHEN THE GIRL WENT UP AND PUT OUT A WRINKLED HAND
HE SEEMED MOVED AT SOMETHING AND MABEL LOOKED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT IT IS NOT EASTERN NEWS SHE ASKED HIS EYEBROWS WRINKLED A LITTLE
NEITHER DID SHE LIKE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE SO SHE WALKED BY HERSELF IN THE GARDEN THINKING AND HOPING AND FEARING TILL THE LONG SHADOW LAY ACROSS THE PATH AND THE TUMBLED PLATFORM OF ROOFS WAS BATHED IN A DUSTY GREEN HAZE FROM THE WEST
BUT MABEL STARING OUT INTO THE DARKENING HEAVENS HAD SEEN THE STARS COME OUT LIKE JEWELS ONE BY ONE
HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE WIRED TO MISTER PHILLIPS AND THE SECRETARY HAVE FORGOTTEN TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE SHE WENT AT LAST HOPELESSLY TO THE TELEPHONE AND LOOKED AT IT THERE IT WAS THAT ROUND SILENT MONTH THAT LITTLE ROW OF LABELLED BUTTONS
THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY HOLD THE RECEIVER TO HER EAR SHE LISTENED WHO IS THERE HER HEART LEAPED AT THE SOUND OF HER HUSBAND'S VOICE TINY AND MINUTE ACROSS THE MILES OF WIRE I MABEL SHE SAID ALONE HERE
WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH THE PRESS COME UP HERE TO ME AT ONCE YOU MUST BE PRESENT CAN YOU HEAR OH YES COME THEN AT ONCE IT WILL BE THE GREATEST THING IN HISTORY TELL NO ONE COME BEFORE THE RUSH BEGINS IN HALF AN HOUR THE WAY WILL BE STOPPED OLIVER
FOOD AND LIQUORS AND PLENTY OF COMPANY THIS WILL DO SAID I WE MUST MAKE SOME MONEY HERE HOW SAID FIDDLER JIM THE SAME AS AT THE FOREST INN REPLIED I AT ANY RATE WE CAN BUT TRY SAID PLUMBER GEORGE
I AM GOOD TO KEEP THE DOOR AND REPAIR THEIR BEER ENGINE IF THROUGH BEING OVERWORKED IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO GET OUT OF ORDER WELL I'LL SEE WHAT'S BEST TO BE DONE SAID I IN THE MEANTIME YOU HAVE A REST TILL I COME BACK
I HAD A NOBBLER AND RETURNED TO MY MATES AND FOUND THEM ASLEEP WAKE UP SAID I THERE'S BUSINESS TO BE DONE WHAT'S UP SAID FIDDLER JIM ANYTHING FRESH ASKED PLUMBER GEORGE YES SAID I TELLING THEM ALL ABOUT MY ARRANGEMENTS
THE PLACE WAS NOT RUSHED THE SECOND NIGHT BUT WE NEVERTHELESS ADDED FOUR POUNDS MORE TO OUR TREASURY AFTER A GOOD NIGHT'S REST WE GOT UP AND PREPARED TO START
WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT THE CREEK AND WERE ASTONISHED TO SEE THE NUMBER OF TENTS THE THOUSANDS AT WORK MEN WOMEN GIRLS AND BOYS OF ALL AGES AND THE DEEP HOLES NEARLY FRIGHTENED ME
JOE JOE WHICH WAS RESPONDED TO ALL ROUND THE DIGGINGS IT WAS A SAYING OR CRY THEY HAD WHEN THE POLICE WENT ROUND TO EXAMINE THEIR LICENCES I AND MY PARTY WALKED ON TAKING OBSERVATIONS WHEN ALL AT ONCE SOME ONE CALLED OUT IS THAT YOU PLUMBER GEORGE
AND I DON'T EXPECT THEM BACK FOR A DAY OR TWO IN THE MEANTIME I WILL TELL YOU A THING OR TWO ABOUT THE GOLDFIELDS COME WITH ME TO MY BUTCHER'S THE BUTCHER'S SHOP WAS A TENT WITH TWO OR THREE SHEEP HANGING UP ALSO SOME SAUSAGES
SOME NEIGHBOURS CAME IN AND JIM TURNED OUT HIS FIDDLE AND PLAYED A BIT AFTER WHICH WE HAD SOME GROG FIRED OFF OUR PISTOLS RELOADED THEM MADE UP THE FIRE AND THEN TURNED INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH OUR FIREARMS UNDER OUR PILLOWS
IF YOU ARE LUCKY COME AND PAY AND IN THE MEANTIME GIVE ME YOUR NAMES FOR THE ACCOUNT SO THAT IF YOU HAVE TO LEAVE I MAY HAVE A CLAIM ON THE TENT WE CONSULTED TOGETHER AND AGREED TO HIS TERMS WE THEN HAD NOBBLERS ALL ROUND TOOK POSSESSION OF OUR GOODS AND MOVED INTO OUR NEW TENT
ITS ORIGINAL NAME HOWEVER WAS MOUNT ALEXANDER
IN REGARD TO WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK WITH CERTAINTY BUT WE HERE STRIKE ON A FACTOR OF SUCH IMPORTANCE SUCH NEGLECTED IMPORTANCE FOR THE PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SEXUAL RELATIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN THAT IT CANNOT BE WHOLLY IGNORED
ALL THESE FIGURES ARE REPRODUCED BY PLOSS AND BARTELS EVEN IN MODERN EUROPE THE SAME IDEAS PREVAIL IN PORTUGAL ACCORDING TO REYS IT IS BELIEVED THAT DURING MENSTRUATION WOMEN ARE LIABLE TO BE BITTEN BY LIZARDS
AND TO GUARD AGAINST THIS RISK THEY WEAR DRAWERS DURING THE PERIOD IN GERMANY AGAIN IT WAS BELIEVED UP TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AT LEAST
THE SAME EXPLANATION APPLIES TO THE OBSERVANCE OF THE SAME RULES BY DIVINE KINGS AND PRIESTS
AND ARGUING THAT IT PROCEEDS FROM THE CUSTOM OF EXOGAMY OR MARRIAGE OUTSIDE THE CLAN AND THAT THIS RESTS ON CERTAIN IDEAS ABOUT BLOOD WHICH AGAIN ARE TRACEABLE TO TOTEMISM A THEORY WHICH WE NEED NOT HERE DISCUSS
DURKHEIM IS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE GROUP OF CONCEPTIONS THAT NOW CONCERN US HE INSISTS ON THE EXTREME AMBIGUITY FOUND IN PRIMITIVE CULTURE CONCERNING THE NOTION OF THE DIVINE AND THE CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN AVERSION AND VENERATION
AND POINTS OUT THAT IT IS NOT ONLY AT PUBERTY AND EACH RECURRENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL EPOCH THAT WOMEN HAVE AROUSED THESE EMOTIONS BUT ALSO AT CHILDBIRTH A SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS HORROR HE CONTINUES
WHICH CAN REACH SUCH A DEGREE OF INTENSITY WHICH CAN BE CALLED FORTH BY SO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND REAPPEARS REGULARLY EVERY MONTH TO LAST FOR A WEEK AT LEAST CANNOT FAIL TO EXTEND ITS INFLUENCE BEYOND THE PERIODS TO WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY CONFINED
DURKHEIM PROCEEDS TO ARGUE THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE OCCULT POWERS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FEMININE ORGANISM IS TO BE FOUND IN PRIMITIVE IDEAS CONCERNING BLOOD NOT ONLY MENSTRUAL BLOOD BUT ANY KIND OF BLOOD IS THE OBJECT OF SUCH FEELINGS AMONG SAVAGE AND BARBAROUS PEOPLES
IN ANY CASE INDEED THE SAME IDEAS BEING TRANSFERRED TO WOMEN ALSO COITUS PRODUCES WEAKNESS AND IT PREVENTS THE ACQUISITION OF SUPERNATURAL POWERS THUS AMONG THE WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA BOAS STATES
YET THE TWOFOLD INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN REMAINS CLEAR WHEN WE REVIEW THE WHOLE GROUP OF INFLUENCES WHICH IN THIS STATE SHE IS SUPPOSED TO EXERT SHE BY NO MEANS ACTS ONLY BY PARALYZING SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND DESTROYING THE POWERS OF LIFE
IT MUST BE ADDED TO THIS THAT WE STILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT MERELY THE SURVIVING INFLUENCE OF ANCIENT PRIMITIVE BELIEFS BUT THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF ACTUAL NERVOUS CONDITIONS DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD
PRODUCING WHAT MAY BE DESCRIBED AS AN ABNORMAL NERVOUS TENSION IN THIS WAY WE ARE DOUBTLESS CONCERNED WITH A TISSUE OF PHENOMENA INEXTRICABLY WOVEN OF FOLK LORE AUTOSUGGESTION FALSE OBSERVATION
THUS HE SPEAKS OF TWO YOUNG GIRLS OF ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN SLIGHTLY NEUROPATHIC BUT WITHOUT DEFINITE HYSTERICAL SYMPTOMS WHO DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD FEEL THEMSELVES IN A SORT OF ELECTRICAL STATE
AND ARE CAREFUL NOT TO PLAY ON THEIR INSTRUMENTS AT THIS TIME TWO YOUNG LADIES BOTH GOOD VIOLINISTS ALSO AFFIRMED THAT EVER SINCE THEIR FIRST MENSTRUATION THEY HAD NOTED A TENDENCY FOR THE STRINGS TO SNAP AT THIS PERIOD
ONE A GENUINE ARTIST WHO OFTEN PERFORMED AT CHARITY CONCERTS SYSTEMATICALLY REFUSED TO PLAY AT THESE TIMES AND WAS OFTEN EMBARRASSED TO FIND A PRETEXT THE OTHER WHO ADMITTED THAT SHE WAS NERVOUS AND IRRITABLE AT SUCH TIMES
BUT THAT THERE IS SPONTANEOUS BREAKAGE MOST USUALLY IT HAPPENS THAT A GLASS BREAKS WHEN IT IS BEING DRIED WITH A CLOTH NEEDLES ALSO BREAK WITH UNUSUAL FACILITY AT THIS TIME CLOCKS ARE STOPPED BY MERELY PLACING THE HAND UPON THEM
I DO NOT HERE ATTEMPT TO ESTIMATE CRITICALLY THE VALIDITY OF THESE ALLEGED MANIFESTATIONS SOME OF WHICH MAY CERTAINLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE UNCONSCIOUS MUSCULAR ACTION WHICH FORMS THE BASIS OF THE PHENOMENA OF TABLE TURNING AND THOUGHT READING
SUCH A TASK MAY BEST BE UNDERTAKEN THROUGH THE MINUTE STUDY OF ISOLATED CASES AND IN THIS PLACE I AM MERELY CONCERNED WITH THE GENERAL INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL STATE
ONE HOT SUMMER DAY A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE MARRIAGE JULIET RETURNING TO THE CONSULATE AFTER A MORNING SPENT IN VERY ACTIVE EXERCISE UPON A TENNIS COURT WAS MET ON THE DOORSTEP BY DORA THE YOUNGEST OF THE CLARENCY BUTCHERS
GUESS A PRESENT NO AT LEAST I SUPPOSE NOT BUT THERE MAY BE ONE INSIDE INSIDE OH THEN IT'S A PARCEL ASKED JULIET GOOD HUMOUREDLY SHE FELT A MILD CURIOSITY
THAT IT MUST BE AN ADVERTISEMENT FROM SOME SHOP DEAR MADAM WE SHALL ESTEEM IT A FAVOUR IF YOU CAN MAKE IT CONVENIENT TO CALL UPON US ONE DAY NEXT WEEK UPON A MATTER OF BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY
I WONDER YOU AREN'T ASHAMED OF YOURSELF I'M SURPRISED AT YOU I SHOULDN'T HAVE READ IT IF YOU'D BEEN QUICKER ABOUT TELLING ME WHAT WAS IN IT RETORTED DORA IT'S NOT AT ALL A NICE THING TO PUT TEMPTATION IN THE WAY OF A LITTLE GIRL LIKE ME
DO YOU SUPPOSE I'M MADE OF CAST IRON SHE DEPARTED WITH AN INJURED AIR AND JULIET WENT TO LOOK FOR THE CONSUL WHAT IS IT HE ASKED AS SHE PUT THE ENVELOPE INTO HIS HAND A LETTER YOU WANT ME TO READ NOT A PROPOSAL EH
IN A FEW DAYS YOU WILL HARDLY BE READY TO START TO MORROW WILL YOU I COULD BE READY EASILY SAID JULIET YOU'RE IN A GREAT HURRY TO GET AWAY FROM US SAID SIR ARTHUR WITH A RATHER UNEASY LAUGH NOT FROM YOU
A LETTER WAS WRITTEN AND DISPATCHED TO MESSRS FINDLAY AND INCE SAYING THAT MISS BYRNE WOULD HAVE PLEASURE IN CALLING UPON THEM AT TWELVE O'CLOCK ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY AND JULIET BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARATIONS FOR HER JOURNEY
WITH WHICH THE HEART OF THE EXILE IS SAID TO SWELL AT THE SIGHT OF HIS OWN LAND SHE WONDERED IF THE SIGHT OF THEIR COUNTRY MOVED OTHER PASSENGERS ON THE BOAT AS SHE HERSELF WAS MOVED AND MADE TIMID ADVANCES TO A LADY WHO WAS STANDING NEAR HER
FROM HER SEVERE DEMEANOUR JULIET IMAGINED SHE MIGHT BE A GOVERNESS GOING FOR A HOLIDAY YOU MUST BE GLAD TO BE GOING HOME SHE VENTURED IT'S A FAR CRY NORTH TO MY HOME SAID THE SCOTCHWOMAN THAWING SLIGHTLY
NO DOUBT SHE THOUGHT WHEN THE SHIP STOPPED AND THEY FELT BETTER THEY WOULD BE MORE DISPOSED TO A SENTIMENTALITY LIKE HERS SHE FOUND HER MAID WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SEA SICK OF THOSE ABOARD AND ASSISTED HER ASHORE
SHE WAS YOUNG STRONG AND HEALTHY AND THERE WAS NO REASON THAT TRIFLING DISCOMFORTS OF THIS KIND SHOULD AFFECT HER ENJOYMENT TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE BED INDEED SHE SHUT HER EYES IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE
BUT JULIET ONLY LAUGHED TO HERSELF WITH PLEASURE AT THE BRILLIANCY OF THE DAY SHE FELT THAT THE WEATHER WAS PLAYING UP TO THE OCCASION AS BECAME THIS IMPORTANT MORNING OF HER LIFE FOR THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT SHE DID NOT DOUBT
AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE ASTONISHED HER TO FIND HERSELF CLAIMED AS DAUGHTER BY ANY OF THE REIGNING FAMILIES OF EUROPE SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING OR SO SHE SAID TO HERSELF HOWEVER ASTOUNDING AND THAT BEING SO SHE WAS EXCITED IN PROPORTION
BUT MORE THAN ONE HEAD WAS TURNED TO GAZE AT THE PRETTY GIRL IN THE GARDEN PARTY DRESS WHO STOOD TRANSFIXED BEFORE SHOP AFTER SHOP THIS AMUSEMENT LASTED TILL HALF PAST ELEVEN WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE HOTEL FOR JULIET TO GIVE THE FINAL PATS TO HER HAIR
THROUGH THE GLASS TOP HE HAD JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FIGURE THAT SEEMED FAMILIAR HE HAD SEEN THAT TWEED BEFORE THE SHORT GIRL WITH HER BACK TO HIM WAS WEARING THE DRESS IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER ON THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
THE YOUNG LADY WAS STILL IN SIGHT MAKING HER WAY UP THE STEEP PITCH OF THE MAIN STREET AND THE DETECTIVE FOLLOWED HER DISCREETLY LOITERING BEFORE SHOP WINDOWS AS IF FASCINATED BY THE DISPLAY OF SCOTTISH HOMESPUNS
FOR TEN LONG MINUTES THEY STOOD TALKING DRIVING POOR GIMBLET TO THE DESPERATE EXPEDIENT OF ENTERING THE SHOP AND DEMANDING A CLOSER ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE CAIRNGORM IT IS HUMILIATING TO RELATE THAT HE RECOILED BEFORE IT WHEN IT WAS PLACED IN HIS HAND
IN CONVERSATION UPON THE THEME OF ITS UNIQUE BEAUTIES UNTIL THE SUBJECT WAS EXHAUSTED TO THE POINT OF COLLAPSE EVERY OTHER MINUTE HE MUST STROLL TO THE DOOR AND TAKE A LOOK UP AND DOWN THE ROAD A FRIEND HE EXPLAINED HAD PROMISED TO MEET HIM IN THAT PLACE
HE WAS INDEED NOT A HUNDRED YARDS OFF GIMBLET PLUNGED ONCE MORE INTO THE SHOP AND FASTENED UPON SOME PENCILS WITH A ZEAL NOT VERY CONVINCING AFTER HIS DISAPPOINTING VACILLATION OVER THE BROOCH
HE KEPT HOWEVER A STRICT EYE ON THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL AND AFTER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SAW THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTENTIONS EMERGE WITH FISHING ROD AND BASKET
AND FOR THE REST HIS NOSE WAS SHORT HIS EYES BLUE AND CLOSE TOGETHER AND HIS FOREHEAD HIGH AND NARROW HE LOOKED CLOSELY AT GIMBLET AS HE WENT BY AND FOR A MOMENT THE EYES OF THE TWO MEN MET
HE'S AXTRA FOND O THE FEESHIN WAS THE REPLY FOR A THAT HE'S A FOREIGN SHENTLEMAN WAITING TILL THE BOAT HAD BECOME A DISTANT SPECK ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS GIMBLET MADE HIS WAY INTO THE INN AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE LANDLORD
IN THE MEANTIME THERE WILL BE NO HARM DONE BY A WATCH BEING KEPT ON THE FOREIGN GENTLEMAN WHO IS AT THIS MOMENT TROLLING FOR SALMON ON THE LOCH THE INSPECTOR AGREED AND WHEN THE INVERASHIEL STARTED AN HOUR LATER ON HER VOYAGE DOWN THE LOCH
THE WEATHER WHICH FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS HAD LOOKED LIKE CLEARING HAD NOW TURNED DEFINITELY TO RAIN CLOUDS HAD DESCENDED ON THE HILLS AND THE TREES IN THE VALLEYS STOOPED AND DRIPPED IN THE SATURATED MIST LADEN AIR
AND I AM JUST WONDERING IF SHE HAS CHANGED HER MIND AND ACCEPTED HIM AFTER ALL GIRLS ARE KITTLE CATTLE BUT I'VE GOT QUITE FOND OF THAT ONE AND I HOPE SHE'S NOT FORGOTTEN POOR DAVID SO SOON I REALLY AM FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
ALTHOUGH BECAUSE OF THE WONDERFUL ATHLETIC PROWESS OF ITS STUDENTS THEY HAVE MET AND DEFEATED THE ATHLETES OF MANY A WHITE UNIVERSITY ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD
IT WILL BE SEEN THEN THAT THE COLLEGE EDUCATED MEN AND WOMEN OF MY RACE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED QUITE A FEAT CONSIDERING THEIR ANTECEDENTS AND WHOLLY FOREIGN POINT OF VIEW THEY HAVE HAD TO ADJUST THEMSELVES TO A NEW WAY OF THINKING
I WISH TO CONTRADICT THE POPULAR MISCONCEPTION THAT AN EDUCATED INDIAN WILL NECESSARILY MEET WITH STRONG PREJUDICE AMONG HIS OWN PEOPLE OR WILL BE EDUCATED OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH THEM FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW
FOR A HALF BLOOD NEGRO AND INDIAN MAY PASS FOR AN INDIAN AND SO BE ADMITTED TO FIRST CLASS HOTELS AND EVEN TO HIGH SOCIETY
WE WANT THE BEST IN TWO RACES AND CIVILIZATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT WE HAVE LOST SOME OF US HAVE ENTERED UPON EVERY KNOWN PROFESSIONAL CAREER SUCH AS MEDICINE LAW THE MINISTRY EDUCATION AND THE SCIENCES
AT FIRST TO BE SURE AS INDIAN HERB DOCTORS OR QUACKS OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER BUT LATER AS COMPETENT GRADUATED PHYSICIANS THE GOVERNMENT HAS UTILIZED SEVERAL IN THE INDIAN SERVICE AND OTHERS HAVE ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN PRIVATE PRACTICE
AFTER GRADUATION DOCTOR MONTEZUMA WAS SENT BY THE GOVERNMENT AS PHYSICIAN TO AN INDIAN AGENCY IN MONTANA AND LATER TRANSFERRED TO THE CARLISLE SCHOOL IN A FEW YEARS HE RETURNED TO CHICAGO AND OPENED AN OFFICE
HE HAS BEEN A PROMINENT PHYSICIAN THERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WAS RECENTLY MARRIED TO A LADY OF GERMAN DESCENT HE STANDS UNCOMPROMISINGLY FOR THE TOTAL ABOLITION OF THE RESERVATION SYSTEM AND OF THE INDIAN BUREAU
HOLDING THAT THE RED MAN MUST BE ALLOWED TO WORK OUT HIS OWN SALVATION ONE OF THE EARLIEST PRACTITIONERS OF OUR RACE WAS DOCTOR SUSAN LA FLESCHE PICOTTE OF THE OMAHA TRIBE
THERE IS ANOTHER INDIAN DOCTOR NOT OF FULL BLOOD WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE CITY CLUB OF CHICAGO AND ACTIVE IN CIVIC REFORM IN SEVERAL MIDDLE WESTERN CITIES THERE ARE SUCCESSFUL DOCTORS AND DENTISTS OF MY RACE
BUT HAVE NEVER VERIFIED IT THEIR WONDERFUL AGGRESSIVENESS AND DAUNTLESS PUBLIC SERVICE IN MY MIND POINT TO NATIVE DESCENT AND IF THEY CAN TRUTHFULLY CLAIM IT
HE HAD UNUSUAL ELOQUENCE AND PERSONAL CHARM AND BECAME AT ONCE ONE OF BISHOP HARE'S ABLEST HELPERS IN HIS GREAT WORK AMONG THE SIOUX STATIONED AT PINE RIDGE AT THE TIME OF THE WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE
DOCTOR PUTNAM AND DOCTOR BOAS THE LATTER HAS CALLED HIM ONE OF OUR ABLEST ARCHAEOLOGISTS DOCTOR JONES TRAVELLED AMONG THE VARIOUS TRIBES EVEN TO THE COAST OF LABRADOR AND LABORED ASSIDUOUSLY IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE FOR HARVARD
AND THE MARSHALL FIELD MUSEUM OF CHICAGO AS WELL AS OTHER INSTITUTIONS IT WAS THE CHICAGO MUSEUM WHICH SENT HIM TO THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS WHERE HE WAS MURDERED BY THE NATIVES A FEW YEARS AGO
IN ETHNOLOGICAL WORK AND IS ALSO THE AUTHOR OF A PLEASING STORY OF LIFE IN AN INDIAN SCHOOL CALLED THE MIDDLE FIVE ZITKALASA A SIOUX NOW MISSUS BONNEY
WHICH ATTRACTED FAVORABLE ATTENTION AND WERE FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE VOLUME OF INDIAN LEGENDS AND SEVERAL SHORT STORIES MISSUS BONNEY HAS MORE RECENTLY WRITTEN THE BOOK OF AN INDIAN OPERA CALLED THE SUN DANCE WHICH HAS BEEN PRODUCED IN SALT LAKE CITY
MISTER HILL OF TEXAS IS REPUTED TO BE A MILLIONAIRE HOWARD GANSWORTH A GRADUATE OF CARLISLE AND PRINCETON
WHY HE DID NOT INTRODUCE FOOTBALL IN HIS SCHOOL WHY SAID HE IF I DID THAT HALF THE PRESS OF THE COUNTRY WOULD ATTACK ME FOR DEVELOPING THE ORIGINAL WAR INSTINCTS AND SAVAGERY OF THE INDIAN THE PUBLIC WOULD BE AFRAID TO COME TO OUR GAMES
AT LEAST NOT IN PUBLIC NOT LONG AFTERWARD THE GAME WAS INTRODUCED AT CARLISLE AND I WAS ASKED BY THE GENERAL TO VISIT MONTANA AND THE DAKOTAS TO SECURE PUPILS FOR THE SCHOOL AND INCIDENTALLY RECRUITS FOR HIS FOOTBALL WARRIORS
THE INDIANS VICTORY WAS COMPLETE THESE BOYS ALWAYS FIGHT THE BATTLE ON ITS OWN MERITS THEY PLAY A CLEAN GAME AND LOSE VERY FEW GAMES DURING THE SEASON ALTHOUGH THEY MEET ALL OUR LEADING UNIVERSITIES EACH ON ITS OWN HOME GROUNDS
ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THE IDEA OF A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF PROGRESSIVE INDIANS WAS DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH
NOR ARE THEY ACCUSTOMED TO ALLOWING THE INDIAN A VOICE IN HIS OWN AFFAIRS FURTHERMORE MANY OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE RED MEN ARE ENLISTED IN THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE WHICH WOULD MAKE THEIR POSITION A VERY DIFFICULT ONE IN CASE OF ANY FRICTION WITH THE AUTHORITIES
WE CORRESPONDED WITH LEADING INDIANS AND ARRANGED A MEETING AT COLUMBUS FOR THE FOLLOWING APRIL AT THIS MEETING FIVE WERE PRESENT BESIDES MYSELF DOCTOR MONTEZUMA THOMAS SLOAN CHARLES E DAGENETT HENRY STANDINGBEAR
AND SIMPLY AIM AT AROUSING RACIAL PRIDE AND AMBITION ALONG NEW LINES HOLDING UP A MODERN IDEAL FOR THE SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF OUR YOUTH SHOULD WE PETITION CONGRESS AND IN GENERAL CONTINUE ALONG THE LINES OF THE OLDER INDIAN ASSOCIATIONS
TO DEVELOP ACCORDING TO THE NATURAL LAWS OF SOCIAL EVOLUTION SECOND TO PROVIDE THROUGH OUR OPEN CONFERENCES THE MEANS FOR A FREE DISCUSSION ON ALL SUBJECTS BEARING ON THE WELFARE OF THE RACE THIRD
AFTER A LONG AND TEDIOUS DISCOURSE OF THESE SIX NON NATURAL THINGS AND THEIR SEVERAL RECTIFICATIONS
AND BUT LITTLE AT THIS DAY EXCEPT IT BE FOR A FEW NICE IDLE CITIZENS SURFEITING COURTIERS AND STALL FED GENTLEMEN LUBBERS THE COUNTRY PEOPLE USE KITCHEN PHYSIC
I ACKNOWLEDGE IT A MOST NOBLE AND DIVINE SCIENCE
IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD OF SUCH PURGES AS ARE UNSEASONABLY OR IMMODERATELY TAKEN THEY HAVE THEIR EXCELLENT USE IN THIS AS WELL AS MOST OTHER INFIRMITIES OF ALTERATIVES AND CORDIALS NO MAN DOUBTS BE THEY SIMPLES OR COMPOUNDS
ASCENDING A HEIGHT WE TRACED OUT THE BEST LINE WE COULD DISCOVER FOR THE NEXT DAY'S MARCH AND HAD AT LEAST THE CONSOLATION TO SEE THAT THE MOUNTAIN DESCENDED RAPIDLY THE DAY HAD BEEN ONE OF APRIL GUSTY WITH A FEW OCCASIONAL FLAKES OF SNOW
ON THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE BAY COULD BE TRACED THE GLEAMING LINE WHERE ENTERED ANOTHER LARGE STREAM AND AGAIN THE BUENAVENTURA ROSE UP IN OUR MIND
CARSON SPRANG OVER CLEAR ACROSS A PLACE WHERE THE STREAM WAS COMPRESSED AMONG ROCKS BUT THE PARFLECHE SOLE OF MY MOCCASIN GLANCED FROM THE ICY ROCK AND PRECIPITATED ME INTO THE RIVER
THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND PURE WITH A SHARP WIND FROM THE NORTHEAST AND THE THERMOMETER TWENTY BELOW THE FREEZING POINT WE CONTINUED DOWN THE SOUTH FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN OUR ROAD LEADING OVER DRY GROUND WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID THE SNOW ALMOST ENTIRELY
UNBROKEN BY RAVINES AND COVERED WITH PINES AND SNOW WHILE ON THE SIDE WE WERE TRAVELLING INNUMERABLE RIVULETS POURED DOWN FROM THE RIDGE
A FINE YOUNG HORSE FROM THE COLUMBIA BELONGING TO CHARLES TOWNS AND ANOTHER INDIAN HORSE WHICH CARRIED OUR COOKING UTENSILS THE TWO FORMER GAVE OUT AND THE LATTER STRAYED OFF INTO THE WOODS AS WE REACHED THE CAMP
WHEN IT WAS A COLD MOUNTAIN TORRENT FOAMING AMONG THE ROCKS
AND WE SAT DOWN FOR A WHILE IN THE SHADE OF THE OAKS TO LET THE ANIMALS FEED WE REPEATED OUR SHOUTS FOR MISTER PREUSS AND THIS TIME WE WERE GRATIFIED WITH AN ANSWER THE VOICE GREW RAPIDLY NEARER ASCENDING FROM THE RIVER
HE MEANT TO HAVE IT ONE OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD SO HE CALLED AN OFFICER INTO HIS COUNCIL CHAMBER AND SAID NOW TAKE PLENTY OF TIME TO LOOK ABOUT IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE ALL THE MEN YOU WANT TO HELP YOU
THE MAJOR MADE HASTE TO START FOR RUSSIA BECAUSE THE HONOR WAS GREAT AND THE PAYMENT WOULD BE GENEROUS HE LEFT HIS BOYS AND HIS WIFE BEHIND BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW JUST HOW COMFORTABLE HE COULD MAKE THEM IN THE FAR OFF COUNTRY
MORE THAN ALL HIS PLAYTHINGS HE LIKED A PENCIL AND PAPER FROM THE TIME HE COULD SCRIBBLE AT ALL HE DREW PICTURES OF EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN SIGHT
THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE LITTLE RUSSIAN CHILDREN OR IN LEARNING THE LANGUAGE THEY WENT SKATING DRESSED IN HANDSOME FURS THEY LEARNED THE FOLK AND FANCY DANCES JOINED IN THE WINTER SPORTS AND VOTED RUSSIA A FINE COUNTRY
JAMES WAS VERY CAREFUL OF HIS MOTHER TOO ONE EVENING SHE HAD TAKEN THE BOYS IN A CARRIAGE TO SEE A BIG ILLUMINATION BANDS WERE PLAYING AND ROCKETS FLYING
ONCE WHEN HE HAD BEEN SENT TO WASHINGTON TO DRAW MAPS FOR THE COAST SURVEY HE FORGOT WHAT HE WAS ABOUT AND FILLED UP THE NICE WHITE MARGINS WITH PERT LITTLE DANCING FOLKS HE WAS WELL SCOLDED FOR THIS I CAN TELL YOU
AND THE MAP DRAWING HAD GROWN SO TIRESOME THAT JAMES HAD GIVEN UP WEST POINT AND SETTLED DOWN TO PAINTING AND ETCHING IN PARIS HE HAD DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WHICH SUITED HIM BUT THE LIFE OF AN ARTIST
IN THIS CITY HE WAS PRAISED EVEN MORE BUT HE DID NOT SELL ENOUGH PICTURES TO PAY HIS BILLS AND ONCE WHEN HE HAD KEPT MEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR MONEY THAT HE OWED THEM OFFICERS CAME AND TOOK EVERYTHING AWAY BUT HIS PICTURES
THERE WAS A TRIAL IN LONDON AND THE COURT ROOM WAS CROWDED SOME WERE THERE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY OWNED WHISTLER PICTURES AND WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD PAID GOOD MONEY FOR BAD PICTURES OTHERS BECAUSE THEY WERE WARM FRIENDS OF THE ARTIST OR THE CRITIC
PICKING UP INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE GREAT CASE AND THE TWO YOUNGER GIRLS HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL REGINALD AS HE WALKED HOME FROM BRAGTON ALL ALONE ON THAT OCCASION WHEN LARRY HAD RETURNED WITH MARY WAS QUITE SURE
THERE WERE MANY REASONS SHE COULD HARDLY GO ON SUCH A VISIT WITHOUT SOME RENEWAL OF HER SCANTY WARDROBE WHICH PERHAPS THE FAMILY FUNDS WOULD NOT PERMIT
I CAN EXPLAIN IT ALL TO HER AND SHE WILL UNDERSTAND ME SHE HARDLY MEANT TO REPROACH HIM SHE DID NOT MEAN TO ASSUME AN INTIMACY SUFFICIENT FOR REPROACH BUT HE FELT THAT SHE HAD REPROACHED HIM
A MAN MAY WISH TO HAVE A LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH A VERY OLD FRIEND WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED AND YET NOT BE GRAND I DARE SAY MISTER TWENTYMAN IS JUST AS GOOD AS I AM
SO HE WALKED BY THE PATH ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND WHEN HE CAME OUT ON THE GRAVEL ROAD NEAR THE FRONT DOOR HE FOUND A GENTLEMAN SMOKING A CIGAR AND LOOKING AROUND HIM
YOU LIVE IN THESE PARTS SIR ASKED THE SENATOR IN THE TOWN YONDER BECAUSE MISTER MORTON'S HOUSEKEEPER SEEMS TO KNOW YOU SHE KNOWS ME VERY WELL AS I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THIS HOUSE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU SIR PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL ME WHO LIVES IN THAT COUNTRY RESIDENCE WHAT YOU CALL A FARM HOUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD REGINALD SAID THAT HE PRESUMED THE GENTLEMAN WAS ALLUDING TO MISTER TWENTYMAN'S HOUSE
AND THAT SHE HAD SAID IT ON PURPOSE TO PUNISH THE MAN WHO WAS TALKING TO HER NOT A DAY PASSED OR HARDLY AN HOUR OF A DAY IN WHICH SHE DID NOT TELL HERSELF THAT THE EDUCATION SHE HAD RECEIVED AND THE EARLY ASSOCIATIONS OF HER LIFE
THE TWO GIRLS HAD BEEN INTENSELY ANXIOUS FOR THE MARRIAGE WISHING TO HAVE LARRY FOR A BROTHER LOOKING FORWARD WITH DELIGHT TO THEIR SHARE IN THE UNRESTRICTED PLENTEOUSNESS OF CHOWTON FARM
LET MARY ONCE BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE A FINE LADY AND THEN SHE WOULD MARRY MISTER TWENTYMAN QUICK ENOUGH BUT THIS USHANTING THIS JOURNEYING TO CHELTENHAM IN ORDER THAT NOTHING MIGHT BE DONE
BUT AT LAST THERE CAME TO HER A GLEAM OF HOPE MOST UNEXPECTEDLY IT HAD BEEN SETTLED THAT MARY SHOULD MAKE HER JOURNEY ON FRIDAY THE TWELFTH FEBRUARY AND THAT REGINALD MORTON WAS AGAIN TO ACCOMPANY HER
NOBODY WOULD EAT HER MISSUS MASTERS DECLARED BUT REGINALD WAS FIRM IN HIS PURPOSE OF ACCOMPANYING HER HE HAD NO OBJECTION WHATEVER TO THE SECOND CLASS IF MISTER MASTERS PREFERRED IT
WHEN THIS WAS RECEIVED THE POOR MAN WAS SMOKING HIS MOODY PIPE IN SILENCE AS HE ROAMED ABOUT HIS OWN FARMYARD IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT
AND HAVING SENT IT OFF BY THE MESSENGER TRIED TO TRUST THAT THERE MIGHT YET BE GROUND FOR HOPE MISSUS MASTERS WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED DOLLY TO SEND SUCH A MESSAGE WITHOUT GOOD REASON
LADY USHANT IS COMING TO BRAGTON I SUPPOSE THAT POOR MAN IS DYING HE IS VERY ILL CERTAINLY
CHAPTER SEVEN THE INQUEST THE CORONER WHO FULLY REALIZED THAT FOR THAT ONE DAY OF HIS LIFE AS A PROVINCIAL SOLICITOR HE WAS LIVING IN THE GAZE OF THE WORLD HAD RESOLVED TO BE WORTHY OF THE FLEETING EMINENCE
PROCEEDED TO DRAW AN ACCOUNT OF THE LAST OCCASION ON WHICH SHE HAD SEEN HER HUSBAND ALIVE MISSUS MANDERSON WAS TAKEN THROUGH HER EVIDENCE BY THE CORONER
AND YOU HEARD NOTHING IN THE NIGHT NO I NEVER WOKE UNTIL MY MAID BROUGHT MY TEA IN THE MORNING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK SHE CLOSED THE DOOR LEADING TO MY HUSBAND'S ROOM AS SHE ALWAYS DID
AND I SUPPOSED HIM TO BE STILL THERE HE ALWAYS NEEDED A GREAT DEAL OF SLEEP HE SOMETIMES SLEPT UNTIL QUITE LATE IN THE MORNING I HAD BREAKFAST IN MY SITTING ROOM IT WAS ABOUT TEN WHEN I HEARD THAT MY HUSBAND'S BODY HAD BEEN FOUND
HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME HAD GIVEN ME GREAT ANXIETY AND SORROW HE HAD CHANGED TOWARDS ME HE HAD BECOME VERY RESERVED AND SEEMED MISTRUSTFUL I SAW MUCH LESS OF HIM THAN BEFORE
HE SEEMED TO PREFER TO BE ALONE I CAN GIVE NO EXPLANATION AT ALL OF THE CHANGE I TRIED TO WORK AGAINST IT I DID ALL I COULD WITH JUSTICE TO MY OWN DIGNITY AS I THOUGHT
THE WORD WAS COLORLESSLY SPOKEN BUT EVERYONE FELT THAT A CRASS MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF CONDUCT IN THE CASE OF A PERSON LIKE MISSUS MANDERSON HAD BEEN VISITED WITH SOME SEVERITY DID SHE KNOW THE CORONER ASKED
SHE SAID IN A VOICE NOW WEAK AND ODDLY BROKEN IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR ARM A PART OF THE WAY TO THE HOUSE I COULD NOT SEE MY UNCLE NEAR THE DOOR AND I SUDDENLY FELT RATHER FAINT I SHALL BE BETTER IN THE AIR
RUSHED THROUGH HIS BRAIN IN A ROUT BUT THE TOUCH OF HER UNNERVED HAND UPON HIS ARM NEVER FOR AN INSTANT LEFT HIS CONSCIOUSNESS FILLING HIM WITH AN EXALTATION THAT ENRAGED AND BEWILDERED HIM
BUT I SAW NOT MY MISTRESS AMONG THEM AND HE SAID O MY LORD THERE IS NONE LEFT SAVE MY MOTHER AND SISTER BUT BY ALLAH I MUST NEEDS HAVE THEM ALSO DOWN AND SHOW THEM TO THEE SO I MARVELLED AT HIS COURTESY AND LARGE HEARTEDNESS AND SAID
MAY I BE THY SACRIFICE BEGIN WITH THE SISTER AND HE ANSWERED WITH JOY AND GOODWILL SO SHE CAME DOWN AND HE SHOWED ME HER HAND AND BEHOLD SHE WAS THE OWNER OF THE HAND AND WRIST QUOTH I
I CONSENT ANSWERED I AND AM HEREWITH CONTENT WHEREUPON HE GAVE ONE OF THE BAGS TO HER AND THE OTHER TO THE WITNESSES AND SAID TO ME O OUR LORD I DESIRE TO ADORN A CHAMBER FOR THEE WHERE THOU MAYST SLEEP WITH THY WIFE
GIVE ME AN ALMS AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHTH NIGHT SHE SAID
THEN HE SAID I CONJURE THEE BY ALLAH ALMIGHTY GIVE ME AN ALMS SO WHEN HE ADJURED HER BY THE HOLY NAME OF ALLAH SHE HAD RUTH ON HIM AND GAVE HIM TWO SCONES
FOR FATIGUE OF WALKING AND FOR GRIEF BUT AS SHE BENT HER HEAD THE CHILD WHICH WAS AT HER NECK FELL INTO THE WATER THEN SHE SAT WEEPING BITTER TEARS FOR HER CHILD AND AS SHE WEPT BEHOLD CAME UP TWO MEN WHO SAID TO HER
WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THIS FISH QUOTH HE WE WILL BROIL IT AND EAT IT TILL IT PLEASE ALLAH TO PROVIDE BREAD FOR US SO THEY TOOK IT AND RIPPING OPEN ITS BELLY FOUND THEREIN A GREAT PEARL AND TOLD THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHO SAID
IT IS WORTH SEVENTY THOUSAND DIRHAMS AND NO MORE THEN HE PAID HIM THAT SUM AND THE JEW HIRED TWO PORTERS TO CARRY THE MONEY TO HIS HOUSE AS HE CAME TO HIS DOOR A BEGGAR ACCOSTED HIM SAYING
IT SHALL BE MINE I ANSWERED BE IT AS THOU WILT AN THUS PLEASE ALLAH ALMIGHTY SO HE BROUGHT OUT A LEATHER BAG AND I SAID TO THE SERVANT FETCH THE SCALES
THAT QUOTH ABU HASSAN AL ZIYADI I CALLED THE PURVEYORS AND PAID THEM MY LIABILITIES AND SPENT FREELY AND AMPLY SAYING TO MYSELF BY THE TIME HE RETURNS ALLAH WILL HAVE RELIEVED ME WITH ONE OR OTHER OF THE BOUNTIES HE HATH BY HIM
BUT SLEEP WAS FORBIDDEN TO ME AND I CEASED NOT TO AWAKEN THE BOY AND HE TO PUT ME OFF TILL BREAK OF DAY WHEN HE SADDLED ME THE MULE AND I MOUNTED AND RODE OUT NOT KNOWING WHITHER TO GO
SO I TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY AND HE WEPT AND SAID BY ALLAH HADDEST THOU TOLD ME THE FACT AT FIRST I HAD NOT PRESSED THEE
THEN HE BECAME A HANGER ON AT THE CLUBS A GENTEEL LOAFER HE USED TO SAY IN HIS SOBER MOMENTS THAT AT LAST HE WAS ONE OF THE BOYS THAT SADNESS HAD SPOKEN OF HE DID NOT WORK
ALTERNATELY WEEPING ALOUD AND QUIVERING WITH DRUNKEN HICCOUGHING SOBS
YOU SHA'N'T LAY AROUND MY HOUSE HE HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO FALL INTO A DRUNKEN SLEEP BUT SHE SHOOK HIM GOT HIM TO HIS FEET AND PUSHED HIM OUTSIDE THE DOOR NOW GO YOU DRUNKEN DOG
AND HE HALF WALKED HALF FELL DOWN THE STREET SADNESS AND SKAGGSY WERE TOGETHER AT THE CLUB THAT NIGHT FIVE YEARS HAD NOT CHANGED THE LATTER AS TO WEALTH OR POSITION OR INCLINATION
HE MOURNED TRULY FOR HIS LOST COMPANION AND TO NIGHT HE WAS IN A PARTICULARLY PENSIVE MOOD SOME ONE WAS PLAYING RAG TIME ON THE PIANO AND THE DANCERS WERE WHEELING IN TIME TO THE MUSIC
YES REPLIED SADNESS AND DANCING IN RAG TIME IS THE DIALECT POETRY THE REPORTER DID NOT LIKE THIS IT SAVOURED OF FLIPPANCY
COME COME WAKE UP HERE THREE MORE JACK WHAT ABOUT YOUR FATHER FATHER
YOU RE DISAPPOINTED ARE N'T YOU I CONFESS I AM DISAPPOINTED
GET OUT OR I LL HAVE YOU TAKEN OUT SHE SPRANG UP IN BED GLARING ANGRILY AT HIM HIS HANDS TWITCHED NERVOUSLY AS IF HER WILL WERE CONQUERING HIM AND HE WERE UNEASY
THE REALISATION OF WHAT HE WAS OF HIS FOULNESS AND DEGRADATION SEEMED JUST TO HAVE COME TO HIM FULLY YOU MADE ME WHAT I AM AND THEN YOU SENT ME AWAY YOU LET ME COME BACK AND NOW YOU PUT ME OUT
THIS WAS A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MAN OR A MONSTER
BUT THIS HE DECLINED AND TAKING HIMSELF AWAY HID HIMSELF ABOUT THE PLACE FOR THE NEXT HOUR AND A HALF DURING THIS TIME HE CONSIDERED MUCH WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO RIDE OR WALK IF SHE SHOULD GIVE HIM ANY HOPE
STAND UP TO HER BOLDLY MAN THE EARL HAD SAID TO HIM BY GEORGE WHAT IS THERE TO BE AFRAID OF
I AM NOT PREPARED TO SAY BUT EAMES TOOK HIS ADVICE AS BEING IN ITSELF GOOD AND RESOLVED TO ACT UPON IT NOT THAT ANY RESOLUTION WILL BE OF ANY USE HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE WALKED ALONG
HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE HATED CROSBIE CALLING HIM THAT MAN AND ASSURING HER THAT NO EARTHLY CONSIDERATION SHOULD INDUCE HIM TO GO INTO THAT MAN'S HOUSE THEN HE HAD WALKED AWAY MOODILY WISHING HIM ALL MANNER OF EVIL
HERE HE ENCOUNTERED HOPKINS
MISTER JOHN MAY I MAKE SO BOLD AND HOPKINS HELD OUT A VERY DIRTY HAND WHICH EAMES OF COURSE TOOK UNCONSCIOUS OF THE CAUSE OF THIS NEW AFFECTION I'M JUST GOING TO CALL AT THE SMALL HOUSE AND I THOUGHT I'D COME THIS WAY
IN THIS FRAME OF MIND HE SLOWLY MADE HIS WAY UP ACROSS THE LAWN MY DEAR THERE IS JOHN EAMES SAID MISSUS DALE WHO HAD FIRST SEEN HIM FROM THE PARLOUR WINDOW DON'T GO MAMMA
AND I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM THEN MISSUS DALE WENT ROUND TO THE OTHER ROOM AND ADMITTED HER VISITOR THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE DRAWING ROOM WE ARE IN TERRIBLE CONFUSION JOHN ARE WE NOT AND SO YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO LIVE IN GUESTWICK
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY I SHOULD SO MUCH LIKE FOR A BROTHER I'M VERY GLAD YOU LIKE HIM VERY GLAD I HOPE YOU'LL BE FRIENDS ALWAYS THERE WAS SOME LITTLE TENDERNESS IN THIS AS JOHN ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF I'M SURE WE SHALL IF HE LIKES IT THAT IS IF I EVER HAPPEN TO SEE HIM
AND FOR THE MOMENT SILENCED HIM YOU THINK HE WOULD HAVE A BETTER CAREER IN LONDON SAID LILY SPEAKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER SUPERIOR PRESENCE OF MIND SHE HAD CERTAINLY SHOWN DEFECTIVE JUDGMENT IN DESIRING HER MOTHER NOT TO LEAVE THEM ALONE
THE PATH PROPOSED LAY RIGHT ACROSS THE FIELD INTO WHICH LILY HAD TAKEN CROSBIE WHEN SHE MADE HER OFFER TO LET HIM OFF FROM HIS ENGAGEMENT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD EVER WALK THERE AGAIN WITH ANOTHER LOVER NO JOHN SHE SAID NOT TO DAY
YOU ARE STRONGER THAN I AM HE SAID NOT STRONGER BUT MORE CERTAIN MAKE YOURSELF AS SURE AS I AM AND YOU TOO WILL BE STRONG IS IT NOT SO MAMMA
I AM NOT BLAMING HIM REMEMBER THESE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT WITH A MAN SHE HAD NOT DROPPED HIS HAND AND AS SHE MADE HER LAST SPEECH WAS SITTING IN HER OLD CHAIR WITH HER EYES FIXED UPON THE GROUND
AND HAD SO MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF THAT NOW ALL HOPE AND HAPPINESS WERE OVER FOR HIM HOW COULD HE ESCAPE AT ONCE OUT OF THE COUNTRY BACK TO LONDON HOW COULD HE GET AWAY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD FURTHER TO ANY ONE
HE CROSSED THE ROAD AT THE END OF THE SQUIRE'S PROPERTY WHERE THE PARISH OF ALLINGTON DIVIDES ITSELF FROM THAT OF ABBOT'S GUEST IN WHICH THE EARL'S HOUSE STANDS AND MADE HIS WAY BACK ALONG THE COPSE WHICH SKIRTED THE FIELD IN WHICH THEY HAD ENCOUNTERED THE BULL
IF YOU CAN BE CONSTANT IN YOUR LOVE YOU MAY WIN HER YET REMEMBER HOW YOUNG SHE IS AND HOW YOUNG YOU BOTH ARE COME AGAIN IN TWO YEARS TIME AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE WON HER YOU SHALL TELL ME THAT I HAVE BEEN A GOOD OLD WOMAN TO YOU BOTH
I SHALL NEVER WIN HER LADY JULIA AS HE SPOKE THESE LAST WORDS THE TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
THAT HER JUNIOR CLASSES WERE THE MOST TRYING OF THE DAY BECAUSE SHE HAD TO WORK HARDER TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE THAN TO TEACH HER SUBJECT THAT'S A NICE REPUTATION TO CARRY AROUND ISN'T IT REMARKED NORA INDIGNANTLY BUT ALL WE CAN DO IS TO TRY HARDER THAN EVER TO MAKE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY
ANNE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE MORE LOVE FOR THE STAGE THAN YOU WILL ADMIT SAID GRACE LAUGHING YOU ARE ALL TAKEN UP WITH THE IDEA OF THIS PLAY IF ONE COULD LIVE IN THE SAME ATMOSPHERE AS THAT OF HOME THEN THERE COULD BE NO PROFESSION MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN THAT OF THE ACTOR REPLIED ANNE THOUGHTFULLY
IT IS WONDERFUL TO FEEL THAT ONE IS ABLE TO FORGET ONE'S SELF AND BECOME SOME ONE ELSE BUT IT IS MORE WONDERFUL TO MAKE ONE'S AUDIENCE FEEL IT TOO TO HAVE THEM FORGET THAT ONE IS ANYTHING EXCEPT THE LIVING BREATHING PERSON WHOSE CHARACTER ONE IS TRYING TO PORTRAY
WHO MADE AN ENTRY ON HER PAD AND BECKONED TO THE GIRL NEXT TO MARIAN TO COME FORWARD STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE HE WENT SOMETIMES STOPPING A GIRL AT HER THIRD OR FOURTH LINE RARELY ALLOWING THEM TO READ FARTHER THAN THE ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH
THEY EXPECTED HER TO LIVE UP TO HER REPUTATION AND SHE HAD SCARCELY DELIVERED THE OPENING LINE BEFORE THEY REALIZED THAT SHE WOULD NOT DISAPPOINT THEM HER MUSICAL VOICE VIBRATED WITH EXPRESSION
ANNE STOOD PERFECTLY STILL LOOKING RATHER DAZED THE UNEXPECTED HAD HAPPENED SHE WAS TO HAVE NOT ONLY A PART BUT THE BEST PART AT THAT THE GIRLS GATHERED EAGERLY ABOUT HER CONGRATULATING HER ON HER SUCCESS
AND YOU CAN WIN PLENTY OF APPLAUSE PLAYING IT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT ONCE HAVING GIVEN OUT A PART I SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE IT FROM THE GIRL I HAD GIVEN IT TO SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME OTHER GIRL DESIRED IT THAT WOULD BE BOTH UNFAIR AND UNJUST
SAW THE TRIO APPROACHING FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE GENTLEMAN IN HIS SUMMER ATTIRE WHEN HE DID SURPRISE THEN PLEASURE THEN A SPIRIT OF INQUIETUDE TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM HE HAD BEEN UNEXPECTEDLY STARTLED ON RUTH'S BIRTHNIGHT
THIS OF ITSELF WILL BRING A SOFTNESS INTO A MAN'S MANNER AND WITHOUT DOUBT HIS FEARS HAD BEEN GROUNDLESS FEARS THAT HE HAD NOT DARED TO PUT INTO WORDS FOR OLD MAN AS HE WAS HE REALIZED THAT DOCTOR KEMP'S STRONG PERSONALITY
KEMP GRASPED HIS HAND HEARTILY I AM A SORT OF SURPRISE PARTY HE ANSWERED SWINGING ETHEL TO THE GROUND AND WATCHING HER SCAMPER OFF TO THE HOTEL AND WHAT IS MORE HE CONTINUED TURNING TO HIM I HAVE NOT BROUGHT A HAMPER WHICH MAKES ONE OF ME
NOW WHEN HE DECIDEDLY OBJECTED TO MOVING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARTLESS NOT TO GO DON'T CONSIDER ME SAID THE DOCTOR OBSERVING HIS HESITANCY IF IT ILL RELIEVE YOU I ASSURE YOU I SHALL NOT MISS YOU IN THE LEAST GO RIGHT AHEAD JULES URGED HIS WIFE
HE HARDLY APPRECIATED WHAT AN ADMIRABLE AIDE HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM IN HIS WIFE KEMP SAT UPON THE TOP STEP AND LEANED HIS BACK AGAINST THE RAILING
WHO SWAYED TO AND FRO IN HER ROCKER HE WAS INTENTLY CONSCIOUS OF RUTH'S WHITE FIGURE PERCHED ON THE WINDOW SILL
IF DOCTOR KEMP WISHED TO ROW HE SHOULD ROW AND SINCE THE JEWISH MISSUS GRUNDY WAS NOT ON HAND ANYTHING HARMLESSLY ENJOYABLE WAS PERMISSIBLE RUTH WENT INDOORS THIS WAS CERTAINLY SOMETHING SHE HAD NOT BARGAINED FOR
HE GENTLY LIFTED HER RESISTING FINGERS ONE BY ONE AND RAISED THE BROAD BONE OF CONTENTION TO HIS SHOULDER
AND SEATED THUS KEMP'S KNEES WERE NOT HALF A FOOT FROM RUTH'S WHITE GOWN WILL YOU DIRECT ME HE SAID AS HE SWEPT AROUND I HAVE NOT ROWED ON THIS RIVER FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS YOU CAN KEEP STRAIGHT AHEAD FOR SOME DISTANCE SHE SAID LEANING BACK IN HER SEAT
AS FOR M DANGLARS ABSORBED IN AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITH M CAVALCANTI HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THAT WAS PASSING
HAD OFFERED HIM A SEAT IN HIS CARRIAGE ANDREA CAVALCANTI FOUND HIS TILBURY WAITING AT THE DOOR THE GROOM IN EVERY RESPECT A CARICATURE OF THE ENGLISH FASHION
HE CONTEMPLATED WITH UNSPEAKABLE DELIGHT THE LARGE DIAMOND WHICH SHONE ON THE MAJOR'S LITTLE FINGER FOR THE MAJOR LIKE A PRUDENT MAN IN CASE OF ANY ACCIDENT HAPPENING TO HIS BANK NOTES HAD IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED THEM INTO AN AVAILABLE ASSET
THEN AFTER DINNER ON THE PRETEXT OF BUSINESS HE QUESTIONED THE FATHER AND SON UPON THEIR MODE OF LIVING AND THE FATHER AND SON PREVIOUSLY INFORMED THAT IT WAS THROUGH DANGLARS THE ONE WAS TO RECEIVE HIS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS
AS FOR ANDREA HE BEGAN BY WAY OF SHOWING OFF TO SCOLD HIS GROOM WHO INSTEAD OF BRINGING THE TILBURY TO THE STEPS OF THE HOUSE HAD TAKEN IT TO THE OUTER DOOR THUS
AND WHICH WAS THE FIRST THING ANDREA SAW SEEMED OF GIGANTIC SIZE DID THE YOUNG MAN RECOGNIZE THAT FACE BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN IN HIS TILBURY
SAID THE GROOM ENDEAVORING TO RID HIS MASTER OF THE TROUBLESOME INTRUDER I AM NOT BEGGING MY FINE FELLOW SAID THE UNKNOWN TO THE SERVANT WITH SO IRONICAL AN EXPRESSION OF THE EYE AND SO FRIGHTFUL A SMILE THAT HE WITHDREW
I ONLY WISH TO SAY TWO OR THREE WORDS TO YOUR MASTER WHO GAVE ME A COMMISSION TO EXECUTE ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AGO COME SAID ANDREA WITH SUFFICIENT NERVE FOR HIS SERVANT NOT TO PERCEIVE HIS AGITATION WHAT DO YOU WANT
BUT INSTEAD OF THAT YOU COME TO PARIS HOW DOES THAT ANNOY YOU IT DOES NOT ON THE CONTRARY I THINK IT WILL ANSWER MY PURPOSE SO SAID ANDREA
I THOUGHT YOU WERE EARNING A LIVING IN TUSCANY OR PIEDMONT BY ACTING AS FACCHINO OR CICERONE AND I PITIED YOU SINCERELY AS I WOULD A CHILD OF MY OWN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS DID CALL YOU MY CHILD
YOU MUST HAVE DISCOVERED A MINE OR ELSE BECOME A STOCKBROKER SO THAT AS YOU CONFESS YOU ARE JEALOUS NO I AM PLEASED SO PLEASED THAT I WISHED TO CONGRATULATE YOU
I CHOSE MY OPPORTUNITY THAT I MIGHT NOT COMPROMISE YOU
THAT IS NOT RIGHT TAKE CARE OR I MAY BECOME TROUBLESOME THIS MENACE SMOTHERED THE YOUNG MAN'S PASSION HE URGED THE HORSE AGAIN INTO A TROT
I THINK THAT WITH A HUNDRED FRANCS A MONTH WELL I COULD LIVE UPON A HUNDRED FRANCS COME YOU UNDERSTAND ME
SINCE HE HOLDS THE MONEY CHEST WELL I WILL MENTION YOU TO HIM MEANWHILE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
YES YOU IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT ME SINCE YOU INTEREST YOURSELF IN MY AFFAIRS I THINK IT IS NOW MY TURN TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS AH TRUE
AND GOOD BY TO MY DREAM OF RESEMBLING THE RETIRED BAKER NO NO MY BOY I PREFER REMAINING HONORABLY IN THE CAPITAL ANDREA SCOWLED CERTAINLY
BUT HOW WILL YOU PASS THROUGH THE BARRIER WITHOUT EXCITING SUSPICION IT SEEMS TO ME
I HOPE I AM NOT THE CAUSE HUSH SAID ANDREA THEY PASSED THE BARRIER WITHOUT ACCIDENT AT THE FIRST CROSS STREET
AND IT'S BEEN SO SNOWY SHE HASN'T THOUGHT BEST TO TRY TO GET OVER TO THE HOUSE MAYBE AUNT HANNAH WOULD COME TOO FOR LUNCHEON WOULD SHE I'M AFRAID NOT RETURNED BILLY WITH A RUEFUL LAUGH SHE'S GOT THREE SHAWLS ON THIS MORNING
BILLY REALLY I THINK WE SHOULD TURN BACK BUT BILLY WOULD NOT TURN BACK AND AT LAST THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE PRESENCE OF A WHITE HAIRED SWEET FACED WOMAN WHO SAID YES SHE WAS MISSUS GREGGORY YES SHE WAS EVEN AS SHE UTTERED THE WORDS
AND THERE'S THE TRAY DID YOU NOTICE HE EXULTED TURNING BACK TO THE SHELF YOU DON'T SEE THAT EVERY DAY THEY GET SEPARATED MOST GENERALLY YOU KNOW THESE PIECES HAVE BEEN IN OUR FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS SAID MISSUS GREGGORY WITH AN ACCENT OF PRIDE
AND THAT IT WILL BRING IN MONEY AND WE NEED MONEY SHE THREW A QUICK GLANCE TOWARD THE HALL DOOR THOUGH SHE DID NOT PAUSE IN HER REMARKS I CAN'T DO MUCH AT WORK THAT PAYS I SEW SHE NODDED TOWARD THE MACHINE BY THE WINDOW
SHE FINISHED WITH A WISTFUL WHIMSICALITY BILLY TURNED AWAY SHARPLY THERE WAS A LUMP IN HER THROAT AND A SMART IN HER EYES SHE WAS CONSCIOUS SUDDENLY OF A FIERCE ANGER AGAINST SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT EXACTLY BUT SHE FANCIED IT WAS AGAINST THE TEAPOT
BROUGHT OF COURSE IF IT'S WORTH THAT TO YOU SHE PAUSED SUDDENLY A QUICK STEP HAD SOUNDED IN THE HALL OUTSIDE THE NEXT MOMENT THE DOOR FLEW OPEN
MOTHER ONLY THINK I'VE SHE STOPPED AND DREW BACK A LITTLE HER STARTLED EYES WENT FROM ONE FACE TO ANOTHER THEN DROPPED TO THE LOWESTOFT TEAPOT IN THE MAN'S HANDS HER EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE SHE SHUT THE DOOR QUICKLY AND HURRIED FORWARD
MOTHER WHAT IS IT WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE SHE ASKED SHARPLY BILLY LIFTED HER CHIN THE LEAST BIT SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FEELING WHICH SHE COULD NOT NAME BILLY WAS NOT USED TO BEING CALLED THESE PEOPLE IN PRECISELY THAT TONE OF VOICE
STAMMERED MISSUS GREGGORY WETTING HER LIPS WITH AN AIR OF HURRIED APOLOGY AND CONCILIATION THIS GENTLEMAN SAYS HE WILL BE GLAD TO BUY IT ER MY DAUGHTER ALICE MISTER HENSHAW SHE HASTENED ON IN EMBARRASSED INTRODUCTION AND MISS
NEILSON SUPPLIED THE MAN AS SHE LOOKED AT BILLY AND HESITATED A SWIFT RED STAINED ALICE GREGGORY'S FACE WITH BARELY AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE INTRODUCTIONS SHE TURNED TO HER MOTHER YES DEAR BUT THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY NOW
BUT ALICE MY DEAR SHE ALMOST SOBBED YOU DIDN'T WAIT TO LET ME TELL YOU
I CAN'T HELP IT STORMED THE GIRL HOTLY I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU THINK OF THAT TEAPOT THAT WAS GRANDMOTHER'S I KNOW WHAT IT COST YOU TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO SELL IT AT ALL AND THEN TO HEAR THESE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT YOUR WISHING TO SELL IT
WITH A LITTLE OUTWARD FLING OF HER TWO HANDS ALICE GREGGORY STEPPED BACK HER FACE HAD GROWN WHITE AGAIN I BEG YOUR PARDON OF COURSE SHE SAID IN A VOICE THAT WAS BITTERLY QUIET I SHOULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN SO
YOU ARE VERY KIND MISTER HENSHAW BUT I DO NOT THINK WE CARE TO SELL THE LOWESTOFT TO DAY BOTH WORDS AND MANNER WERE OBVIOUSLY A DISMISSAL AND WITH A PUZZLED SIGH WILLIAM HENSHAW PICKED UP HIS HAT HIS FACE SHOWED VERY CLEARLY THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO
COME BILLY WE'LL BID YOU GOOD MORNING LADIES SAID WILLIAM HENSHAW THEN DECISIVELY AND BILLY WITH A LITTLE WISTFUL PAT ON MISSUS GREGGORY'S CLASPED HANDS WENT ONCE DOWN THE LONG FOUR FLIGHTS OF STAIRS AND OUT ON THE SIDEWALK
AND IT WAS HE THAT OWNED THE CHURCHES IN THE EARLY DAYS THE KING YOU SEE WAS THE RIGHT SORT HE WAS THE REAL BOY AND LOVED SPORT AS HE LOVED HIS LIFE AND HUNTING IN PARTICULAR AND FROM THE RISING O THE SUN UP HE GOT AND AWAY HE WENT OVER THE MOUNTAINS AFTER THE DEER
YOU SEE IT WAS SAINT KAVIN SURE ENOUGH THE SAINT HIMSELF IN DISGUISE AND NOBODY ELSE OH NEVER MIND SAYS HE I KNOW MORE THAN THAT
AND HOW IS IT YOU MAKE YOUR MONEY SO AISY
SAYS SAINT KAVIN FOR MAKING HER THE LIKE BY JABERS SAYS THE KING I SAY NOTHING BEATS THE ART O MAN BARRING THE BEES AND DO YOU SAY NO MORE NOR THAT SAYS SAINT KAVIN AND THAT I'M BEHOLDEN TO YOU SAYS THE KING
I WILL SAYS KING O'TOOLE AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO IT SAYS HE THOUGH IT'S THE LAST ACRE I HAVE TO GIVE BUT YOU'LL KEEP YOUR WORD TRUE SAYS THE SAINT AS TRUE AS THE SUN SAYS THE KING IT'S WELL FOR YOU KING O'TOOLE THAT YOU SAID THAT WORD SAYS HE
THAT I'VE BEEN DISCOURSING ALL THIS TIME WITHOUT KNOWING IT SAYS HE
AS IN FACT ALREADY AND MORE THAN ONCE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE VERY EVENTS THIS LESSON HAS OBTAINED THE EFFECTUAL ATTENTION OF CHRISTIAN KINGS AND PRINCES ASSEMBLED IN CONGRESS
IN A STRENGTH LIKE THAT OF A WEST INDIAN HURRICANE AND WHICH DID SERIOUSLY THREATEN AT ONE TIME TO DEPOPULATE OUR UNIVERSITY THROUGH THE DARK SUSPICIONS WHICH SETTLED UPON ITS MEMBERS AND THE NATURAL REACTION OF GENEROUS INDIGNATION IN REPELLING THEM
BY SACRIFICING WHENEVER CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOWED THEM THEIR HOUSES AND BEAUTIFUL GARDENS IN EXCHANGE FOR DAYS UNCURSED BY PANIC AND NIGHTS UNPOLLUTED BY BLOOD NOTHING I CAN TAKE UPON MYSELF TO ASSERT
DOORS OPEN THAT SHOULD BE SHUT OR UNLOCKED THAT SHOULD BE TRIPLY SECURED THE VERY WALLS GONE BARRIERS SWALLOWED UP BY UNKNOWN ABYSSES NOTHING AROUND ONE BUT FRAIL CURTAINS AND A WORLD OF ILLIMITABLE NIGHT
IN THAT RESPECT THEREFORE I HAD AN ADVANTAGE BEING UPON THE SPOT THROUGH THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE AFFAIR FOR GIVING A FAITHFUL NARRATIVE AS I HAD STILL MORE EMINENTLY FROM THE SORT OF CENTRAL STATION WHICH I OCCUPIED
A NOBLEMAN CONNECTED WITH THE DIPLOMACY OF RUSSIA FROM WHICH I QUOTE AN EXTRACT I WISH IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND TO YOUR ATTENTIONS AND IN TERMS STRONGER THAN I KNOW HOW TO DEVISE
A YOUNG MAN ON WHOSE BEHALF THE CZAR HIMSELF IS PRIVATELY KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED THE VERY STRONGEST INTEREST HE WAS AT THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AS AN AIDE DE CAMP TO A DUTCH GENERAL OFFICER AND IS DECORATED WITH DISTINCTIONS WON UPON THAT AWFUL DAY
AND TEN YEARS HENCE YOU WILL LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE UPON HAVING CONTRIBUTED YOUR PART TO THE FORMATION OF ONE WHOM ALL HERE AT SAINT PETERSBURG NOT SOLDIERS ONLY BUT WE DIPLOMATES LOOK UPON AS CERTAIN TO PROVE A GREAT MAN
THAT ALL WAS CLOSED BEFORE THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND WHEN ONCE THAT CONSUMMATION WAS ATTAINED I THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BREATHED NO SYLLABLE OF WHAT WAS STIRRING NOW GAVE LOOSE TO THE INTERESTING TIDINGS AND SUFFERED THEM TO SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE COMPASS OF THE TOWN
THEN A SOLDIER COVERED WITH BRILLIANT DISTINCTIONS AND IN THE MOST BRILLIANT ARM OF THE SERVICE YOUNG MOREOVER AND YET A VETERAN BY HIS EXPERIENCE FRESH FROM THE MOST AWFUL BATTLE OF THIS PLANET SINCE THE DAY OF PHARSALIA
ON HIS ARRIVAL AT MY HOUSE I BECAME SENSIBLE OF A TRUTH WHICH I HAD OBSERVED SOME YEARS BEFORE THE COMMONPLACE MAXIM IS THAT IT IS DANGEROUS TO RAISE EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH THIS
WHICH IS THUS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AND WITHOUT LIMITATION IS TRUE ONLY CONDITIONALLY IT IS TRUE THEN AND THERE ONLY WHERE THERE IS BUT LITTLE MERIT TO SUSTAIN AND JUSTIFY THE EXPECTATION BUT IN ANY CASE WHERE THE MERIT IS TRANSCENDENT OF ITS KIND
UNIVERSALLY RECEIVED WITH FAVOR AND DISTINCTION IN REALITY HIS WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE HIS MILITARY HONORS AND THE DIGNITY OF HIS CHARACTER AS EXPRESSED IN HIS MANNERS AND DEPORTMENT
HAD COMMUNICATED TO HIS MANNERS A MORE THAN MILITARY FRANKNESS BUT THE PROFOUND MELANCHOLY WHICH POSSESSED HIM FROM WHATEVER CAUSE IT AROSE NECESSARILY CHILLED THE NATIVE FREEDOM OF HIS DEMEANOR
NOT AN EYE BUT WAS DIRECTED UPON HIM OR ELSE SUNK IN TIMIDITY SETTLED UPON THE FLOOR AND YOUNG LADIES SERIOUSLY LOST THE POWER FOR A TIME OF DOING MORE THAN MURMURING A FEW CONFUSED HALF INARTICULATE SYLLABLES
WERE THERE THEN NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS CONDITION OF AWESTRUCK ADMIRATION YES
NEVER WAS THERE SO VICTORIOUS A CONQUEST INTERCHANGED BETWEEN TWO YOUTHFUL HEARTS NEVER BEFORE SUCH A RAPTURE OF INSTANTANEOUS SYMPATHY I DID NOT WITNESS THE FIRST MEETING OF THIS MYSTERIOUS MAXIMILIAN AND THIS MAGNIFICENT MARGARET
AND FOR A MERE POSSIBILITY WHICH HE HAD LONG TOO DEEPLY CONTEMPLATED FEARING HOWEVER THAT IN HIS OWN CASE IT MIGHT PROVE A CHIMERA OR THAT HE MIGHT NEVER MEET A WOMAN ANSWERING THE DEMANDS OF HIS HEART HE NOW FOUND A CORRESPONDING REALITY THAT LEFT NOTHING TO SEEK
NOT DAZZLING BUT RESPECTABLE AND SO AMIABLE WERE HIS TEMPER AND MANNERS THAT I HAD INTRODUCED HIM EVERYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE HE WAS A FAVORITE AND EVERYWHERE INDEED EXCEPT EXACTLY THERE WHERE ONLY IN THIS WORLD HE CARED FOR FAVOR
SHE IT WAS WHOM HE LOVED AND HAD LOVED FOR YEARS WITH THE WHOLE ARDOR OF HIS ARDENT SOUL SHE IT WAS FOR WHOM OR AT WHOSE COMMAND HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DIED EARLY HE HAD FELT THAT IN HER HANDS LAY HIS DESTINY
FOR THE COSTLINESS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF OFFICIAL PRIDE DONE IN HONOR OF THE CITY NOT AS AN EFFORT OF PERSONAL DISPLAY IT FOLLOWED FROM THE SPIRIT IN WHICH THESE HALF YEARLY DANCES ORIGINATED
THAT BEING GIVEN ON THE PART OF THE CITY EVERY STRANGER OF RANK WAS MARKED OUT AS A PRIVILEGED GUEST AND THE HOSPITALITY OF THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUALLY AFFRONTED BY FAILING TO OFFER OR BY FAILING TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION
AND THAT ALSO I THINK WAS THE MOST JOYOUS OF ALL THE BANQUETS I EVER WITNESSED THE ACCOMPLISHED GUARDSMAN OUTSHONE HIMSELF IN BRILLIANCY EVEN HIS MELANCHOLY RELAXED IN FACT HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE
THE MUSIC AGAIN BEGAN TO POUR ITS VOLUPTUOUS TIDES THROUGH THE BOUNDING PULSES OF THE YOUTHFUL COMPANY AGAIN THE FLYING FEET OF THE DANCERS BEGAN TO RESPOND TO THE MEASURES
NOW RUSHED TUMULTUOUSLY OUT OF THE BALLROOM TO SATISFY THEMSELVES ON THE SPOT THE DISTANCE WAS NOT GREAT AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES SEVERAL PERSONS RETURNED HASTILY AND CRIED OUT TO THE CROWD OF LADIES THAT ALL WAS TRUE WHICH THE YOUNG GIRL HAD SAID
WHAT WAS TRUE THAT HER UNCLE MISTER WEISHAUPT'S FAMILY HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT NOT ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY HAD BEEN SPARED NAMELY MISTER WEISHAUPT HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE NEITHER OF THEM MUCH ABOVE SIXTY
AN INCIDENT HAPPENED DURING THE RECITAL OF THESE HORRORS AND OF THE DETAILS WHICH FOLLOWED THAT FURNISHED MATTER FOR CONVERSATION EVEN IN THESE HOURS WHEN SO THRILLING AN INTEREST HAD POSSESSION OF ALL MINDS MANY LADIES FAINTED AMONG THEM
AND YET THE PRUDES COMPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A LOOK OF LOVE EXCHANGED BETWEEN HERSELF AND MAXIMILIAN THAT OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ESCAPED HER IN SUCH A SITUATION IF THEY MEANT BY SUCH A SITUATION ONE SO PUBLIC
THOSE PARTS OF THE TRACES WHICH LAY UPON THE BLACK TESSELLAE BEING LESS DISTINCT IN THE OUTLINE THAN THE OTHERS UPON THE WHITE OR COLORED MOST UNQUESTIONABLY SO FAR AS THIS WENT IT FURNISHED A NEGATIVE CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOR OF THE NEGRO
HE CONTENDED THAT HE HAD HIMSELF BEEN AMONG THE CROWD THAT PUSHED INTO THE HOUSE ALONG WITH THE MAGISTRATES THAT FROM HIS PREVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ROOMS AND THEIR ORDINARY CONDITION
ATTACKED THEM SINGLY IN FLIGHT FOR IN THIS FIRST CASE ALL BUT ONE OF THE MURDERED PERSONS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THE STREET DOOR AND IN ALL THIS THERE WAS NO SUBJECT FOR WONDER EXCEPT THE ORIGINAL ONE AS TO THE MOTIVE
ALL COMBINATION WITH OTHER TOWNS BEING UNAVAILING FROM THEIR GREAT DISTANCE OUR SITUATION WAS NO ORDINARY ONE HAD THERE BEEN SOME MYSTERIOUS ROBBERS AMONG US THE CHANCES OF A VISIT DIVIDED AMONG SO MANY
FROM THE ROLL OF THOSE WHO WERE LIABLE TO A VISIT WHILE SUCH AS KNEW THEMSELVES LIABLE WOULD HAVE HAD WARNING OF THEIR DANGER IN THE FACT OF BEING RICH AND WOULD FROM THE VERY RICHES WHICH CONSTITUTED THAT DANGER HAVE DERIVED THE MEANS OF REPELLING IT BUT AS THINGS WERE
TRUE THEY WERE BIGOTED IN A DEGREE WHICH INDICATED FEEBLENESS OF INTELLECT BUT THAT WOUNDED NO MAN IN PARTICULAR WHILE TO MANY IT RECOMMENDED THEM TRUE THEIR CHARITY WAS NARROW AND EXCLUSIVE BUT TO THOSE OF THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS BODY IT EXPANDED MUNIFICENTLY
HE NEVER ASKS QUESTIONS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S TROUBLES HE NOW BUSIED HIMSELF IN THOUGHT HAVEN'T YOU ANY OF YOUR AMATEUR THEATRICAL DUDS HERE WAS THE OUTCOME OF HIS COGITATIONS ALL OF'EM
WHY NOT DRESS A PART AND WALK AWAY INCOGNITO OH CERTAINLY ASSENTED THE OTHER WITH BITTERNESS PUT ON A SUIT OF TIGHTS AND DIVE OUT OF THE CONSERVATORY WINDOW DISGUISED AS ANNETTE KELLERMAN I SUPPOSE
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH AN OLD MAN MAKEUP AND THE FRONT DOOR JUST THIS FRIEND MURPHY ON WATCH HAULS OUT HIS LITTLE PAPER AND ON THE CHANCE OF ITS BEING ME SLAPS THE WRIST OF ANYBODY WHO APPEARS ON THOSE STEPS
PRESENTLY YOU WILL BE SEEN COMING DOWN AGAIN UNABLE TO EFFECT AN ENTRANCE AGAINST THE WATCHFULNESS OF THE FAITHFUL CONNOR
I'M KEEPING OPEN HOUSE FOR A SPECIAL REASON TWO FELLOWS I KNOW ARE GETTING MARRIED TO MORROW IT'S A DOUBLE WEDDING IT'S ALSO A DOUBLE HONEYMOON BUT THEY AREN'T ONTO THAT YET HARMON'S CLEAR BROWN EYES TWINKLED
NOT KNOW A MAN WITH WHOM YOU TOURED FOR TWO MONTHS IN JAPAN SAID REMSEN REPROACHFULLY STUPID OF ME CONFESSED HARMON GRINNING CARTERET GOOD OLD RODDY CERTAINLY THEN I'D BETTER CAPTURE YOU
IT WAS DONE ALMOST AS WELL AS THAT ACCOMPLISHED ACTOR MISTER JACOB REMSEN COULD HAVE DONE IT HARMON SPRANG ACROSS THE STREET
THE ELUDER OF JUSTICE EYED THEM AND DREW HIS OWN CONCLUSIONS HERE WE ARE ALL OF US HE SAID TO HIMSELF RETIRING DISCREETLY BEHIND HIS NEWSPAPER
HE WAS A HARVARD SOPHOMORE AND REALIZED HIS OWN IMPORTANCE QUITE AS MUCH AS THE GIRLS DID BUT STILL THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT HE WOULD COME INTO THE ROOM JUST FOR A MINUTE AND TELL THEM SOME OF THE LATEST CAMBRIDGE NEWS
AND HE WOULD GROW ALMOST ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN DESCRIBING THE TUSSLE BETWEEN NED BROWN AND STANLEY HOOPER OVER THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF BOSTON AND NEW YORK IN WHICH HOOPER THE NEW YORKER WAS TERRIBLY BEATEN AND UPON MY WORD HE CONCLUDED
I SHOULD SAY NOT EXCLAIMED NORA BUT BELLE WHO HAD SOME NEW YORK COUSINS WAS SILENT BRENDA HOWEVER NOTICING BELLE'S EXPRESSION AND NOT FEELING DISPOSED TO SIDE COMPLETELY WITH NORA SAID
OH IT GIVES A FELLOW A CHANCE TO SHOW WHAT KIND OF STUFF HE'S MADE OF EXPLAINED PHILIP WHETHER HE HAS GOOD MANNERS AND WHETHER HE'S CLEVER AND ALL THAT THERE MUST BE BETTER WAYS OF SHOWING BRAVERY
SAID THE PRACTICAL EDITH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT WILL HARDON'S BRAVERY THAN YOU DID BEFORE WE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT HIS MANNERS WHAT WHY WHEN HE SAW WHERE HE WAS HE DIDN'T RUN AWAY OR FLUNK OUT
OH SEE HERE IT WOULD JUST SPOIL EVERYTHING TO HAVE WOMEN IN THE CLASSES WITH US ARE YOU AFRAID THEY'D GET AHEAD OF YOU ASKED EDITH GENTLY NOW LOOK HERE EDITH
INTERRUPTED PHILIP I'VE HEARD THAT SOME PROFESSORS SAY THAT THEIR ANNEX CLASSES DO BETTER WORK THAN OURS BUT ANYBODY CAN TELL THAT THAT'S ALL ROT I BELIEVE IT'S ALL PERFECTLY TRUE SAID NORA
SO WE CAN SIT UP LATE WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY WELL YOU'LL SEE ME SURE SAID PHILIP BUT SEE HERE IT'S FIVE O'CLOCK NOW AND I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT DOWN TOWN
THOUGH ONLY ABOUT FOUR YEARS THEIR SENIOR HE SEEMED MUCH OLDER THAN BRENDA AND HER FRIENDS YEARS BEFORE THEY HAD ALL BEEN PLAYMATES TOGETHER BUT HIS TWO YEARS IN COLLEGE HAD TAKEN HIM AWAY FROM THEM
AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HE CONDESCENDED TO SPEND AS LONG A TIME IN THEIR PRESENCE AS HAD BEEN THE CASE THIS AFTERNOON DO YOU THINK THAT PHILIP LOOKS VERY WELL EDITH
REPLIED PHILIP'S SISTER IT SEEMED TO ME HE WAS JUST A LITTLE PALE HE IS ALWAYS PALE SAID EDITH DO YOU SUPPOSE HE SITS UP TOO LATE ASKED BRENDA I'LL WARRANT HE DOESN'T STUDY TOO MUCH SAID BELLE
FOR A WEEK BEFORE THANKSGIVING THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AMONG THE SCHOOLGIRLS ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPROACHING FOOTBALL GAME THE FOUR WERE AS EXCITED AS THE OTHERS ALTHOUGH NOT SO MANY OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR FRIENDS WERE IN THE HARVARD TEAM
IT WAS TO BE A GAME WITH PRINCETON ONE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY MATCHES AND FOR SPECIAL REASONS THERE WAS THE DEEPEST INTEREST IN THE MATCH THOSE GIRLS WHO HAD BROTHERS IN COLLEGE OR EVEN COUSINS OR FRIENDS HELD THEMSELVES WITH MORE DIGNITY THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS
THE GIRLS WERE MAKING UP LITTLE GROUPS TO GO TO THE GAME WITH YOUTHS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AS ESCORTS UNDER THE CHAPERONAGE OF OLDER PEOPLE A FEW WHO HAD RECEIVED NO INVITATION WERE ESPECIALLY MISERABLE AND TOOK NO TROUBLE TO DISGUISE THEIR FEELINGS
FOR OF COURSE IN THE MINDS OF THE OTHERS THERE COULD BE BUT ONE GAME
WHY WHO IS IT CRIED BRENDA AND WHO IS IT ECHOED BELLE I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T GUESS OH DON'T BE SILLY NORA IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH WHILE TO GUESS ABOUT SOMETHING YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT SO SOON
THEN BELLE ADDED A FINAL WORD OH IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS IS ALL JULIA'S DOINGS
BUT I DON'T SEE TURNING RATHER SNAPPISHLY TOWARDS BRENDA WHY THE REST OF US HAVE GOT TO TAKE UP RUTH ROBERTS JUST BECAUSE YOUR COUSIN JULIA IS SO DEVOTED TO HER NOW THIS WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH EVEN FOR BRENDA
WHY IT'S A DUTY TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO HELP YOUR OWN SIDE I NEVER SAID THAT HARVARD WAS MY SIDE INTERRUPTED BELLE DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE A COUSIN ON THE PRINCETON TEAM YOU'D BETTER NOT SAY ANYTHING OF THAT KIND TO PHILIP
OR TO EDITH EITHER THEY ARE BOTH PERFECTLY DEVOTED TO HARVARD AND THEY EXPECT THEIR PARTY TO GIVE GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE HARVARD TEAM WHY BELLE I CANNOT IMAGINE YOUR DOING ANYTHING ELSE I'M NOT A CHILD RESPONDED BELLE VERY CROSSLY
RUTH WAS A PRETTY AND AMIABLE GIRL ABOUT JULIA'S AGE AND THEREFORE A LITTLE OLDER THAN THE FOUR SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE COMING OF JULIA BUT IN ALL THAT TIME SHE HAD HAD ONLY A SPEAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE OTHER GIRLS
NO ONE WHO SAW THE HEARTY WAY IN WHICH NORA AND BRENDA GREETED RUTH AS SHE CAME UP WITH EDITH AND JULIA COULD FOR A MOMENT HAVE IMAGINED THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION THE MERCURIAL BRENDA FOR THE MOMENT
AND FELL TO WITH KNIFE AND FORK AT THE GOOD THINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT HAD A BITE TO EAT FOR A WEEK OF SUNDAYS I AM THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD SAYS THE LITTLE OLD MAN AFTER A WHILE I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT SAYS THE FIDDLER YOU MAY WELL BE SAID THE OLD MAN
THERE IN A CORNER BY THE WALL WAS A GREAT TRAP DOOR OF IRON THE OLD MAN FITTED THE KEY TO THE LOCK AND TURNED IT HE LIFTED THE DOOR AND THEN WENT DOWN A STEEP FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AND THE FIDDLER FOLLOWED CLOSE AT HIS HEELS
DOWN BELOW IT WAS AS LIGHT AS DAY FOR IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM HUNG A GREAT LAMP THAT SHONE WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT
PERHAPS I CAN SEE WHAT IS THERE WITHOUT OPENING THE DOOR SO DOWN HE TOOK THE KEY AND OFF HE MARCHED TO THE GARDEN HE OPENED THE TRAP DOOR AND WENT DOWN THE STEEP STEPS TO THE ROOM BELOW THERE WAS THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE ROOM
BUT WHEN HE CAME TO LOOK THERE WAS NO KEY HOLE TO IT
THAT WAS A VERY FINE THING TO SAY BUT BEFORE AN HOUR HAD GONE BY THE FIDDLER'S HEAD BEGAN TO HUM AND BUZZ LIKE A BEEHIVE I DON'T BELIEVE SAID HE THERE WOULD BE A GRAIN OF HARM IN MY PEEPING INSIDE THAT DOOR ALL THE SAME
AND LISTEN AND SO HE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM WELL HE WENT ON AND ON UNTIL POP THERE HE WAS OUT AT THE FARTHER END AND BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HE HAD STEPPED OUT UPON THE SEA SHORE
AND A RHETORICIAN AN ASTRONOMER AN ASTROLOGER AND A PHILOSOPHER AS WELL TIS A LONG LIST OF EXCELLENCY SAID OLD BIDPAI
THERE THEY BEGAN TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND THE SERVANT POPPED THE PEBBLE INTO HIS MOUTH TO HEAR WHAT THEY MIGHT SAY YONDER IS A TRAVELLER IN THE WORLD SAID THE FIRST RAVEN YES SAID THE SECOND
WHY THUS SAID THE SECOND
AND THERE HE WOULD FIND A MAN SITTING
THAT MAN WOULD LEAD HIM TO THE GARDEN
AND THE TIME IS NONE TOO LONG TO GET THERE SO ALL THE REST OF THAT DAY THEY JOURNEYED ONWARD TOGETHER UNTIL TOWARDS EVENING THEY CAME TO A TOWN WITH HIGH TOWERS AND STEEP ROOFS AND TALL SPIRES
THEN WHEN ALL BUT THEY TWO WERE TIGHT AND FAST ASLEEP
TO SEE WHAT HIS COMRADE WAS ABOUT
HE SEEMED TO DOUBT NOTHING NOR FEAR NOTHING BUT TRUDGED STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL BY AND BY THEY SAW A LIGHT TWINKLING FAR AWAY AND WHEN THEY CAME TO IT THEY FOUND A GLOOMY STONE HOUSE AS UGLY AS EYES EVER LOOKED UPON
TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF AT WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE OLD WOMAN GAVE THEM SOME BREAD AND MEAT TO EAT AND THEN HID THEM AWAY IN THE GREAT EMPTY MEAL CHEST IN THE CORNER AND THERE THEY LAY AS STILL AS MICE
THEN HE LED THE WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE AND IF THE SERVING MAN HAD WONDERED THE DAY BEFORE AT THAT WHICH THE COMRADE DID HE WONDERED TEN TIMES MORE TO SEE HIM GIVE SO BEAUTIFUL A RING
FOR I HAVE A BIT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE I LEAVE THIS PLACE AND STRANGE WORK IT WAS
ALL WAS A RED BLAZE BEHIND THEM
ON THEY JOGGED AND BY THE TIME EVENING WAS AT HAND THEY HAD COME TO A NEAT COTTAGE
THE GARDEN AND THE TORRENT AND ALL WERE GONE AND NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT A NAKED PLAIN COVERED OVER WITH THE BONES OF THOSE WHO HAD COME THAT WAY BEFORE SEEKING THE FRUIT WHICH THE TRAVELLING SERVANT HAD SOUGHT IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THE SERVANT FOUND HIS WAY BACK INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
AN ANGEL CAME AND SHOWED THE WAY TO MY SON
BUT TO BRING AN APPLE FOR ME ALSO THEN THE POOR TRAVELLING SERVANT BEGAN TO THUMP HIS HEAD HE SAW WELL ENOUGH THROUGH THE MILLSTONE NOW AND THAT HE TOO MIGHT HAVE HAD ONE OF THE FRUIT IF HE HAD BUT HELD HIS TONGUE A LITTLE LONGER
FOR MANY A LONG DAY AND NEVER KNEW THAT A GREAT TREASURE OF SILVER AND GOLD WAS HIDDEN BENEATH IT UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO THERE CAME AN ANGEL
THE NEXT MORNING THE POOR SERVANT JOGGED ALONG ON HIS HOMEWARD WAY MORE SAD AND DOWNCAST THAN EVER AND BY EVENING HE HAD COME TO THE ROBBERS DEN IN THE THICK WOODS AND THERE THE OLD WOMAN CAME RUNNING TO THE DOOR TO MEET HIM
AND THE NEXT DAY CAME TO THE TOWN AND TO THE HOUSE OF THE SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN THERE LO AND BEHOLD INSTEAD OF BEING DARK AND SILENT AS IT WAS BEFORE ALL WAS ABLAZE WITH LIGHT AND NOISY WITH THE SOUND OF REJOICING AND MERRIMENT
THERE HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD STANDING AT THE DOOR AND HE KNEW THE SERVANT AS THE COMPANION OF THAT ONE WHO HAD STOLEN THE RUBY RING UP HE CAME AND LAID HOLD OF THE SERVANT BY THE COLLAR CALLING TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT ONE OF THE THIEVES
MY WIFE AND ALL MY FRIENDS FELL OUT WITH ME AND WE QUARRELLED SO THAT THEY ALL LEFT ME BUT THOUGH I KNEW IT NOT AT THAT TIME YOUR COMRADE WAS AN ANGEL AND TOOK THE RING AWAY WITH HIM AND NOW I AM AS HAPPY AS I WAS SORROWFUL BEFORE
AND THEN JOGGED ALL THE WAY BACK HOME AGAIN TO COOK CABBAGE AND ONIONS AND POT HERBS AND TO MAKE BROTH FOR WISER MEN THAN HIMSELF TO SUP
I WOULD AS LIEF AS NOT I LIKED THE STORY WELL ENOUGH PIPED UP THE LITTLE TAILOR WHO HAD KILLED SEVEN FLIES AT A BLOW TWAS A GOOD ENOUGH STORY OF ITS SORT BUT WHY DOES NOBODY TELL A TALE OF GOOD BIG GIANTS AND OF WILD BOARS AND OF UNICORNS
HENCE THE DRIVER'S HOPE OF FINDING THEM IN THE RUE DE BOURGOGNE
AND WHICH WAS IT THAT SAID THEE AND THOU
SHE WITH SHABBY DRESS AND SHOES AS BIG AS A GOUTY MAN'S YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER SHAKE THE PRIM LOOKING GIRL AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A PLUM TREE YOU LITTLE FOOL SAID SHE DO YOU WANT TO RUIN US
CONTRARY TO LECOQ'S ORIGINAL IDEA IT NOW SEEMED EVIDENT THAT SHE WAS THE MISTRESS AND HER COMPANION THE SERVANT IS THAT ALL MY GOOD FELLOW HE ASKED THE DRIVER
BUT SHE CERTAINLY WAS A BLONDE AND WITH PLENTY OF HAIR TOO WAS SHE TALL OR SHORT STOUT OR SLENDER BETWEEN THE TWO THIS WAS VERY VAGUE AND THE OTHER
OVERTOOK ME AND PASSED ON ONE OF THEM DROPPED THIS HANDKERCHIEF WHICH I PICKED UP I HASTENED AFTER HER TO RESTORE IT BUT BEFORE I COULD OVERTAKE THEM THEY HAD RUNG THE BELL AT YOUR DOOR AND WERE ALREADY IN THE HOUSE
THE ATTENDANTS ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO THE HORRORS OF THE PLACE THAT THE MOST SICKLY SIGHT FAILS TO IMPRESS THEM AND EVEN UNDER THE MOST DISTRESSING CIRCUMSTANCES THEY HASTEN GAILY TO AND FRO
I PREFER TO ALIGHT HERE RATHER THAN IN FRONT OF THE MORGUE HE SAID SPRINGING TO THE GROUND THEN PRODUCING FIRST HIS WATCH AND NEXT HIS PURSE HE ADDED
WHICH CRIME ACCIDENT AND SUICIDE BRING TO THIS HORRIBLE PLACE A FEW
MAY COME NO FURTHER THAN THE DOOR BUT THE OTHERS ENTER AND AFTER A LONG STARE RETURN AND RECOUNT THEIR IMPRESSIONS TO THEIR LESS COURAGEOUS COMPANIONS IF THERE SHOULD BE NO CORPSE EXHIBITED
HIS COMRADES PUT THEIR HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH AND ONE OF THEM EXCLAIMED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT YOU FOOL TO MIX YOURSELF UP WITH THIS AFFAIR DO YOU WANT TO GET US INTO TROUBLE THEREUPON THEY WENT OUT AND I FOLLOWED THEM
IN THE MEAN TIME WATCHING THEM OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SEND THIS NOTE EXPLAINING MY ABSENCE TO THE HEAD KEEPER WHO WILL GIVE IT YOU YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I AM GOING TO FOLLOW THESE MEN A B
WHEN FINDING A DOORKEEPER INSTALLED BEHIND A HEAVY OAKEN DESK HE REMARKED
WAS HE NOT BRINGING WITH HIM THE MOST POTENT OF JUSTIFICATIONS HE THOUGHT OF THE AGREEABLE SURPRISE HE HAD IN STORE FOR THE MAGISTRATE AND FANCIED HE COULD PICTURE THE SUDDEN BRIGHTENING OF THAT FUNCTIONARY'S GLOOMY FACE
AND YET FATE SO WILLED IT THAT THE DOORKEEPER'S MESSAGE AND HIS URGENT APPEAL THAT LECOQ SHOULD NOT LOITER ON THE WAY PRODUCED THE MOST UNFORTUNATE RESULTS
WHEN HE SAW HOWEVER THAT THE MAGISTRATE WAS NOT ALONE AND WHEN HE RECOGNIZED POLYTE CHUPIN THE ORIGINAL OF THE PHOTOGRAPH
AT THE SAME TIME CASTING THE BLAME ON HIS OWN IMPATIENCE AND LACK OF CAUTION
DON'T PREVARICATE ANY LONGER HE SAID YOU CERTAINLY ORDERED YOUR WIFE NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LACHENEUR THAT'S EVIDENT WHY DID YOU DO SO WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF HER TELLING US
AS THESE WORDS FELL ON POLYTE'S EARS IT WAS EVIDENT HIS IMPUDENCE AND INDIFFERENCE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE SHOCK HE SEEMED CONFOUNDED AND HUNG HIS HEAD AS IF THOROUGHLY ABASHED STILL HE PRESERVED AN OBSTINATE SILENCE
IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HER TO SPEAK SHE LOVES THAT RASCAL INTENSELY AND HE HAS A WONDERFUL INFLUENCE OVER HER YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID HE THREATENED HER WITH DEATH IF SHE BREATHED A WORD ABOUT LACHENEUR
SHE DISCOURSED ON LOCKE SHE WAS POLITE SHE WAS SUSPECTED OF KNOWING ARABIC TO BE THE FLESH AND TO BE WOMAN ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
IF SHE HAD STABBED HERSELF IT WOULD LIKE LUCRETIA NOT HAVE BEEN UNTIL AFTERWARDS SHE WAS A VIRGIN STAINED WITH EVERY DEFILEMENT IN ITS VISIONARY STAGE SHE WAS A POSSIBLE ASTARTE IN A REAL DIANA SHE WAS IN THE INSOLENCE OF HIGH BIRTH
JOSIANA BROUGHT TO ONE'S MIND THE LINE
COLLARED HATTON BOXED THE EARS OF ESSEX SHOWED HER LEGS TO BASSOMPIERRE AND WAS A VIRGIN
JUNO RESOLVES HERSELF INTO ARAMINTA A PRETENSION TO DIVINITY NOT ADMITTED CREATES AFFECTATION IN DEFAULT OF THUNDERCLAPS THERE IS IMPERTINENCE THE TEMPLE SHRIVELS INTO THE BOUDOIR NOT HAVING THE POWER TO BE A GODDESS SHE IS AN IDOL
AND HER WEAKNESS BY HER OMNIPOTENCE HAS SHE CLAIMED ABSOLUTION MORE IMPERIOUSLY IN MAKING THE FORBIDDEN THE PERMITTED FRUIT EVE FELL IN MAKING THE PERMITTED THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT SHE TRIUMPHS THAT IS THE CLIMAX
IT IS UNBECOMING TO BE MARRIED FADES ONE'S RIBBONS AND MAKES ONE LOOK OLD AN ESPOUSAL IS A DREARY ABSORPTION OF BRILLIANCY A WOMAN HANDED OVER TO YOU BY A NOTARY HOW COMMONPLACE
NIGHT AND DAY WERE MINGLED IN HER LOOK HER AMBITION WAS THIS TO SHOW HERSELF CAPABLE OF IMPOSSIBILITIES ONE DAY SHE SAID TO SWIFT YOU PEOPLE FANCY THAT YOU KNOW WHAT SCORN IS YOU PEOPLE MEANT THE HUMAN RACE
SHE WORE GREAT DRESSES OF VELVET SATIN OR MOIRE SOME COMPOSED OF FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YARDS OF MATERIAL WITH EMBROIDERIES OF GOLD AND SILVER AND ROUND HER WAIST MANY KNOTS OF PEARLS ALTERNATING WITH OTHER PRECIOUS STONES SHE WAS EXTRAVAGANT IN GOLD LACE
HE HELD HIS GROUND PRINCE DEVEREUX WAS THE FIRST LORD DAVID DIRRY MOIR THE SECOND IT IS SOMETIMES MORE DIFFICULT TO BE SECOND THAN FIRST IT REQUIRES LESS GENIUS BUT MORE COURAGE THE FIRST INTOXICATED BY THE NOVELTY MAY IGNORE THE DANGER
MEN FOUND SUFFICIENT AUDACITY TO WEAR THEIR OWN HAIR AND POWDER WAS INTRODUCED AS AN EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH BEFORE WE PASS ON AN IMPORTANT PERIOD OF HISTORY WE SHOULD REMARK THAT THE FIRST BLOW IN THE WAR OF WIGS WAS REALLY STRUCK BY A QUEEN
COCLES BEING BLIND OF THE LEFT CAMOENS OF THE RIGHT EYE SO ARRANGED THAT THE TWO PROFILES WITHOUT EYES WERE TURNED TO EACH OTHER THE DAY THAT THE BEAUTIFUL MISSUS VISART CAUGHT THE SMALL POX THE UGLY CLUB TOASTED HER THIS CLUB WAS STILL IN EXISTENCE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
AND MIRABEAU WAS ELECTED AN HONORARY MEMBER
HAD TURNED AND DANCED ABOUT ENOUGH THEY ORDERED THEIR SERVANTS TO BEAT HIM WITH STICKS TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF HIS IDEAS OTHERS HIT THE LION THAT IS THEY GAILY STOPPED A PASSENGER
LORD DAVID WAS ONE OF THE FEW REFEREES WHOM THEY DARED NOT THRASH NO ONE COULD TRAIN LIKE HIM THE PUGILIST WHOSE TRAINER HE CONSENTED TO BECOME WAS SURE TO WIN LORD DAVID WOULD CHOOSE A HERCULES MASSIVE AS A ROCK TALL AS A TOWER AND MAKE HIM HIS CHILD
IT WAS HE WHO INVENTED THE ATHLETE'S ADMIRABLE RULES
AS A CHRISTIAN SHE WAS A HERETIC AND A BIGOT SHE HAD ONE BEAUTY
THE REST OF HER PERSON WAS INDIFFERENTLY FORMED SHE WAS A CLUMSY COQUETTE AND A CHASTE ONE HER SKIN WAS WHITE AND FINE SHE DISPLAYED A GREAT DEAL OF IT IT WAS SHE WHO INTRODUCED THE FASHION OF NECKLACES OF LARGE PEARLS CLASPED ROUND THE THROAT
GOOD NATURED HER IDEAL WAS TO ALLOW NONE TO DESPAIR AND TO WORRY ALL SHE HAD OFTEN A ROUGH WORD IN HER MOUTH
THOSE FIT FOR SERVICE WERE PICKED OUT
IN SIXTEEN NINETY FIVE THERE WERE THIRTY OF THESE OVENS IN PARIS THE LAWS AGAINST IRELAND EMANATING FROM QUEEN ANNE WERE ATROCIOUS ANNE WAS BORN IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE GREAT FIRE OF LONDON ON WHICH THE ASTROLOGERS THERE WERE SOME LEFT
THREE ONE IDIOTIC HABIT OF THE PEOPLE IS TO ATTRIBUTE TO THE KING WHAT THEY DO THEMSELVES THEY FIGHT WHOSE THE GLORY THE KING'S THEY PAY WHOSE THE GENEROSITY THE KING'S THEN THE PEOPLE LOVE HIM FOR BEING SO RICH
THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE RESERVED FOR KINGS ALONE IS AN EXCELLENT FIGURE OF ROYALTY THE HORSE IS THE PEOPLE ONLY THAT THE HORSE BECOMES TRANSFIGURED BY DEGREES IT BEGINS IN AN ASS IT ENDS IN A LION
COUNTED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN HER FLEET THE ENGLISH HAD THREE ARMIES FIVE THOUSAND MEN IN CATALONIA TEN THOUSAND IN PORTUGAL FIFTY THOUSAND IN FLANDERS
WHAT GREAT THINGS ACCOMPLISHED HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO REFUSE ANNE ADMIRATION FOR TAKING THE TROUBLE OF LIVING AT THE PERIOD
NOT FROM CHOICE HOWEVER A PART OF HER RELIGION SHE DERIVED FROM THAT UGLINESS
WAS A CAUSE OF VEXATION TO THE QUEEN TO AN UGLY QUEEN A PRETTY DUCHESS IS NOT AN AGREEABLE SISTER THERE WAS ANOTHER GRIEVANCE JOSIANA'S IMPROPER BIRTH ANNE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF ANNE HYDE A SIMPLE GENTLEWOMAN LEGITIMATELY
THOU HAST PUT ALL THINGS UNDER HIS FEET SAYS THE PSALMIST GOD ACCOMPANIED THIS GIFT WITH THESE WORDS ADDRESSED TO OUR FIRST PARENTS AFTER THE CREATION BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY
WHOEVER VIOLATED IT WAS UNJUST THUS LABOR GIVES BIRTH TO PRIVATE POSSESSION THE RIGHT IN A THING
AND THAT THIS METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION FIXED AND DURABLE IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO PRODUCTION BUT HOW COULD THIS DIVISION GIVE TO EACH A TRANSFERABLE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A THING TO WHICH
AND THE MUTUAL CONCESSIONS OF THOSE WHO SHARE THE LAND ARE NOTHING LESS THAN TRAFFIC IN NATURAL RIGHTS THE ORIGINAL CULTIVATORS OF THE LAND WHO WERE ALSO THE ORIGINAL MAKERS OF THE LAW WERE NOT AS LEARNED
DOMINIUM NON POTEST NISI EX UNA CAUSA
SOME PHILOSOPHERS PRETEND THAT MAN IN EMPLOYING HIS FORCES UPON A NATURAL OBJECT SAY A FIELD OR A TREE ACQUIRES A RIGHT ONLY TO THE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH HE MAKES
THE LAW MAKERS ALWAYS DISREGARD THE LATTER AS LONG AS MAN IS OPPOSED TO MAN PROPERTY OFFSETS PROPERTY AND THE TWO FORCES BALANCE EACH OTHER AS SOON AS MAN IS ISOLATED
THE CIVIL STATE WAS NEEDED THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN RACE HAD RENDERED AGRICULTURE NECESSARY THE NEED OF SECURING TO THE CULTIVATOR THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR MADE PERMANENT PROPERTY NECESSARY
BLIND LAW THE LAW OF THE IGNORANT MAN A LAW WHICH IS NOT A LAW THE VOICE OF DISCORD DECEIT AND BLOOD THIS IT IS WHICH CONTINUALLY REVIVED REINSTATED REJUVENATED
WHO NEVER HAD THE FAINTEST IDEA OF STATISTICS VALUATION OR POLITICAL ECONOMY FURNISH US WITH PRINCIPLES OF LEGISLATION THE LAW SAYS A MODERN WRITER ON JURISPRUDENCE
IT CARRIES WITH IT THE RIGHT TO LET TO LEASE TO LOAN AT INTEREST TO PROFIT BY EXCHANGE TO SETTLE ANNUITIES AND TO LEVY A TAX ON A FIELD WHICH INTENT RESERVES
FAMILIES WILL SOON BECOME VICTIMS OF THE MOST DISASTROUS EXCLUSIONS AND SOCIETY
RESTING OF NECESSITY UPON EQUALITY CONTRADICTS ITS PRINCIPLE THE DECISION OF THE RELIGIONS WHICH HAVE SANCTIONED IT IS OF NO EFFECT BECAUSE IN ALL AGES THE PRIEST HAS SUBMITTED TO THE PRINCE
THIS NO CODE HAS EVER EXPRESSED THIS NO CONSTITUTION CAN ADMIT THESE ARE AXIOMS WHICH THE CIVIL LAW AND THE LAW OF NATIONS DENY
A BURDEN MAKES A ROUGH ROAD ROUGHER IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN FOUR HOURS SINCE THE HOOKER HAD SAILED FROM THE CREEK OF PORTLAND LEAVING THE BOY ON THE SHORE
FROM TIME TO TIME STILL HOLDING HER SECURELY HE BENT DOWN AND TAKING A HANDFUL OF SNOW HE RUBBED HIS FEET WITH IT TO PREVENT THEIR BEING FROST BITTEN
FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD CEASED TO SEE THE SMOKE SUCH INDICATIONS ARE SOON EFFACED IN THE NIGHT BESIDES IT WAS PAST THE HOUR WHEN FIRES ARE PUT OUT OR HE HAD PERHAPS MADE A MISTAKE
SHE ENDED BY FALLING INTO A SOUND SLEEP SHIVERING HIMSELF HE FELT HER WARM
SHE OCCUPIED BOTH HIS ARMS AND TO HIM WHO WALKS OVER ICE BOTH ARMS ARE A NATURAL AND NECESSARY BALANCING POWER HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO WITHOUT THIS BALANCE HE DID WITHOUT IT AND ADVANCED
THE WATCH OF A SHIP WHICH HAS WANDERED FROM HER COURSE FEELS SOME SUCH EMOTION WHEN HE CRIES LAND HO HE HURRIED HIS STEPS AT LENGTH THEN HE WAS NEAR MANKIND
HE ALMOST RAN HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON THE ROOFS THERE WAS LIFE THERE HE NEVER TOOK HIS EYES OFF THEM A DEAD MAN MIGHT GAZE THUS ON WHAT MIGHT APPEAR THROUGH THE HALF OPENED LID OF HIS SEPULCHRE
THE DESERTED CHILD CARRYING THE FOUNDLING PASSED THROUGH THE FIRST STREET THEN THE SECOND THEN THE THIRD
BUT ALL WERE CLOSED AND DARK AT INTERVALS HE KNOCKED AT THE DOORS NO ONE ANSWERED NOTHING MAKES THE HEART SO LIKE A STONE AS BEING WARM BETWEEN SHEETS THE NOISE AND THE SHAKING HAD AT LENGTH AWAKENED THE INFANT
HE HAD NO STRENGTH LEFT TO CALL OR SHOUT AT MELCOMBE REGIS AS AT WEYMOUTH NO ONE WAS STIRRING THE DOORS WERE ALL CAREFULLY DOUBLE LOCKED THE WINDOWS WERE COVERED BY THEIR SHUTTERS AS THE EYES BY THEIR LIDS
ALL ITS LETHARGIES MINGLE THEIR NIGHTMARES ITS SLUMBERS ARE A CROWD AND FROM ITS HUMAN BODIES LYING PRONE THERE ARISES A VAPOUR OF DREAMS SLEEP HAS GLOOMY ASSOCIATES BEYOND THIS LIFE
WHICH HE TOOK FOR THE OCEAN HE NO LONGER KNEW IN WHAT DIRECTION THE SEA LAY HE RETRACED HIS STEPS STRUCK TO THE LEFT BY MAIDEN STREET AND RETURNED AS FAR AS SAINT ALBAN'S ROW
THEY WERE JUST OVER A SOMEWHAT SEVERE OUTBREAK OF THE PLAGUE IN LONDON AND THAT THE FEAR OF RECEIVING SICK VAGABONDS CAUSED A DIMINUTION OF HOSPITALITY EVERYWHERE PEOPLE WOULD NOT EVEN OPEN THEIR WINDOWS FOR FEAR OF INHALING THE POISON
NOTHING IS SO FREEZING IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS AS THE VOICE OF THE HOUR IT IS A DECLARATION OF INDIFFERENCE IT IS ETERNITY SAYING WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME HE STOPPED
SHOULD HE CONTINUE THIS JOURNEY SHOULD HE ADVANCE AND RE ENTER THE SOLITUDES SHOULD HE RETURN AND RE ENTER THE STREETS WHAT WAS HE TO DO BETWEEN THOSE TWO SILENCES THE MUTE PLAIN AND THE DEAF CITY
THE MOUTH WAS SILENT THE HEAD BEGAN AGAIN IS ANY ONE THERE THE CHILD ANSWERED YES WHO I YOU WHO ARE YOU WHENCE DO YOU COME
ON THE STOVE WERE SMOKING A PORRINGER AND A SAUCEPAN CONTAINING TO ALL APPEARANCE SOMETHING TO EAT THE SAVOURY ODOUR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE HUT WAS FURNISHED WITH A CHEST
REACHED THE ROOF THE MAN COULD NOT HAVE RAISED HIMSELF ON TIPTOE THE CARAVAN WAS JUST HIS SIZE COME IN SAID THE MAN WHO WAS URSUS THE CHILD ENTERED PUT DOWN YOUR BUNDLE
THE MAN TOOK FROM THE SHELF A CRUST OF HARD BREAD AND AN IRON FORK AND HANDED THEM TO THE CHILD THE BOY HESITATED PERHAPS YOU EXPECT ME TO LAY THE CLOTH SAID THE MAN AND HE PLACED THE PORRINGER ON THE CHILD'S LAP
THIS WAS INDEED THE EGYPT OF THE CONFEDERACY THE RICH GRANARY WHENCE POTATOES AND CORN AND COTTON POURED OUT TO THE FAMISHED AND RAGGED CONFEDERATE TROOPS AS THEY BATTLED FOR A CAUSE LOST LONG BEFORE EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
SHELTERED AND SECURE IT BECAME THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR FAMILIES WEALTH AND SLAVES YET EVEN THEN THE HARD RUTHLESS RAPE OF THE LAND BEGAN TO TELL THE RED CLAY SUB SOIL ALREADY HAD BEGUN TO PEER ABOVE THE LOAM
THE SOLEMN PINES HAVE DISAPPEARED AND THIS IS THE OAKEY WOODS WITH ITS WEALTH OF HICKORIES BEECHES OAKS AND PALMETTOS BUT A PALL OF DEBT HANGS OVER THE BEAUTIFUL LAND THE MERCHANTS ARE IN DEBT TO THE WHOLESALERS
WE PASSED ONE FENCED STOCK FARM WITH GRASS AND GRAZING CATTLE THAT LOOKED VERY HOME LIKE AFTER ENDLESS CORN AND COTTON HERE AND THERE ARE BLACK FREE HOLDERS THERE IS THE GAUNT DULL BLACK JACKSON WITH HIS HUNDRED ACRES
EVEN THEN HOWEVER THE FIELDS AS WE PROCEED BEGIN TO REDDEN AND THE TREES DISAPPEAR ROWS OF OLD CABINS APPEAR FILLED WITH RENTERS AND LABORERS CHEERLESS BARE AND DIRTY FOR THE MOST PART ALTHOUGH HERE AND THERE
SO HE MOVED HERE WHERE THE RENT IS HIGHER THE LAND POORER AND THE OWNER INFLEXIBLE HE RENTS A FORTY DOLLAR MULE FOR TWENTY DOLLARS A YEAR POOR LAD A SLAVE AT TWENTY TWO THIS PLANTATION OWNED NOW BY A FOREIGNER
TWENTY YEARS YONDER SUNKEN CHEEKED OLD BLACK MAN HAS LABORED UNDER THAT SYSTEM AND NOW TURNED DAY LABORER IS SUPPORTING HIS WIFE AND BOARDING HIMSELF ON HIS WAGES OF A DOLLAR AND A HALF A WEEK RECEIVED ONLY PART OF THE YEAR
THE BOLTON CONVICT FARM FORMERLY INCLUDED THE NEIGHBORING PLANTATION HERE IT WAS THAT THE CONVICTS WERE LODGED IN THE GREAT LOG PRISON STILL STANDING A DISMAL PLACE IT STILL REMAINS WITH ROWS OF UGLY HUTS
THERE IS LITTLE OF THE JOYOUS ABANDON AND PLAYFULNESS WHICH WE ARE WONT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE PLANTATION NEGRO AT BEST THE NATURAL GOOD NATURE IS EDGED WITH COMPLAINT OR HAS CHANGED INTO SULLENNESS AND GLOOM
AND STILL HAVING NOTHING TO BE SURE HE HAD GIVEN FOUR CHILDREN A COMMON SCHOOL TRAINING AND PERHAPS IF THE NEW FENCE LAW HAD NOT ALLOWED UNFENCED CROPS IN WEST DOUGHERTY HE MIGHT HAVE RAISED A LITTLE STOCK AND KEPT AHEAD
WITH AN IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY THAT SEEMED ALMOST SUSPICIOUS THEN HE CONTINUED MY MULE DIED LAST WEEK A CALAMITY IN THIS LAND EQUAL TO A DEVASTATING FIRE IN TOWN
BUT A WHITE MAN LOANED ME ANOTHER THEN HE ADDED EYEING US
THAT THE CONCERN SOON LANDED IN INEXTRICABLE BANKRUPTCY NOBODY LIVES IN THE OLD HOUSE NOW BUT A MAN COMES EACH WINTER OUT OF THE NORTH AND COLLECTS HIS HIGH RENTS I KNOW NOT WHICH ARE THE MORE TOUCHING SUCH OLD EMPTY HOUSES
AND THERE WERE FENCES AND MEADOWS HERE AND THERE MOST OF THIS LAND WAS POOR AND BENEATH THE NOTICE OF THE SLAVE BARON BEFORE THE WAR SINCE THEN HIS POOR RELATIONS AND FOREIGN IMMIGRANTS HAVE SEIZED IT
THE RETURNS OF THE FARMER ARE TOO SMALL TO ALLOW MUCH FOR WAGES AND YET HE WILL NOT SELL OFF SMALL FARMS THERE IS THE NEGRO SANFORD HE HAS WORKED FOURTEEN YEARS AS OVERSEER ON THE LADSON PLACE AND
BUT THE OWNER WILL NOT SELL OFF A FEW ACRES TWO CHILDREN A BOY AND A GIRL ARE HOEING STURDILY IN THE FIELDS ON THE FARM WHERE CORLISS WORKS HE IS SMOOTH FACED AND BROWN AND IS FENCING UP HIS PIGS
THEN THE CHARACTER OF THE FARMS BEGINS TO CHANGE
THE OVERSEERS ARE WHITE AND THE CABINS ARE BARE BOARD HOUSES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE THE RENTS ARE HIGH AND DAY LABORERS AND CONTRACT HANDS ABOUND IT IS A KEEN HARD STRUGGLE FOR LIVING HERE
AND FEW HAVE TIME TO TALK TIRED WITH THE LONG RIDE WE GLADLY DRIVE INTO GILLONSVILLE IT IS A SILENT CLUSTER OF FARMHOUSES STANDING ON THE CROSSROADS WITH ONE OF ITS STORES CLOSED AND THE OTHER KEPT BY A NEGRO PREACHER
THOU HAST FORGOTTEN O SUMMER SWALLOW BUT THE WORLD SHALL END WHEN I FORGET SWINBURNE
I HANDLE IT CURIOUSLY AND WATCH PERPLEXED ITS WINKING BREATHING AND SNEEZING I DID NOT LOVE IT THEN IT SEEMED A LUDICROUS THING TO LOVE BUT HER I LOVED
SHOWED HIM THE STAR CHILDREN AND THE TWINKLING LIGHTS AS THEY BEGAN TO FLASH AND STILLED WITH AN EVEN SONG THE UNVOICED TERROR OF MY LIFE SO STURDY AND MASTERFUL HE GREW SO FILLED WITH BUBBLING LIFE
AND THEN HIS LITTLE SOUL LEAPT LIKE A STAR THAT TRAVELS IN THE NIGHT AND LEFT A WORLD OF DARKNESS IN ITS TRAIN THE DAY CHANGED NOT
THE SAME TALL TREES PEEPED IN AT THE WINDOWS THE SAME GREEN GRASS GLINTED IN THE SETTING SUN ONLY IN THE CHAMBER OF DEATH WRITHED THE WORLD'S MOST PITEOUS THING A CHILDLESS MOTHER
IS NOT THIS MY LIFE HARD ENOUGH IS NOT THAT DULL LAND THAT STRETCHES ITS SNEERING WEB ABOUT ME COLD ENOUGH IS NOT ALL THE WORLD BEYOND THESE FOUR LITTLE WALLS PITILESS ENOUGH BUT THAT THOU MUST NEEDS ENTER HERE THOU O DEATH
HE KNEW NO COLOR LINE POOR DEAR AND THE VEIL THOUGH IT SHADOWED HIM HAD NOT YET DARKENED HALF HIS SUN HE LOVED THE WHITE MATRON HE LOVED HIS BLACK NURSE
SHE WHO IN SIMPLE CLEARNESS OF VISION SEES BEYOND THE STARS SAID WHEN HE HAD FLOWN HE WILL BE HAPPY THERE HE EVER LOVED BEAUTIFUL THINGS
ALL THAT DAY AND ALL THAT NIGHT THERE SAT AN AWFUL GLADNESS IN MY HEART NAY BLAME ME NOT IF I SEE THE WORLD THUS DARKLY THROUGH THE VEIL AND MY SOUL WHISPERS EVER TO ME SAYING NOT DEAD
SURELY THERE SHALL YET DAWN SOME MIGHTY MORNING TO LIFT THE VEIL AND SET THE PRISONED FREE NOT FOR ME I SHALL DIE IN MY BONDS BUT FOR FRESH YOUNG SOULS WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN THE NIGHT
WHEN I ENTERED THE HOUSE AND SAW MOTHER IN HER OLD PLACE HER SURROUNDINGS UNALTERED I SUFFERED A DISAPPOINTMENT I HAD NOT HAD THE POWER OF TRANSFERRING THE ATMOSPHERE OF MY YEAR'S MISERY TO SURREY
INQUIRED MOTHER HE IS GETTING HIS DOUBLE TEETH OH YES AND WHERE'S VERONICA SHE'S UP GARRET WRITING GEOGRAPHY AND TOLD ME NOTHING IN THE WORLD MUST DISTURB HER TILL SHE HAD FINISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE CITY OF PALMIRY
A TORRENT OF LOVE SWEPT THROUGH ME AND I KISSED HIM I AM AFRAID I MAKE AN IDOL OF HIM CASSY ARE YOU UNHAPPY BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM SO WELL MOTHER AND FEEL THAT YOU MUST MAKE EXPIATION CASSANDRA SHE SPOKE WITH HASTE
MY HEARING HIM OR NOT WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE SINCE GOD COULD HEAR AND ANSWER GRAND'THER DOES NOT LIKE ME I NEVER PLEASED HIM SHE LOOKED ASTONISHED THEN REFLECTIVE
AND ATE IT IN SILENCE THE PLENTY AROUND ME THE EASE AND INDEPENDENCE GAVE ME A DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF COMFORT THE DISHES WERE ODD SOME OF CHINA SOME OF DELF AND WERE CONTINUALLY MOVED OUT OF THEIR PLACES FOR WE HELPED OURSELVES
I FEEL EVIL STILL YOU KNOW TURNING TO ME THAT MY TEMPER IS WORSE THAN EVER IT IS LIKE A TIGER'S OH VERRY SAID MOTHER NOT QUITE SO BAD YOU ARE TOO HARD UPON YOURSELF
AND DARTING OUT A MOMENT AFTER WE HEARD HER GRANDFATHER WENT AND PRESENTLY MISTER PARK GOT UP IN A LINGERING WAY
AS I PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER ENTRY VERONICA OPENED HER DOOR SHE WAS UNDRESSED AND HAD A LITTLE BOOK IN HER HAND WHICH SHE SHOOK AT ME SAYING
AND PEAKED ROOF AND ON THE SIDE TOWARD US A LARGE YARD AND STABLES WE DROVE INTO THE YARD AND A WOMAN CAME OUT ON THE PIAZZA TO RECEIVE US IT WAS MISSUS MORGESON OR MY WIFE COUSIN ALICE
AS MISTER MORGESON INTRODUCED HER GIVING US A CORDIAL WELCOME SHE LED US INTO A PARLOR WHERE TEA WAS WAITING A SERVANT CAME IN FOR OUR BONNETS AND BASKETS COUSIN ALICE BEGGED US TO TAKE TEA AT ONCE
WE WERE HARDLY SEATED WHEN WE HEARD THE CRY OF A YOUNG CHILD SHE LEFT THE TABLE HASTILY TO COME BACK IN A MOMENT WITH AN APOLOGY WHICH SHE MADE TO COUSIN CHARLES RATHER THAN TO US I HAD NEVER SEEN A TABLE SO WELL ARRANGED
THE LAMB CHOPS WERE FRAGILE THE BREAD WAS DELICIOUS BUT CUT IN TRANSPARENT SLICES AND THE BUTTER PAT WAS NEARLY STAMPED THROUGH WITH ITS BOUQUET OF FLOWERS THIS WAS ALL THE FEAST EXCEPT SPONGE CAKE WHICH FELT LIKE MUSLIN IN THE FINGERS
THE FURNITURE WAS DARK THE MANTEL AND TABLE TOPS WERE BLACK MARBLE AND THE VASES AND CANDELABRA WERE BRONZE HE DIRECTED MOTHER'S ATTENTION TO THE PORTRAITS OF HIS CHILDREN EXPLAINING THEM
I THINK THEY WOULD GRUMBLE AND ADMIRE LOOK AT THIS SHOWING HER THE TASSELS OF THE INNER WINDOW CURTAINS DONE UP IN LITTLE BAGS AND THE GLASS IS PINNED UP WITH NICE YELLOW PAPER
WHICH WAS NOT THE ONE WE HAD TAKEN TEA IN BUT A SMALL APARTMENT WITH A DOOR OPENING INTO THE GARDEN
I SAID MOTHER TRIED IN VAIN TO LOOK HARD HEARTED AND TO PERSUADE THAT IT WAS GOOD FOR ME BUT SHE LOST HER APPETITE WITH THE THOUGHT OF LOSING ME WHICH THE MENTION OF DOCTOR PRICE BROUGHT HOME
COUSIN ALICE GAVE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO EDWARD WHO ATE AS LITTLE AS THE REST MOTHER I SAID AFTERWARD
I NOTICED HOW ELEGANT THEIR TABLE APPOINTMENTS WERE AND I SHALL BUY NEW CHINA IN BOSTON TO MORROW I WISH HEPSEY WOULD NOT LOAD OUR TABLE AS SHE DOES HEPSEY IS A GOOD WOMAN MOTHER DO GIVE MY LOVE TO HER NOW THAT I THINK OF IT
SHE SAID SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO THEY LOOKED UNGOVERNABLE BUT HE REASSURED HER AND ONE OF THE MEN AVERRING THAT MISTER MORGESON COULD DRIVE ANYTHING SHE REPRESSED HER FEARS AND WE DROVE OUT OF THE YARD BEHIND A PAIR OF HORSES
TELLING HIM IT WAS THE LIKENESS OF HER COUSIN RACHEL'S HUSBAND I REPLIED WE KNEW THAT GRANDFATHER HAD MARRIED A RACHEL SOMERS COUSIN CHARLES WAS SURPRISED AND A LITTLE VEXED THAT THE DOCTOR HAD NEVER TOLD HIM
FOR MEALS WERE PREPARED AT ALL HOURS FOR COMERS AND GOERS TEMPERANCE TOLD ME THAT THE MILD AND INDIFFERENT MOURNERS WERE FOND OF GOOD VICTUALS AND SHE THOUGHT THEIR HEARTS WERE LIGHTER THAN THEIR STOMACHS WHEN THEY WENT AWAY
FOR SHE DERIVED A SIMPLE COMFORT FROM THESE EXTERNAL TOKENS VERONICA REFUSED TO WEAR THE BONNET AND VEIL AND THE REQUIRED BOMBAZINE BOMBAZINE MADE HER FLESH CRAWL WHY SHOULD SHE WEAR IT MOTHER HATED IT TOO
FOR SHE HAD NEVER WORN OUT THE GARMENTS MADE FOR GRAND'THER WARREN SHE'S A BIGGER CHILD THAN EVER TEMPERANCE REMARKED AND MUST HAVE HER WAY
IS THIS LIKE HER SHE ASKED SHOWING ME A DRAWING HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE I HAVE TRIED IS IT LIKE YES THE IDEA
IT WAS CLOSELY PRESSED TO THE GLASS AND SHE WAS REGARDING DARK INDEFINITE CREATURES BELOW IT
THE LANDING STAIR WAS FULL OF PEOPLE I LOCKED THE DOOR AND TOOK OUT THE KEY THE STAIRS WERE CROWDED ALL MADE WAY FOR ME WITH A SILENT RESPECT AUNT MERCE WHEN SHE SAW ME
AND ANXIOUS TO ESCAPE THE UNPROFITABLE TRIAL AS THE COFFIN WAS TAKEN OUT TO THE HEARSE MY HEART TWISTED AND PALPITATED AS IF A COMMAND HAD BEEN LAID UPON IT TO FOLLOW AND NOT LEAVE HER
AT LAST THE WORD WAS GIVEN AND THE LONG PROCESSION BEGAN TO MOVE THROUGH THE STREET WHICH WAS DESERTED A CAT RAN OUT OF A HOUSE AND SCAMPERED ACROSS THE WAY ARTHUR LAUGHED AND FATHER JUMPED NERVOUSLY AT THE SOUND OF HIS LAUGH
OR OUR INDIFFERENCE WAS SETTLED WE COULD TAKE OFF OUR MOURNING GARMENTS AND OUR MOURNING COUNTENANCE NOW THAT WE WERE ALONE OR WE COULD GIVE WAY TO THAT ANGUISH WE ARE AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO SHOW EXCEPT BEFORE THE ONE
THE FIRS HAD BEEN LITTLE MORE THAN VIGOROUS YOUNG SAPLINGS THEY WERE TALL GNARLED TREES NOW WITH LICHENED TRUNKS AND THEIR LOWER BOUGHS WERE DEAD BUT HIGH UP THEIR TOPS WERE GREEN AND CAUGHT THE SAFFRON LIGHT OF THE WEST
PITILESS UNSWERVING EAGLE EYES QUICK TO DISCERN AND UNFALTERING TO PURSUE JAW SQUARE AND INTREPID MOUTH FORMED TO KEEP SECRETS AND CAJOLE MEN TO HIS WILL
BUT AT THE LAST HE FELT AFRAID THERE HAD BEEN MANY CHANGES OF THAT HE FELT SURE WOULD IT STILL BE HOME AND IF NOT WOULD NOT THE LOSS BE MOST IRREPARABLE AND BITTER
WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO GO AWAY HAVING LOOKED AT IT FROM THE HILL AND HAVING HEARD THE SAGA OF THE FIRS KEEPING HIS MEMORY OF IT UNBLURRED THAN RISK THE PROBABLE DISILLUSION OF A RETURN TO THE PLACES THAT HAD FORGOTTEN HIM
FOOLISH BECAUSE THE OBJECT OF HIS QUEST WAS NOT TO BE FOUND THERE OR ELSEWHERE HE COULD NOT ENTER AGAIN INTO THE HERITAGE OF BOYHOOD AND THE HEART OF YOUTH HE COULD NOT FIND THERE THE OLD DREAMS AND HOPES THAT HAD MADE LIFE SWEET
NOT SO FAR FROM HIS OWN JUST ACROSS A GREEN MEADOW BY WAY OF A FOOTPATH AND STILE AND THROUGH THE FIRS BEYOND IT HOW OFTEN HE HAD TRAVERSED THAT PATH IN THE OLD DAYS KNOWING THAT JOYCE WOULD BE WAITING AT THE END OF IT AMONG THE FIRS
BEYOND IT AMID TALL ELMS WAS THE OLD CHURCH WITH ITS SQUARE TOWER HUNG WITH IVY HE FELT GLAD TO SEE IT HE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE A NEW CHURCH
THE SUN SET FAR OUT TO SEA AND SUCKED DOWN WITH IT ALL THE LIGHT OUT OF THE WINNOWED DOME OF SKY THE STARS CAME OUT SINGLY AND CRYSTAL CLEAR OVER THE FAR PURPLE CURVES OF THE HILLS
EVEN IN THE DIMNESS OF THE SUMMER NIGHT TO SEE THAT THE OLD HOUSE WAS DESERTED AND FALLING TO DECAY THE KITCHEN DOOR SWUNG OPEN ON RUSTY HINGES THE WINDOWS WERE BROKEN AND LIFELESS
STEPHEN CAME TO IT A STOUT GRIZZLED FARMER WITH A CHUBBY BOY ON HIS SHOULDER HE WAS NOT MUCH CHANGED CUTHBERT EASILY RECOGNIZED HIM
BUT HE TOOK BOTH AND HELD HER SO LOOKING HUNGRILY DOWN AT HER AS A MAN LOOKS AT SOMETHING HE KNOWS MUST BE HIS SALVATION IF SALVATION EXISTS FOR HIM IS IT POSSIBLE YOU ARE HERE STILL JOYCE
THE TWILIGHT IS SO KIND IT HIDES THAT BUT IT IS TRUE COME INTO THE HOUSE CUTHBERT FATHER AND MOTHER WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU AFTER A LITTLE HE SAID IMPLORINGLY LET US STAY HERE AWHILE FIRST JOYCE
REMEMBERING THAT HE HAD FORFEITED ALL RIGHT TO HER HELP IN THE QUEST YET HE REALIZED CLEARLY THAT ONLY SHE COULD HELP HIM ONLY SHE COULD GUIDE HIM BACK TO THE PATH HE HAD MISSED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE HELD IN HER KEEPING
THE BEST THAT GOD HAD MEANT FOR HIM HAD BEEN HERE IN THE HOME OF YOUTH WHEN DARKNESS CAME DOWN THROUGH THE FIRS HE TOLD HER ALL THIS HALTINGLY BLUNDERINGLY YEARNINGLY JOYCE
IS IT TOO LATE CAN YOU FORGIVE MY MISTAKE MY LONG BLINDNESS CAN YOU CARE FOR ME AGAIN A LITTLE SHE TURNED HER FACE UPWARD TO THE SKY BETWEEN THE SWAYING FIR TOPS
HE CAUGHT SYLVIA DOING THE SAME THING SO HE WHEELED AND CAME ON LOOKING MIGHTY FOOLISH AS HE PASSED BENEATH OUR WINDOW RUGGLES CHUCKLED FIENDISHLY I'VE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING POLLY HE SAID MY NAME IS PAUL
YOU CAN IMITATE THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING SO WELL BUT LOOK HERE I SAID AN UNCOMFORTABLE IDEA STRIKING ME WHAT ABOUT SYLVIA WON'T SHE FEEL KIND OF FLATTISH WHEN SHE FINDS OUT HE DIDN'T WRITE IT FOR OF COURSE HE'LL TELL HER
GEORGE OSBORNE THEN WE MAILED IT THAT VERY EVENING
THAT IS TO SAY THINGS WHICH THE EYE OR EAR OR SMELL OR TASTE OR TOUCH CAN PERCEIVE WHICH ARE CALLED OBJECTIVE OR SENSIBLE SO THE SUN BECAUSE IT CAN BE SEEN IS SAID TO BE OBJECTIVE
ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES SO LOVE IS A MENTAL REALITY AND NOT SENSIBLE FOR THIS REALITY THE EAR DOES NOT HEAR THE EYE DOES NOT SEE THE SMELL DOES NOT PERCEIVE
IN EXPLAINING THESE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES ONE IS OBLIGED TO EXPRESS THEM BY SENSIBLE FIGURES BECAUSE IN EXTERIOR EXISTENCE THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS NOT MATERIAL THEREFORE TO EXPLAIN THE REALITY OF THE SPIRIT
THIS IS AN INTELLECTUAL OR SPIRITUAL STATE TO EXPLAIN WHICH YOU ARE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO SENSIBLE FIGURES ANOTHER EXAMPLE YOU SAY SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL MADE GREAT PROGRESS
THEN IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE DOVE WHICH DESCENDED UPON CHRIST WAS NOT A MATERIAL DOVE BUT IT WAS A SPIRITUAL STATE WHICH THAT IT MIGHT BE COMPREHENSIBLE WAS EXPRESSED BY A SENSIBLE FIGURE
A SIMILE A METAPHOR AND IS NOT TO BE ACCEPTED LITERALLY IT IS NOT A STATE THAT CAN BE COMPREHENDED BY MAN SLEEPING AND WAKING IS PASSING FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER SLEEPING IS THE CONDITION OF REPOSE
AND WAKEFULNESS IS THE CONDITION OF MOVEMENT SLEEPING IS THE STATE OF SILENCE
SLEEPING IS THE STATE OF MYSTERY WAKEFULNESS IS THE STATE OF MANIFESTATION FOR EXAMPLE IT IS A PERSIAN AND ARABIC EXPRESSION TO SAY THAT THE EARTH WAS ASLEEP AND THE SPRING CAME AND IT AWOKE
WHETHER IT BE GRADUALLY OR AT ONCE THERE CAN REMAIN NO DOUBT THAT A MAN WITHOUT A HUMAN FATHER IS ALSO POSSIBLE AND ADMISSIBLE YOU CANNOT CONSIDER THIS IMPOSSIBLE OTHERWISE YOU ARE ILLOGICAL FOR EXAMPLE
BUT THE SUBSTANCE OF ABRAHAM WAS PURE SPERM IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE PURE AND CHASTE SPERM IS SUPERIOR TO EARTH FURTHERMORE IN THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN VERSES TWELVE AND THIRTEEN IT IS SAID
RECEPTACLES OF MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES IN THOSE ELEGANT CAVERNS PRINCES AND LORDS STORED THEIR PLUNDER IN SUCH A PLACE THE COUNT DE CHAROLAIS HID MADAME COURCHAMP THE WIFE OF THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL
THE BRUTAL KNIGHTS OF ELTZ OF RIZZIO OF MONALDESCHI OF NAKED SWORDS PURSUING THE FUGITIVE FLYING FROM ROOM TO ROOM THE ANCIENTS TOO HAD MYSTERIOUS RETREATS OF THE SAME KIND IN WHICH LUXURY WAS ADAPTED TO ENORMITIES
THE MAZE OF PASSAGES AND ALCOVES WITH SECRET AND BEWILDERING DOORS CHECKED AND RETARDED HIS PROGRESS HE STROVE TO RUN HE WAS OBLIGED TO WANDER HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BUT ONE DOOR TO THRUST OPEN WHILE HE HAD A SKEIN OF DOORS TO UNRAVEL
THEN HE RECOGNIZED HIMSELF BUT NOT AT ONCE HE EXPLORED EVERY PASSAGE THAT HE CAME TO HE EXAMINED THE QUAINT ARRANGEMENTS OF THE RAMBLING BUILDING AND THEIR YET QUAINTER FITTINGS HERE A CABINET
ONE OF THOSE PRETTY FLORENTINE RETREATS ADAPTED TO THE HYPOCHONDRIASIS OF WOMEN AND EVEN THEN CALLED BOUDOIRS EVERYWHERE ON THE CEILINGS ON THE WALLS AND ON THE VERY FLOORS WERE REPRESENTATIONS
REPRESENTING WARRIORS QUEENS AND TRITONS ARMED WITH THE SCALY TERMINATIONS OF A HYDRA CUT CRYSTALS COMBINING PRISMATIC EFFECTS WITH THOSE OF REFLECTION MIRRORS REPEATED THE LIGHT OF PRECIOUS STONES AND SPARKLES GLITTERED IN THE DARKEST CORNERS
WHAT A HORRIBLE PALACE HE THOUGHT RESTLESS HE WANDERED THROUGH THE MAZE ASKING HIMSELF WHAT IT ALL MEANT
AND HE CROSSED CURRENTS OF PERFUME AS THOUGH PASSING BY INVISIBLE FLOWERS IT WAS WARM CARPETS EVERYWHERE ONE MIGHT HAVE WALKED ABOUT THERE UNCLOTHED GWYNPLAINE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOWS THE VIEW FROM EACH ONE WAS DIFFERENT
THEY SHALL NOT KEEP ME HERE BY FORCE WOE TO HIM WHO BARS MY EXIT WHAT IS THAT GREAT TOWER YONDER IF THERE WAS A GIANT A HELL HOUND A MINOTAUR TO KEEP THE GATE OF THIS ENCHANTED PALACE I WOULD ANNIHILATE HIM IF AN ARMY I WOULD EXTERMINATE IT
SUDDENLY HE HEARD A GENTLE NOISE VERY FAINT IT WAS LIKE DROPPING WATER HE WAS IN A DARK NARROW PASSAGE CLOSED SOME FEW PACES FURTHER ON BY A CURTAIN HE ADVANCED TO THE CURTAIN
THEN HE BEGAN TO LICK HIS HANDS AGAIN FOR A MOMENT GWYNPLAINE WAS LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN SO GREAT IS THE SHOCK OF HOPE'S MIGHTY RETURN HOMO
THE VERY MOMENT IN WHICH ALL EXPECTATION HAS CEASED BRINGING BACK HEALTH AND DELIVERANCE A PLACE OF SAFETY DISCOVERED AT THE MOST CRITICAL INSTANT IN THE MIDST OF CRUMBLING RUINS HOMO WAS ALL THIS TO GWYNPLAINE THE WOLF APPEARED TO HIM
WHICH WE HAVE HELD TO HAVE COME FROM BELOW HAS IN REALITY COME FROM ABOVE WHO KNOWS ALL THE MYSTERIOUS FORMS ASSUMED BY GOD WHAT WAS THIS ANIMAL PROVIDENCE HAVING REACHED THE RIVER
BOTH FLAPS OF THE GANGWAY WERE LOWERED ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT ON HINGES THUS MAKING A ROOF OVER THE HOLD SO THAT THE SHIP IN HEAVY SEAS WAS HERMETICALLY CLOSED THESE SLOOPS BEING OF VERY MASSIVE CONSTRUCTION HAD A BEAM FOR A TILLER
ABOUT THAT TIME MANY EVENTS HAD OCCURRED AT SEA AND AMONGST OTHERS THE DEFEAT OF THE BARON DE POINTI'S EIGHT SHIPS OFF CAPE CARNERO WHICH HAD DRIVEN THE WHOLE FRENCH FLEET INTO REFUGE AT GIBRALTAR SO THAT THE CHANNEL WAS SWEPT OF EVERY MAN OF WAR
BUT ONE STEP TO DESCEND AND HOMO IN A BOUND AND GWYNPLAINE IN A STRIDE WERE ON BOARD THE DECK WAS CLEAR AND NO STIR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE PASSENGERS IF AS WAS LIKELY THERE WERE ANY WERE ALREADY ON BOARD
AND THE AXLETREES SEEMED WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE ALTOGETHER IT PRESENTED AN INDESCRIBABLE APPEARANCE OF BEGGARY AND PROSTRATION THE SHAFTS STUCK UP LOOKED LIKE TWO ARMS RAISED TO HEAVEN
DOES IT NOT SEEM THAT THE LAW AND THE WILL OF NATURE WOULD HAVE DICTATED GWYNPLAINE'S HEADLONG RUSH TO THROW HIMSELF UPON LIFE HAPPINESS LOVE REGAINED SO THEY WOULD
FOR A WHOLE SEMESTER ENTERED UPON HER COLLEGE CAREER IN AN ENTIRELY UNPREMEDITATED AND IMPROMPTU MANNER IT BEGAN ONE DAY AWAY BACK IN NOVEMBER
THE STUDY HAS BEEN SO FULL OF FRESHMEN ALL THE TIME THAT I TOLD HER TO HANG IT ON THE DOOR AND LET THEM JOIN OUTSIDE IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY PATTY TURNED THE LEAVES AND RAN HER EYES DOWN THE LIST OF SPRAWLING SIGNATURES IT'S A POPULAR ORGANIZATION ISN'T IT
I KNOW PRISCILLA WOULD BE GRATIFIED NO THANK YOU I PAY CLUB DUES ENOUGH ALREADY I'M AFRAID I'M NOT EXACTLY ELIGIBLE MYSELF AS I DON'T KNOW ANY GERMAN IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFULLY SHARP PENCIL THOUGH THAT I HATE NOT TO WRITE WITH IT
PRISCILLA PRODUCED THE REGISTRATION LIST AND TRIUMPHANTLY EXHIBITED AN UNMISTAKABLE KATE FERRIS THEY FORGOT TO PUT HER IN THE CATALOGUE I NEVER KNEW THEM TO MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE BEFORE SAID THE PRESIDENT DUBIOUSLY I DON'T BELIEVE WE'D BETTER PUT HER IN THE ROLL BOOK
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER PRISCILLA WAS ENGAGED IN LABORIOUSLY TURNING THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING INTO GRAMMATICAL GERMAN AND AS SHE CLOSED THE DICTIONARY AND GRAMMAR WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF SHE REMARKED TO PATTY DO YOU KNOW
THAT KATE FERRIS IS ACTUALLY COMING THROUGH ON THE OTHER SIDE IF SHE CHANGES HER MIND MANY MORE TIMES THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING LEFT
ON THE EVENING OF THE TEA AFTER THE GUESTS HAD GONE AND THE FURNITURE HAD BEEN MOVED BACK THE WEARY HOSTESSES IN SOMEWHAT RUMPLED EVENING DRESSES A CONSIDERABLE CRUSH RESULTS WHEN FIFTY ARE ENTERTAINED IN A ROOM WHOSE UTMOST CAPACITY IS FIFTEEN
I BEGIN TO THINK SO MYSELF SAID PATTY THE NEXT MORNING'S MAIL BROUGHT A BUNCH OF VIOLETS AND AN APOLOGY FROM KATE FERRIS
OR ANY PAINFUL JOB SO FULL OF PLEASURES AS THE TASK OF CONDUCTING A NEWSPAPER COLUMN THE
THERE IS NOTHING SO AMAZING TO HIM AS TO FIND THAT ANY ONE REALLY ENJOYS HIS STUFF POOR SOUL HE REMEMBERS HOW HE GROANED OVER IT AT HIS DESK HE REMEMBERS THE HOURS HE SAT WITH LACK LUSTRE EYE AND ADDLED BRAIN
I INSTANCE THIS TO SHOW THAT THE COLYUMIST IS LIKELY TO BEGIN HIS JOB WITH THE CONCEPTION THAT IT IS TO BE A PERPETUAL UPROAR OF MIRTH AND HIGH SPIRITS THIS LASTS ABOUT A WEEK
IF THE PUBLIC INSISTS ON BRINGING ITS WOES TO ITS COLYUMISTS IT DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE ANY COLYUMISTS THEN THE BATTERED JESTER TURNS AGAIN TO HIS MACHINE AND TICKS OFF SOMETHING LIKE THIS
THERE HE STOOD A SORT OF UNSUCCESSFUL CYRUS CURTIS VERY DIMINUTIVE HIS GRAY HAIR RATHER LONG ABAFT HIS NECK HIS YELLOWISH STRAW HAT WITH CURLY BRIM TILTED BACKWARD AS THOUGH IN PERPLEXITY
AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO HIM I HALTED AT A WINDOW FARTHER DOWN THE STREET AND STUDIED HIM THEN RETURNED TO PASS HIM AGAIN AND WATCHED HIM PATIENTLY HE STOOD QUITE ABSORBED AND WAS STILL THERE WHEN I WENT ON
THIS IS THE COLYUMIST'S TASK AS I SEE IT IT IS A TASK NOT A WHIT LESS WORTHY LESS PAINFUL OR LESS BAFFLING THAN THAT OF THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS NOVELIST
YOU MAY KNOW HIM BY A SUNKEN BROODING EYE CLOTHING MARRED BY MUCH TOBACCO AND A CHAFED AND TETCHY HUMOUR TOWARD THE HOUR OF FIVE P M HAVING BITTERLY SCHOOLED HIMSELF TO SEE MEN AS PARAGRAPHS WALKING
AND I WAS JUST GOING TO MAKE YOU A PRESENT THAT IS WORTH MORE THAN FIVE FRANCS TO A FELLOW LIKE YOU WHAT IS IT SHOW IT TO ME
COME A LITTLE NEARER TO THE WELL NO ONE KNOWS WHO MAY BE BEHIND THOSE TREES NOW LISTEN CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IS GOING WRONG WITH DIETRICH HE NEVER WHISTLES NOW HE NEVER LAUGHS AND HIS MOTHER LOOKS SO SAD AND SHE RARELY SPEAKS EVEN TO ANSWER WHEN SPOKEN TO
IN THE COURSE OF TEN DAYS I RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY FROM MY INJURIES TO ATTEND SCHOOL WHERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE I WAS LOOKED UPON AS A HERO ON ACCOUNT OF HAVING BEEN BLOWN UP WHAT DON'T WE MAKE A HERO OF
THIS WAS AN HONOR TO WHICH I HAD LONG ASPIRED BUT BEING A NEW BOY I WAS NOT ADMITTED TO THE FRATERNITY UNTIL MY CHARACTER HAD FULLY DEVELOPED ITSELF IT WAS A VERY SELECT SOCIETY THE OBJECT OF WHICH I NEVER FATHOMED
THE INITIATION CEREMONY TOOK PLACE IN FRED LANGDON'S BARN WHERE I WAS SUBMITTED TO A SERIES OF TRIALS NOT CALCULATED TO SOOTHE THE NERVES OF A TIMOROUS BOY BEFORE BEING LED TO THE GROTTO OF ENCHANTMENT
SUCH WAS THE MODEST TITLE GIVEN TO THE LOFT OVER MY FRIEND'S WOOD HOUSE MY HANDS WERE SECURELY PINIONED AND MY EYES COVERED WITH A THICK SILK HANDKERCHIEF AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS I WAS TOLD IN AN UNRECOGNIZABLE HUSKY VOICE
THE UNKNOWN VOICE THEN DIRECTED ME TO TAKE TEN STEPS FORWARD AND STOP AT THE WORD HALT I TOOK TEN STEPS AND HALTED STRICKEN MORTAL SAID A SECOND HUSKY VOICE MORE HUSKY IF POSSIBLE THAN THE FIRST
GENTLY CHECKED MY RETREAT I WAS THEN CONDUCTED TO THE BRINK OF SEVERAL OTHER PRECIPICES AND ORDERED TO STEP OVER MANY DANGEROUS CHASMS WHERE THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTANT DEATH IF I HAD COMMITTED THE LEAST MISTAKE
BY THESE SIMPLE AND INGENIOUS MEASURES WE KEPT OUR TREASURY IN A FLOURISHING CONDITION SOMETIMES HAVING ON HAND AS MUCH AS A DOLLAR AND A QUARTER I HAVE SAID THAT THE SOCIETY HAD NO SPECIAL OBJECT IT IS TRUE THERE WAS A TACIT UNDERSTANDING AMONG US
AND NOW HE HAD CAUSED US TO BE ARRAIGNED BEFORE JUSTICE CLAPHAM ON A CHARGE EQUALLY GROUNDLESS AND PAINFUL AFTER MUCH NOISY DISCUSSION A PLAN OF RETALIATION WAS AGREED UPON
CASTING DESTRUCTIVE GLANCES ACROSS THE STREET THE ARTIFICIAL ROSES IN HER CAP AND HER WHOLE LANGUISHING MANNER SAYING AS PLAINLY AS A LABEL ON A PRESCRIPTION TO BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY BUT MISTER MEEKS DIDN'T TAKE
TO KILL LESS THAN THREE BIRDS WITH ONE STONE DID NOT SUIT OUR SANGUINARY PURPOSE WE DISLIKED THE WIDOW NOT SO MUCH FOR HER SENTIMENTALITY AS FOR BEING THE MOTHER OF BILL CONWAY WE DISLIKED MISTER MEEKS NOT BECAUSE HE WAS INSIPID
LIKE HIS OWN SYRUPS BUT BECAUSE THE WIDOW LOVED HIM BILL CONWAY WE HATED FOR HIMSELF LATE ONE DARK SATURDAY NIGHT IN SEPTEMBER WE CARRIED OUR PLAN INTO EFFECT
IT WAS A CUSTOM WITH THE LARGER PUPILS TO RETURN TO THE PLAYGROUND AFTER SCHOOL AND PLAY BASEBALL UNTIL SUNDOWN THE TOWN AUTHORITIES HAD PROHIBITED BALL PLAYING ON THE SQUARE AND THERE BEING NO OTHER AVAILABLE PLACE
THE OCCASION MAY COME ROUND WHEN A DECENT PROFICIENCY IN ONE OR THE REST OF THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WILL BE OF SERVICE TO YOU IN ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS
IT'S QUITE RIGHT AND JUSTIFIABLE IF DONE FROM A SIMPLE AVERSION TO PHYSICAL PAIN AND DANGER BUT DON'T SAY NO BECAUSE YOU FEAR A LICKING AND SAY OR THINK IT'S BECAUSE YOU FEAR GOD FOR THAT'S NEITHER CHRISTIAN NOR HONEST AND IF YOU DO FIGHT
CONVINCED OF MY ERROR I ACCEPTED HIS CONGRATULATIONS WITH THOSE OF THE OTHER BOYS BLANDLY AND BLINDLY I REMEMBER THAT BINNY WALLACE WANTED TO GIVE ME HIS SILVER PENCIL CASE
MISS ABIGAIL OPENING THE FRONT DOOR STARTED BACK AT MY HILARIOUS APPEARANCE I TRIED TO SMILE UPON HER SWEETLY BUT THE SMILE RIPPLING OVER MY SWOLLEN CHEEK AND DYING AWAY LIKE A SPENT WAVE ON MY NOSE
CAPTAIN NUTTER AS THE RECOGNIZED PROFESSIONAL WARRIOR OF OUR FAMILY COULD NOT CONSISTENTLY TAKE ME TO TASK FOR FIGHTING CONWAY NOR WAS HE DISPOSED TO DO SO
FOR THE CAPTAIN WAS WELL AWARE OF THE LONG CONTINUED PROVOCATION I HAD ENDURED AH YOU RASCAL CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AFTER HEARING MY STORY JUST LIKE ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG ALWAYS IN ONE KIND OF TROUBLE OR ANOTHER
I BELIEVE IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY I THINK SAID MISS ABIGAIL WITHOUT THE FAINTEST EXPRESSION ON HER COUNTENANCE THAT A TABLE SPOONFUL OF HOT DRO THE CAPTAIN INTERRUPTED MISS ABIGAIL PEREMPTORILY
THAT CONWAY HAD IMPOSED ON ME EVER SINCE MY FIRST DAY AT THE TEMPLE SCHOOL THEIR EVIDENCE ALSO WENT TO SHOW THAT CONWAY WAS A QUARRELSOME CHARACTER GENERALLY BAD FOR CONWAY SETH RODGERS ON THE PART OF HIS FRIEND
PROVED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE FIRST BLOW THAT WAS BAD FOR ME IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID BINNY WALLACE HOLDING UP HIS HAND FOR PERMISSION TO SPEAK BAILEY DIDN'T FIGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE FOUGHT ON MY ACCOUNT AND IF YOU PLEASE SIR
YOU CAN GO TO YOUR SEATS SAID MISTER GRIMSHAW TURNING HIS FACE ASIDE TO HIDE A SMILE I AM SURE MY APOLOGY WAS A VERY GOOD ONE I NEVER HAD ANY MORE TROUBLE WITH CONWAY
HE AND HIS SHADOW SETH RODGERS GAVE ME A WIDE BERTH FOR MANY MONTHS NOR WAS BINNY WALLACE SUBJECTED TO FURTHER MOLESTATION MISS ABIGAIL'S SANITARY STORES INCLUDING A BOTTLE OF OPODELDOC WERE NEVER CALLED INTO REQUISITION
PATRICK DEASEY DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS A PHILOSOPHER PSYCHOLOGIST AND HUMORIST IT WAS PARTLY BECAUSE PATRICK DELIGHTED IN LONG WORDS AND PARTLY TO EXCUSE HIMSELF
TO RING AT THE FRONT DOOR OF ORDINARY INTERCOURSE WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR HIM WHEN DEASEY INVESTED HIS WIFE'S MONEY IN A PUBLIC HOUSE HE DEVELOPED A BETTER PLAN IT WAS THE PLAN WHICH MADE HIM ULTIMATELY DESCRIBE HIMSELF
AND SOMETIMES THE WHOLE SKELETON WOULD RATTLE OUT UPON THE FLOOR HE HAD PLAYED THIS GAME SO OFTEN THAT ALMOST AT FIRST SIGHT HE COULD CLASSIFY HIS DUPES
HAS BEEN INADVERTENTLY REVEALED TO ME BUT IS FOR EVER SACRED IN ME BREAST IT WAS STRANGE TO SEE HOW FROM THE UNDERWORLD OF THE MAN'S MIND THERE WOULD TRIP OUT THE COMPANY OF MISSHAPEN HOBGOBLINS
DEASEY HAD CRAVED FOR CORPSES BUT NOTHING SO GRIM AS THAT HAD RISEN TO HIS WHISKY BAIT UNTIL HE TRIED THE SAME OLD GAME ON MISSUS GERAGHTY WHAT SUBTLE INSTINCT WAS IT THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO ADD
AND THE TWO BRIGHT EYES OF IT AND THE LITTLE CLAY COLD FEET DEASEY KNEW WHAT WAS COMING NOW AND HE TWITCHED IN EVERY VEIN AND SHE SO WHITE HAIRED AND SO REGULAR AT CHURCH
BUT I HAD BAD TEETH IN ME HEAD AND I COULDN'T GET MY REST WITH THE JAWS ACHING AND ALL THE WHILES IT SCREECHING WITH THE CROUP TWOULD MADDEN YOU ALL THE SAME DEASEY WHISPERED
OURS ARE NOT THE CAROLLINGS OF YOUR POOR SHIVERING LITTLE EAST ANGLES OR SOUTH MERCIANS WHERE THEY HAVE TO PLOD ROUND AFOOT IN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT A SLEIGH RIDE IS
HOWLAND IS ALWAYS GOOD ABOUT SUCH THINGS KNEW WHAT THE SLEIGH WAS FOR HAVING DONE THE SAME IN OTHER YEARS AND DOUBLED THE SPAN OF HORSES OF HIS OWN ACCORD BECAUSE THE CHILDREN WOULD LIKE IT BETTER AND IT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
LITTLE DID CLEMENT THINK OF BELLS AND SNOW AS HE TAUGHT IT IN HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL THERE IN ALEXANDRIA BUT PERHAPS TO DAY AS THEY PIN UP THE LAURELS AND THE PALM IN THE CHAPEL AT ALEXANDRIA
HALIBURTON CAME RUNNING OUT AND BEGGED ME TO BRING THEM IN BUT I TOLD HIM NO AS SOON AS I COULD HUSH THEIR SHOUTS OF MERRY CHRISTMAS THAT WE HAD A LONG JOURNEY BEFORE US AND MUST NOT ALIGHT BY THE WAY
KISSES FLUNG FROM THE WINDOW KISSES FLUNG BACK FROM THE STREET MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN WITH A GOOD WILL AND THEN ONE OF THE GIRLS BEGAN WHEN ANNA TOOK THE BABY AND PRESSED HIS LIPS TO HERS
JESUS IN HIS BABES ABIDING AND THEN WE CAME UP HANOVER STREET AND STOPPED UNDER MISTER GERRY'S CHAPEL WHERE THEY WERE DRESSING THE WALLS WITH THEIR EVERGREENS AND GAVE THEM HAIL TO THE NIGHT HAIL TO THE DAY
KING OF GLORY KING OF PEACE HEAR THE SONG AND SEE THE STAR WELCOME BE THOU HEAVENLY KING
AND THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES ARE AGAINST SISERA WITH THE SHERIFF AND MISTER CAMP I THEN WALKED OVER TO THE SALOON WHERE JUDGE WILSON WAS WAITING TO DISPOSE OF MY CASE
AND ANSWERED THAT I ASKED AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE CASE SO THAT I MIGHT BE HEARD BY COUNSEL IT WAS DENIED AS WAS TO HAVE BEEN EXPECTED INDEED WHY THEY TOOK THE TROUBLE TO GO THROUGH THE FORMS WAS BEYOND ME
ON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER FOURTEENTH AND ASK THAT HE BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY ON THAT CHARGE I COULDN'T MAKE OUT THIS NEW MOVE AND PUZZLED OVER IT WHILE JUDGE WILSON ORDERED MY COMMITMENT
BUT THE NEXT STEP REVEALED THE OBJECT FOR THE LAWYER THEN ASKED FOR A SEARCH WARRANT TO LOOK FOR STOLEN PROPERTY THE JUDGE WAS EQUALLY OBLIGING AND BEGAN TO FILL ONE OUT ON THE INSTANT
THERE WEREN'T MANY MOMENTS IN WHICH TO THINK WHILE THE JUDGE SCRIBBLED AWAY AT THE WARRANT BUT IN WHAT TIME THERE WAS I DID A LOT OF HEAD WORK WITHOUT HOWEVER FINDING MORE THAN ONE WAY OUT OF THE SNARL
THE THREE CONSPIRATORS JUMPED TO THEIR FEET AND BOLTED FOR THE WINDOW
AND PUT THE LETTERS INTO THE RAILROAD AGENT'S SAFE WHEN I REACHED THE MAIN STREET I SAW THAT MY HOPE WAS FUTILE FOR ANOTHER BATCH OF COWBOYS WERE COMING IN FULL GALLOP TOWARDS ME VERY THOROUGHLY HEADING ME OFF IN THAT DIRECTION
TO ESCAPE THEM I HEADED UP THE STREET AWAY FROM THE STATION WITH THE PACK IN CLOSE PURSUIT THEY YELLED AT ME TO HOLD UP AND I EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT TO HEAR THE CRACK OF REVOLVERS
IN EXPECTATION OF HEARING THE SHOOTING BEGIN AND TO KNOW THAT ANY MOMENT MAY BE YOUR LAST I DON'T SUPPOSE I WAS ON THE RAGGED EDGE MORE THAN THIRTY SECONDS BUT THEY WERE ENOUGH TO PROVE TO ME THAT
TO KEEP ONE'S BACK TURNED TO AN ENEMY AS ONE RUNS AWAY TAKES A DEAL MORE PLUCK THAN TO STAND UP AND FACE HIS GUN FORTUNATELY FOR ME MY PURSUERS FELT SO SURE OF MY CAPTURE
AFRAID TO SHOUT ANYTHING WHICH SHOULD CONVEY THE SLIGHTEST CLUE AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE LETTERS AS THE NEXT BEST THING I PULLED A COUPLE OF OLD SECTION REPORTS FROM MY POCKET
INTENDING TO RIDE UP AND RUN INTO MY CAR FOR I KNEW THAT THE PAPERS IN MY HAND WOULD BE TAKEN TO BE THE WANTED LETTERS AND THAT IF I COULD ONLY GET INSIDE THE CAR EVEN FOR A MOMENT THE SUSPICION WOULD BE THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO HIDE THEM
I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE FOR TO NIGHT GOOD NIGHT THEN WE SHALL MEET THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW AND SO THE TWO PARTED AND WENT THEIR SEVERAL WAYS TO REST ON THE APPOINTED DAY GENZABURO MADE HIS PREPARATIONS AND WENT IN DISGUISE WITHOUT ANY RETAINERS
WELL THEN SAID GENZABURO GREATLY PLEASED AND DRAWING TEN RIYOS FROM HIS BOSOM THIS IS BUT A SMALL PRESENT TO MAKE TO YOU ON MY FIRST VISIT BUT PRAY ACCEPT IT NO INDEED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR LORDSHIP WISHES OF ME
LAID HIS PLANS ACCORDINGLY AND WENT OFF TO THE HOUSE OF KIHACHI THE ETA CHIEF AND TOLD HIM THE COMMISSION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED KIHACHI WAS OF COURSE GREATLY ASTONISHED AND SAID SOME TIME AGO SIR CHOKICHI CAME HERE
BUT WHEN I TELL HER WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID HOW GLAD AND HAPPY SHE WILL BE LET ME GO AND TALK TO HER AT ONCE
WELL AT ANY RATE I HAVE SOME NEWS FOR YOU THAT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY A MESSENGER HAS COME FROM MY LORD GENZABURO FOR WHOM YOUR HEART YEARNS AT THIS O KOYO WHO HAD BEEN CROUCHING DOWN LIKE A DROOPING FLOWER GAVE A GREAT START AND CRIED OUT IS THAT REALLY TRUE
IT IS CHOKICHI WHO HAS BEEN THROWING OBSTACLES IN THE WAY AT LAST HIS LORDSHIP HAS SECRETLY SENT A MAN CALLED KAJI SAZEN A FORTUNE TELLER TO ARRANGE AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN YOU SO NOW MY CHILD YOU MAY CHEER UP
AND GO TO MEET YOUR LOVER AS SOON AS YOU PLEASE WHEN O KOYO HEARD THIS SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE THOUGHT IT MUST ALL BE A DREAM AND DOUBTED HER OWN SENSES KIHACHI IN THE MEANWHILE REJOINED SAZEN IN THE OTHER ROOM AND
AND GOING IN AT ONCE SAID TO THE FORTUNE TELLER
LOST HEART ENTIRELY AND MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO HOME AGAIN SAZEN HOWEVER PRESSED HIM SO EAGERLY THAT AT LAST HE WENT UPSTAIRS TO SEE THIS VAUNTED BEAUTY AND SAZEN DRAWING ASIDE A SCREEN SHOWED HIM O KOYO WHO WAS SITTING THERE
ONE DAY AS THEY WERE FEASTING AND ENJOYING THEMSELVES IN AN UPPER STOREY IN SAZEN'S HOUSE CHOKICHI CAME TO THE HOUSE AND SAID I BEG PARDON BUT DOES ONE MASTER SAZEN LIVE HERE CERTAINLY SIR I AM SAZEN AT YOUR SERVICE
AND MY NAME IS CHOKICHI I BEG TO BESPEAK YOUR GOODWILL FOR MYSELF I HOPE WE MAY BE FRIENDS SAZEN WAS NOT A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK AT THIS HOWEVER HE PUT ON AN INNOCENT FACE AS THOUGH HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF CHOKICHI BEFORE AND SAID
THERE IS NO O KOYO HERE AND I NEVER SAW SUCH A PERSON IN MY LIFE CHOKICHI QUIETLY DREW OUT OF THE BOSOM OF HIS DRESS THE LETTER FROM SAZEN TO KIHACHI WHICH HE HAD PICKED UP A FEW DAYS BEFORE AND SHOWING IT TO SAZEN REPLIED
SAZEN THEN LOOKING AROUND HIM AND SEEING TO HIS GREAT DELIGHT THAT THERE WAS NO ONE NEAR RETURNED HOME THE FOLLOWING DAY CHOKICHI'S BODY WAS FOUND BY THE POLICE AND WHEN THEY EXAMINED IT THEY FOUND NOTHING UPON IT SAVE A PAPER WHICH THEY READ
AS HE HAD DISGRACED HIS POSITION AS A HATAMOTO BY CONTRACTING AN ALLIANCE WITH THE DAUGHTER OF AN ETA HIS PROPERTY SHOULD BE CONFISCATED HIS FAMILY BLOTTED OUT AND HIMSELF BANISHED AS FOR KIHACHI THE ETA CHIEF AND HIS DAUGHTER O KOYO
THE THIRTY SIXTH LAW PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS ALL WANDERING MENDICANTS SUCH AS MALE SORCERERS FEMALE DIVINERS HERMITS BLIND PEOPLE BEGGARS AND TANNERS ETAS HAVE HAD FROM OF OLD THEIR RESPECTIVE RULERS
THUS THEIR RACE IS POLLUTED AND ACCURSED AND THEY ARE HATED ACCORDINGLY NOW THIS IS HOW THE ETAS CAME TO BE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF DANZAYEMON WHEN MINAMOTO NO YORITOMO WAS YET A CHILD HIS FATHER MINAMOTO NO YOSHITOMO
AND THEIR MOTHER WAS LEDA WHO AFTER THE TWIN BROTHERS HAD ANOTHER CHILD BORN TO HER HELEN FOR WHOSE SAKE THE SONS OF MANY OF JASON'S FRIENDS WERE TO WAGE WAR AGAINST THE GREAT CITY OF TROY
THEY BEGAN TO FELL TREES FOR THE TIMBERS OF THE SHIP THAT WAS TO MAKE THE VOYAGE TO FAR COLCHIS
WHEN THE SHIP WAS BUILT AND MADE READY FOR THE VOYAGE A NAME WAS GIVEN TO IT THE ARGO IT WAS CALLED
STRIFE AND PURSUIT AND FLIGHT TUMULT AND PANIC AND SLAUGHTER THE FIGURE OF FATE WAS THERE DRAGGING A DEAD MAN BY THE FEET
AROUND THESE FIGURES WERE HEADS OF SNAKES HEADS WITH BLACK JAWS AND GLITTERING EYES TWELVE HEADS SUCH AS MIGHT AFFRIGHT ANY MAN
OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL OF THE SAME NATURE THAT THE WATER OF THE CHANNEL HAD BEEN RAISED LIKE A DOME THE BOTTOM OF THE BRIG CRUSHED IN AND SHE HAD SUNK INSTANTLY THE DAMAGE DONE TO HER HULL
WHAT HIS OBJECT CAN BE IN ACTING THUS IN CONCEALING HIMSELF AFTER RENDERING US SO MANY SERVICES I CANNOT UNDERSTAND BUT HIS SERVICES ARE NOT THE LESS REAL
THAT IT WAS HE WHO LIGHTED THAT FIRE ON THE HEIGHTS OF THE ISLAND WHICH PERMITTED YOU TO LAND THAT IT WAS HE WHO FIRED THAT BULLET FOUND IN THE BODY OF THE PECCARY THAT IT WAS HE WHO PLUNGED THAT TORPEDO INTO THE CHANNEL WHICH DESTROYED THE BRIG
IS IT HE WHO IS IN SECRET COMMUNICATION WITH US BY THE WELL IN GRANITE HOUSE AND HAS HE THUS A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL OUR PLANS WAS IT HE WHO THREW US THAT BOTTLE WHEN THE VESSEL MADE HER FIRST CRUISE
AND YOU MY BOY GIVE US YOUR OPINION SAID THE ENGINEER TURNING TO HERBERT OH CRIED HERBERT HIS COUNTENANCE FULL OF ANIMATION HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO THANK HIM HE WHO SAVED YOU FIRST AND WHO HAS NOW SAVED US
TRY THEM PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER HOWEVER I THINK THAT IN MAKING THE EXPERIMENT WE OUGHT TO EMPLOY
AND NOW THE PIECES WERE AS BRILLIANT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ON BOARD A FRIGATE OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY ON THIS DAY THEREFORE IN PRESENCE OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COLONY INCLUDING MASTER JUP AND TOP THE FOUR CANNON WERE SUCCESSIVELY TRIED
BELIEVE ME PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO HAVE TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENT WELL SAID THE SAILOR WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE WITH REGARD TO THOSE SIX VILLAINS WHO ARE ROAMING ABOUT THE ISLAND
HE HAS AS MUCH RIGHT TO SPEAK HERE AS ANY ONE YES SAID GIDEON SPILETT BUT HIS RESERVE DOES HIM HONOR AND IT IS RIGHT TO RESPECT THE FEELING WHICH HE HAS ABOUT HIS SAD PAST CERTAINLY MISTER SPILETT ANSWERED THE SAILOR
PENCROFT THINK OF AYRTON SAID HERBERT TAKING THE SAILOR'S HAND HE BECAME AN HONEST MAN AGAIN PENCROFT LOOKED AT HIS COMPANIONS ONE AFTER THE OTHER HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HIS PROPOSAL BEING MET WITH ANY OBJECTION
THEY ARE SIX AND WELL ARMED IF THEY EACH LAY HID IN A CORNER AND EACH FIRED AT ONE OF US THEY WOULD SOON BE MASTERS OF THE COLONY WHY HAVE THEY NOT DONE SO SAID HERBERT NO DOUBT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THEIR INTEREST TO DO IT BESIDES WE ARE SIX ALSO
YOU HAVE ALWAYS SHOWN MUCH DEFERENCE TO MY ADVICE WILL YOU IN THIS MATTER YIELD TO ME I WILL DO AS YOU PLEASE CAPTAIN HARDING ANSWERED THE SAILOR WHO WAS NOT AT ALL CONVINCED VERY WELL WAIT
AND NOW SIX CONVICTS OF THE WORST DESCRIPTION PERHAPS WERE ROAMING OVER THEIR ISLAND IT WAS SERIOUS CERTAINLY AND TO LESS BRAVE MEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SECURITY LOST NO MATTER
THERE HE FOUND A CONVICT WHO AIMING AT HIM SENT A BALL THROUGH HIS HAT IN A FEW SECONDS BEFORE HE HAD EVEN TIME TO FIRE HIS SECOND BARREL HE FELL STRUCK TO THE HEART BY HARDING'S DAGGER MORE SURE EVEN THAN HIS GUN DURING THIS TIME
PENCROFT WAS SILENT BUT A REACTION SET IN AND GREAT TEARS ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS IN THE MEANWHILE GIDEON SPILETT ENDEAVORED TO COLLECT HIS IDEAS AND PROCEED METHODICALLY AFTER HIS EXAMINATION HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE BALL
IT DID NOT APPEAR NECESSARY TO GIDEON SPILETT THAT A FRESH FLOW OF BLOOD SHOULD BE CAUSED BY BATHING THEM IN TEPID WATER AND COMPRESSING THEIR LIPS THE HEMORRHAGE HAD BEEN VERY ABUNDANT AND HERBERT WAS ALREADY TOO MUCH ENFEEBLED BY THE LOSS OF BLOOD
CYRUS SAID HE I AM NOT A SURGEON I AM IN TERRIBLE PERPLEXITY YOU MUST AID ME WITH YOUR ADVICE YOUR EXPERIENCE TAKE COURAGE MY FRIEND ANSWERED THE ENGINEER PRESSING THE REPORTER'S HAND JUDGE COOLLY
SINCE IT HAS BEEN FOUND BY EXPERIENCE THAT CONTACT WITH THE AIR IS DANGEROUS DURING THE FIRST DAYS GIDEON SPILETT AND CYRUS HARDING REASONED THUS WITH THEIR SIMPLE GOOD SENSE AND THEY ACTED AS THE BEST SURGEON WOULD HAVE DONE
HERBERT'S LIFE HUNG ON A THREAD AND THIS THREAD MIGHT BREAK AT ANY MOMENT THE NEXT DAY THE TWELFTH OF NOVEMBER THE HOPES OF HARDING AND HIS COMPANIONS SLIGHTLY REVIVED HERBERT HAD COME OUT OF HIS LONG STUPOR HE OPENED HIS EYES HE RECOGNIZED CYRUS HARDING
EVEN THE BALL HAS TRAVERSED THE LUNGS BUT THE PERFORATION OF THIS ORGAN IS NOT FATAL GOD BLESS YOU ANSWERED PENCROFT AS MAY BE BELIEVED DURING THE FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS THEY HAD BEEN IN THE CORRAL THE COLONISTS HAD NO OTHER THOUGHT THAN THAT OF NURSING HERBERT
THEY DID NOT THINK EITHER OF THE DANGER WHICH THREATENED THEM SHOULD THE CONVICTS RETURN OR OF THE PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN FOR THE FUTURE BUT ON THIS DAY WHILE PENCROFT WATCHED BY THE SICK BED CYRUS HARDING AND THE REPORTER CONSULTED AS TO WHAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO DO
TERRIFIED BY THE VOICE AND THE FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE OF THE HEROES THE SHEPHERD RETREATS HURRIEDLY LOCKING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
HAD ASSERTED THEMSELVES AND EXTENDED THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE THE STATE OF URARTU WAS OF GROWING IMPORTANCE AND THE NAIRI TRIBES HAD SPREAD ROUND THE SOUTH EASTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
THE FORMER HAD RAIDED NORTH SYRIA AND APPARENTLY PENETRATED AS FAR AS THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST IN CONSEQUENCE HE CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH BABYLONIA BUT HE ULTIMATELY FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT KINGDOM HIS SON TUKULTI NINIP
INAUGURATED A VERITABLE REIGN OF TERROR IN MESOPOTAMIA AND NORTHERN SYRIA HIS METHODS OF DEALING WITH REVOLTING TRIBES WERE OF A MOST SAVAGE CHARACTER CHIEFS WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND WHEN HE SACKED THEIR CITIES
THESE HE DISPOSED OF WITH CHARACTERISTIC BARBARITY SOME WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND SOME IMPALED ON STAKES WHILE OTHERS WERE ENCLOSED IN A PILLAR WHICH THE KING HAD ERECTED TO REMIND THE ARAMAEANS OF HIS DETERMINATION TO BROOK NO OPPOSITION
THE CITY OF TELLO WAS VERY STRONG
THEY DID NOT COME DOWN OR EMBRACE MY FEET WITH BATTLE AND SLAUGHTER I ASSAULTED AND TOOK THE CITY THREE THOUSAND WARRIORS I SLEW IN BATTLE THEIR BOOTY AND POSSESSIONS CATTLE SHEEP I CARRIED AWAY
I REARED A COLUMN OF THE LIVING AND A COLUMN OF HEADS I HUNG ON HIGH THEIR HEADS ON TREES IN THE VICINITY OF THEIR CITY THEIR BOYS AND GIRLS I BURNED UP IN FLAMES I DEVASTATED THE CITY DUG IT UP IN FIRE BURNED IT
HE WAS SO GREATLY FEARED BY THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES THAT WHEN HE APPROACHED THEIR TERRITORY THEY SENT HIM TRIBUTE YIELDING WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
ON ONE OCCASION ASHUR NATSIR PAL SWEPT SOUTHWARD THROUGH THIS REGION AND ATTACKED A COMBINED FORCE OF SUKHI ARAMAEANS AND BABYLONIANS THE BABYLONIANS WERE COMMANDED BY ZABDANU
HAVING ACCUMULATED GREAT BOOTY HE ENGAGED HIMSELF AS SOON AS PEACE WAS SECURED THROUGHOUT HIS EMPIRE IN REBUILDING THE CITY OF KALKHI WHERE HE ERECTED A GREAT PALACE AND MADE RECORDS OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS
WHO HAS GIVEN A VIVID DESCRIPTION OF THE VERDANT PLAIN ON WHICH THE ANCIENT CITY WAS SITUATED AS IT APPEARED IN SPRING ITS PASTURE LANDS KNOWN AS THE JAIF ARE RENOWNED HE WROTE
KESHAF ANOTHER VENERABLE RUIN ROSE INDISTINCTLY INTO THE EVENING MIST STILL MORE DISTANT AND STILL MORE INDISTINCT WAS A SOLITARY HILL OVERLOOKING THE ANCIENT CITY OF ARBELA
THE ASSYRIAN SCULPTURES OF THIS PERIOD LACK THE TECHNICAL SKILL THE DELICACY AND IMAGINATION OF SUMERIAN AND AKKADIAN ART BUT THEY ARE FULL OF ENERGY DIGNIFIED AND MASSIVE AND STRONG AND LIFELIKE
THEY REFLECT THE SPIRIT OF ASSYRIA'S GREATNESS WHICH HOWEVER HAD A MATERIALISTIC BASIS ASSYRIAN ART FOUND EXPRESSION IN DELINEATING THE OUTWARD FORM RATHER THAN IN STRIVING TO CREATE A THING OF BEAUTY WHICH IS A JOY FOR EVER
AS SHALMANESER WAS THE FIRST ASSYRIAN KING WHO CAME INTO DIRECT TOUCH WITH THE HEBREWS IT WILL BE OF INTEREST HERE TO REVIEW THE HISTORY OF THE DIVIDED KINGDOMS OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH AS RECORDED IN THE BIBLE
AND HE SHALL ROOT UP ISRAEL OUT OF THIS GOOD LAND WHICH HE GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS AND SHALL SCATTER THEM BEYOND THE RIVER
ALSO HE TOOK AWAY OUT OF ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH THE HIGH PLACES AND THE IMAGES
THE SON OF TABRIMON THE SON OF HEZION KING OF SYRIA THAT DWELT AT DAMASCUS SAYING THERE IS A LEAGUE BETWEEN ME AND THEE AND BETWEEN MY FATHER AND THY FATHER BEHOLD
SHALMANESER THE THIRD OF ASSYRIA FOUND IT NECESSARY TO INVADE BABYLONIA
WAS SUPPORTED BY AN ARAMAEAN ARMY WAS DEFEATED AND PUT TO DEATH
THUS SAITH THE LORD I HAVE ANOINTED THEE KING OVER ISRAEL AND THOU SHALT SMITE THE HOUSE OF AHAB THY MASTER THAT I MAY AVENGE THE BLOOD OF MY SERVANTS THE PROPHETS AND THE BLOOD OF ALL THE SERVANTS OF THE LORD
AND THE DRIVING IS LIKE THE DRIVING OF JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI FOR HE DRIVETH FURIOUSLY KING JORAM WENT OUT HIMSELF TO MEET THE FAMOUS CHARIOTEER
AND SAID TREASON TREASON THEN JEHOIADA THE PRIEST BROUGHT OUT THE CAPTAINS OF HUNDREDS THAT WERE SET OVER THE HOST
AND HE DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF BEN HADAD THE SON OF HAZAEL ALL THEIR DAYS THEN JEHOAHAZ REPENTED HE BESOUGHT THE LORD AND THE LORD HEARKENED UNTO HIM FOR HE SAW THE OPPRESSION OF ISRAEL
AND KEPT HIS GENERALS CONTINUALLY EMPLOYED SUPPRESSING REVOLTS ON HIS FRONTIERS AFTER HE SUBDUED THE HITTITES
THE GREAT EMPIRE WAS SUDDENLY SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS BY THE OUTBREAK OF CIVIL WAR THE PARTY OF REBELLION WAS LED BY SHALMANESER'S SON ASHUR DANIN APLI
AFTER FOUR YEARS OF CIVIL WAR SHALMANESER DIED HIS CHOSEN HEIR
URARTU IN THE NORTH HAD GROWN MORE AGGRESSIVE THE SYRIANS WERE OPENLY DEFIANT THE MEDES WERE CONDUCTING BOLD RAIDS
BUT WAS DEFEATED IN A FIERCE BATTLE ON THE BANKS OF THE DABAN CANAL
IN THE END HE TOOK PRISONER THE NEW KING
AND IN NINETEEN O FIVE IT WAS LAUNCHED IT WAS A DISTINCT IMPROVEMENT UPON ITS PREDECESSORS THE AIRSHIP WAS FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN FEET IN LENGTH BY THIRTY EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER WAS EQUIPPED WITH SEVENTEEN GAS BALLOONS
WHICH CAUSED ANOTHER PERIOD OF INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS HIS INVENTION PROBABLY NOTHING MORE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARD OF THE ZEPPELIN AFTER THIS LAST ACCIDENT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE INTERVENTION OF THE PRUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AT THE DIRECT INSTIGATION OF THE KAISER
AND EQUIPPED WITH TWO MOTORS DEVELOPING ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY HORSE POWER UPON COMPLETION IT WAS SUBMITTED TO SEVERAL PRELIMINARY FLIGHTS WHICH WERE SO EMINENTLY SUCCESSFUL THAT THE INVENTOR DECIDED TO MAKE A TRIAL TRIP UNDER CONDITIONS CLOSELY ANALOGOUS
IT HAD AN AIRSHIP WHICH COULD GO ANYWHERE IRRESPECTIVE OF CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND IN TRUE TEUTON PERSPECTIVE THE CRAFT WAS VIEWED FROM THE MILITARY STANDPOINT HERE WAS A MEANS OF OBTAINING THE MASTERY OF THE AIR
A FORMIDABLE ENGINE OF INVASION AND AERIAL ATTACK HAD BEEN PERFECTED CONSEQUENTLY THE GRAND IDEA MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH UNBOUNDED ENTHUSIASM THE COUNT WAS HAILED BY HIS AUGUST MASTER AS THE GREATEST GERMAN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
AND IN THIS APPRECIATION THE POPULACE WHOLEHEARTEDLY CONCURRED WHETHER SUCH A PANEGYRIC FROM SUCH AN AUSPICIOUS QUARTER IS PRAISE INDEED OR THE EQUIVALENT OF COMPLETE CONDEMNATION HISTORY ALONE WILL BE ABLE TO JUDGE
THIS BLIND CHILD LIKE FAITH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ZEPPELIN FACTORIES AT FRIEDRICHSHAFEN THE FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO PRODUCE TWO OF THESE VESSELS PER MONTH WHILE ANOTHER FACTORY OF A SIMILAR CAPACITY
EQUALLY BRILLIANT FEATS SINCE THAT DATE IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT EACH ASTOUNDING ACHIEVEMENT HAS BEEN ATTENDED BY AN EQUALLY STUPENDOUS ACCIDENT BUT THAT IS ACCEPTED AS A MERE INCIDENTAL DETAIL BY THE FAITHFUL TEUTONIC NATION
ALL OF WHICH HAVE PROVED THEIR SERVICEABILITY MORE OR LESS CONCLUSIVELY
HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW COLONELS OF THAT DAY WHO HAD ACTUALLY HELD A COLONEL'S COMMAND HAVING BEEN REGULARLY COMMISSIONED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS A COLONEL OF ARTILLERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HE MIGHT INDEED HAVE BEEN CALLED MAJOR GENERAL
HIS HANDSOME AND BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE SET OFF BY AN ABUNDANCE OF CURLY HAIR HIS LIBRARY HAD ABOUT THE ROUGHEST FURNITURE EVER SEEN IN AN APARTMENT CONTAINING SO MUCH THAT WAS VALUABLE AS I REMEMBER IT IT WAS A LONG LOW ROOM
IT COULD NOW BE MATCHED IN THE UNITED STATES HE LIVED TO SEE THIS RARITY COMMAND IN NEW YORK THE PRICE OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS HE WOULD SHOW YOU FORTY ONE WORKS IN THE ORIGINAL EDITIONS OF INCREASE AND COTTON MATHER
THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE HE POSSESSED A LARGE NUMBER OF BOOKS PRINTED AND BOUND BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HE HAD TWO HUNDRED VOLUMES OF THE RECORDS OF COLONIAL LEGISLATURES
HE WOULD SHOW YOU A COLLECTION OF MORE THAN THIRTY NINE THOUSAND PAMPHLETS OF WHICH EIGHT THOUSAND WERE PRINTED BEFORE THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HIS COLLECTION OF MAPS RELATING TO AMERICA WAS TRULY WONDERFUL BESIDES ALL THE EARLY ATLASES OF ANY NOTE
A PEN DRAWING OF DATE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE BY A BRITISH OFFICER UPON WHICH WAS WRITTEN PLAN OF THE REBEL WORKS AT WEST POINT HE HAD ALSO SEVERAL PLANS BY BRITISH OFFICERS OF THE REBEL WORKS AROUND BOSTON DURING THE REVOLUTION
THE WHOLE NUMBER OF VOLUMES IN THE LIBRARY WAS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE AND THE NUMBER OF PAMPHLETS NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND THE READER PERHAPS IMAGINES THAT THE COLLECTOR OF SUCH A LIBRARY MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY RICH MAN
AND THAT HE TRAVELED FAR AND WIDE IN SEARCH OF THESE PRECIOUS OBJECTS NOT AT ALL HE NEVER WAS A RICH MAN AND I BELIEVE HE RARELY TRAVELED BEYOND THE SIGHT OF THE DOME OF THE CAPITOL INDEED THE MOST WONDERFUL THING ABOUT HIS COLLECTION WAS THAT HE
AND HE OBTAINED MANY OF HIS MOST PRECIOUS RELICS BY MERELY TAKING THE TROUBLE TO CARRY THEM AWAY FROM THE GARRETS IN WHICH THEY WERE MOULDERING INTO DUST UNPRIZED AND UNKNOWN A WISE OLD NEW YORK MERCHANT LONG AGO HIMSELF MOULDERED INTO DUST
USED TO SAY MEN GENERALLY GET IN THIS WORLD EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT HOW CAN THAT BE ASKED A YOUNGSTER ONE DAY
I FOUND A LITTLE MORE MONEY IN MY PURSE THAN I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED I PUBLISHED A VOLUME OF HISTORICAL TRACTS IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THE OLD MAN RELATE HOW THIS TASTE FOR THE TREASURES OF HISTORY WAS FORMED IN HIS MIND HIS FATHER
WHICH HAS PROVED AN EXCELLENT SCHOOL TO MORE THAN ONE VALUABLE AMERICAN MIND HE BECAME AN ACCOMPLISHED PRINTER AND AT TWENTY TWO WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK TYPOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY AN ORGANIZATION WHICH STILL EXISTS
I DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR WORK SIR SAID THE SECRETARY IT IS OF NO USE TO ANYBODY I NEVER READ A PAGE OF IT AND NEVER EXPECT TO BUT SAID MISTER FORCE THE WORK IS PUBLISHED IN VIRTUE OF A CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT
IN THE SEVENTY EIGHTH YEAR OF HIS AGE ENJOYING ALMOST TO THE LAST TWO OF THE THINGS HE LOVED BEST HIS BOOKS
PUNCTUALLY AS THE SHRILL TONED BELL OF THE BLACK MARBLE STUDY CLOCK BEGAN TO CHIME NINE SIR PITT MADE HIS APPEARANCE FRESH NEAT SMUGLY SHAVED
WENT THROUGH THE COURT LAST WEEK AND WAS WHAT THEY CALL WHITEWASHED I BELIEVE LORD RAGLAND WOULD NOT PAY A SHILLING FOR HIM AND IT'S NOT MONEY I WANT RAWDON BROKE IN I'M NOT COME TO YOU ABOUT MYSELF
I WISH I WAS RAWDON REPLIED IF IT WASN'T FOR LITTLE RAWDON I'D HAVE CUT MY THROAT THIS MORNING AND THAT DAMNED VILLAIN'S TOO
TO GET ON WITH AS HE SPOKE
TO WRAP A BALL IN THE NOTE AND KILL STEYNE WITH IT AFTER THIS COLLOQUY THE BROTHERS ONCE MORE SHOOK HANDS AND PARTED
AND WAS WAITING FOR HER HUSBAND IN THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM WITH FEMALE INSTINCT AUGURING EVIL THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM HAPPENED TO BE LEFT OPEN AND THE LADY OF COURSE WAS ISSUING FROM IT
ANY EXPLANATION THE CHILDREN CAME UP TO SALUTE HIM AND HE KISSED THEM IN HIS USUAL FRIGID MANNER THE MOTHER TOOK BOTH OF THEM CLOSE TO HERSELF AND HELD A HAND OF EACH OF THEM
TO GO TO CHURCH THOUGH HER THOUGHTS HAD BEEN ENTIRELY ASTRAY DURING THE PERIOD OF FAMILY DEVOTION RAWDON CRAWLEY MEANWHILE HURRIED ON FROM GREAT GAUNT STREET AND KNOCKING AT THE GREAT
AND SAY THAT COLONEL CRAWLEY WOULD BE ALL DAY AFTER ONE O'CLOCK AT THE REGENT CLUB IN SAINT JAMES'S STREET NOT AT HOME THE FAT RED FACED MAN LOOKED AFTER HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT
WERE THRONGED WITH PEOPLE OUT UPON THEIR SUNDAY PLEASURE BUT THE COLONEL WAS MUCH TOO BUSY TO TAKE ANY HEED OF THESE PHENOMENA AND ARRIVING AT KNIGHTSBRIDGE
AND A NUMBER OF LADIES OF THE CORPS DE BALLET AND OLD MAC WHO WAS AT HOME WITH PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND RANKS AND CONSORTED WITH GENERALS DOG FANCIERS OPERA DANCERS BRUISERS
AND EVERY KIND OF PERSON IN A WORD WAS RESTING HIMSELF AFTER THE NIGHT'S LABOURS AND NOT BEING ON DUTY WAS IN BED HIS ROOM WAS HUNG ROUND WITH BOXING SPORTING AND DANCING PICTURES
I TOLD HIM HE WAS A LIAR AND A COWARD AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND THRASHED HIM SERVE HIM RIGHT MACMURDO SAID WHO IS IT RAWDON ANSWERED IT WAS LORD STEYNE
IT WAS DAMNED UNFRIENDLY MAC SAID RAWDON QUITE OVERCOME AND COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS HE GAVE WAY TO AN EMOTION THE SIGHT OF WHICH CAUSED THE TOUGH OLD CAMPAIGNER
SHE'S BEEN MAKING A PURSE FOR HERSELF ALL THE TIME AND GRUDGED ME A HUNDRED POUND TO GET ME OUT OF QUOD HE THEN FIERCELY AND INCOHERENTLY AND WITH AN AGITATION
THIS IS WHAT HE GAVE HER MAC AND SHE KEP IT UNKNOWN TO ME AND WITH THIS MONEY IN THE HOUSE SHE REFUSED TO STAND BY ME WHEN I WAS LOCKED UP
I SAY MAC IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG IF I DROP I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO TO GO AND SEE HIM YOU KNOW AND SAY THAT I WAS VERY FOND OF HIM AND THAT
SHE FOUND HERSELF SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY IN SNUG COMFORTABLE QUARTERS SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS KINDNESS AND GOOD NATURED SIMPLE PEOPLE
AND SAY HIS PRAYERS IN THE MOSQUES
AND AS SHE LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT OF NIGHTS IT NO LONGER REPROACHED HER PERHAPS SHE REPROACHED IT NOW WILLIAM WAS GONE EMMY WAS NOT VERY HAPPY AFTER HER HEROIC SACRIFICE
RUMMAGING HIS MOTHER'S DESK SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FOUND THE GLOVES NEATLY FOLDED UP
BUT THEY ATE THE DAINTIES WITH A WISE DISREGARD OF THEIR INEXPERIENCE AND ENJOYED THEM IMMENSELY THE OLD BUTLER WAS A GENERAL IN HIS WAY AND IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE STAFF OF SERVANTS AT ELMHURST
THE SILENT ATTENTION OF HER HEARERS PERMITTED HER TO BE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD SHE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS CAMPAIGN WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROMISED MORE BEAUTIFUL AND ATTRACTIVE HOUSES FOR THE FARMERS AND TOWNSMEN ALIKE
WE HAD ALL GROWN SO ACCUSTOMED TO ADVERTISING SIGNS SHE SAID THAT WE FAILED TO NOTICE HOW THICK THEY WERE BECOMING OR HOW BOLD AND OVERPOWERING FROM A FEW SCATTERED ANNOUNCEMENTS ON FENCE BOARDS
EVERY COUNTRY ROAD BECAME AN ADVERTISING AVENUE SCARCELY A COUNTRY HOUSE WAS FREE FROM SIGNS OF SOME SORT YET THE PEOPLE TAMELY SUBMITTED TO THIS IMPOSITION BECAUSE THEY KNEW NO WAY TO AVOID IT
SO WE GAVE THEM AN OBJECT LESSON WE PAINTED OUT ALL THE SIGNS IN THIS SECTION AT OUR OWN EXPENSE THAT YOU MIGHT SEE HOW MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL YOUR HOMES ARE WITHOUT THEM
UNTIL ADVERTISERS ARE FORCED TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES AND CIRCULARS THEIR ONLY LEGITIMATE CHANNELS THIS MUCH MISTER FORBES HAS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU AND HE WILL NOW TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IF HE IS ELECTED
HE PROPOSES TO DO KENNETH THEN TOOK THE PLATFORM AND WAS WELCOMED WITH A HEARTY CHEER HE MODESTLY ASSURED THEM THAT A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE COULD ACCOMPLISH MUCH GOOD FOR HIS DISTRICT
STANDING SHIELDED BEHIND THE HALF CLOSED BLIND OF AN UPPER WINDOW AND LISTENING TO AS WELL AS WATCHING THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW THE GIRL HAD BEEN LAUGHING AND TALKING WITH MISTER HOPKINS WHEN SHE FIRST SAW HER
IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE NEIGHBORING FARMERS AND THEY DROVE HOMEWARD IN THE LATE AFTERNOON FULL OF ENTHUSIASM OVER THE ROYAL MANNER IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ENTERTAINED AND ADMIRATION FOR THE GIRLS WHO HAD PROVIDED THE FUN AND FEASTING
AND THERE MAY BE A WAY TO CIRCUMVENT THIS UNSCRUPULOUS HOPKINS AND TURN THE INCIDENT TO OUR OWN ADVANTAGE LET'S THINK IT OVER CAREFULLY BEFORE WE ACT THERE'S ANOTHER THING SAID BETH SUPPORTING HER COUSIN
I'M INTERESTED IN THE MYSTERY SURROUNDING THE GIRL I NOW THINK I WAS WRONG IN SUSPECTING HER TO BE THE LOST LUCY ROGERS BUT THERE IS SURELY SOME ROMANCE CONNECTED WITH HER AND SHE IS NOT WHAT SHE SEEMS TO BE
THAT ISN'T IMPORTANT REPLIED LOUISE IT IS PROBABLY A MERE COINCIDENCE NONE OF US HAVE EVER SEEN THE REAL LUCY AND SHE MAY NOT RESEMBLE HER MOTHER AT ALL MISSUS ROGERS CLAIMS SHE DOES SAID BETH BUT ANYHOW
AT THE FAIRVIEW OPERA HOUSE ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO DEBATE THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ADVERTISING SIGNS BROUGHT GOOD OR EVIL TO THE COMMUNITY THE CAMPAIGN WAS NOW GETTING HOT
THAT HE WAS PERSONALLY LOST SIGHT OF ENTIRELY BY MISTER HOPKINS MISTER HOPKINS HAD THEREFORE BECOME SO ENRAGED THAT AGAINST THE ADVICE OF HIS FRIENDS HE ISSUED A CIRCULAR SNEERING AT WOMEN IN POLITICS
DID NOT LEAVE SOME OF HIS LITERATURE AT EVERY DWELLING IN THE DISTRICT HIS TIRADE AGAINST THE GIRLS WAS NEITHER CONVINCING NOR IN GOOD TASTE HE ASKED THE VOTERS IF THEY WERE WILLING TO SUBMIT TO PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT AND PERMIT A
BUT NO MAN OF SENSE WILL PERMIT A WOMAN TO INFLUENCE HIS VOTE IT IS A DISGRACE TO THIS DISTRICT THAT MISTER FORBES ALLOWS HIS GIRLISH CAMPAIGN TO BE RUN BY A LOT OF MISSES WHO SHOULD BE AT HOME DARNING STOCKINGS OR IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT
SHE PATTED JOYCE'S HAND THERE ARE SOME THINGS HOWEVER THAT PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW AND AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME YOU DESERVE TO I WAS MARRIED WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG GIRL
AND HAD ALWAYS RESENTED OPPOSITION AND I FELT SURE THAT HE WOULD SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHEN HE WAS OLDER I WISHED TO SEND HIM TO A SOUTHERN COLLEGE BUT HE BEGGED ME TO SEND HIM TO HARVARD
AND THE CONFEDERACY WAS DECLARED I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CORRESPOND WITH SOUTHERN AUTHORITIES TO ARRANGE ABOUT RAISING A COMPANY FOR FAIRFAX I NEVER DOUBTED THAT HE WOULD COMPLY WITH MY WISHES BUT
I LITTLE KNEW HIM I HARDLY NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE AWFUL DAY THAT HE CAME HOME YOU ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY OF IT THAT AFTERNOON SHORTLY AFTER HE ARRIVED
HEAVEN FORGIVE ME I WOULD NOT SO HE MUST HAVE LEFT ME THAT NOTE SHE COVERED HER EYES WITH HER HAND A MOMENT THEN SHE WENT ON
I GUESS I'D BETTER GO SAID JOYCE SOME ONE MAY HAVE SEEN THE LITTLE BOARDED UP DOOR OPEN DID YOU LEAVE IT OPEN SHE ASKED TURNING TO MISSUS COLLINGWOOD I THINK I DID
OH ER I SEE THE FACT IS THE STRANGER WENT ON I WAS PASSING HERE AND NOTICED THIS OUTER DOOR OPEN WHICH SEEMED A LITTLE QUEER I USED TO KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE VERY WELL INDEED
YET HOW WAS SHE TO COMPLY WITH IT CONSIDERING THE PRESENCE OF MISSUS COLLINGWOOD AND THE ALMOST UNEXPLAINABLE POSITION OF HERSELF AND CYNTHIA WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF IT ALL WHILE SHE WAS HESITATING AN IDEA CAME TO HER
BUT WE MUST NOT BE INHOSPITABLE MISS CYNTHIA AND I WILL GO AND SIT IN THE LIBRARY AND YOU CAN BRING HIM INTO THE DRAWING ROOM A FEW MOMENTS THERE IS NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSE THAT CAN VERY WELL BE SHOWN
WHO WHO ARE YOU SHE DEMANDED IN A VOICE SCARCELY LOUDER THAN A WHISPER THE STRANGER GAZED AT HER WITH A FIXED LOOK ARTHUR
ARTHUR CALTHORPE HE FALTERED NO YOU ARE NOT THEY DREW TOWARD EACH OTHER UNCONSCIOUSLY AS THOUGH MOVING IN A DREAM NO ONE
AS IF THERE WAS ANGER IN THE SKY IT IS BUT AN ACCIDENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE PORTENT OF AN APPROACHING STORM
THIS IS THE ONLY CHANGE OBSERVABLE THE JUDGE IS THE SAME THE JURY THE SAME AND THE SPECTATORS AS BEFORE THOUGH WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS IN REGARD TO THE CRIMINALITY OF THE ACCUSED
THERE IS BUT ONE MISSING LINK IF LINK IT MAY BE CALLED THE MOTIVE THE MOTIVE BOTH FOR THE MURDER AND THE MUTILATION
AND HE HAS BEEN CONDEMNED THE TRIAL HAS COME TO A CLOSE THE VERDICT GUILTY HAS BEEN GIVEN AND THE JUDGE LAYING ASIDE HIS PANAMA HAT IS ABOUT TO PUT ON THE BLACK CAP
THE JURY HAS GIVEN A JUST VERDICT I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE FORFEITED MY LIFE AND DESERVE TO LOSE IT
AFTER WHAT I'VE CONFESSED IT WOULD BE FOLLY IN ME TO EXPECT PARDON AND I DON'T I'VE BEEN A BAD FELLOW AND NO DOUBT HAVE DONE ENOUGH TO DESERVE MY FATE BUT BAD AS I MAY HAVE BEEN
YOU WONDER AT THAT IT'S EASILY EXPLAINED I KILLED HIM BY MISTAKE THE SURPRISE CULMINATES IN A SHOUT SUPPRESSED AS THE SPEAKER PROCEEDS YES BY MISTAKE
YOU SEE ME STANDING ON MY GRAVE
TILL I'VE SENT HIM TO HIS I DON'T BY GOD THERE IS NO NEED TO GUESS AT THE MEANING OF THIS PROFANE SPEECH THE LAST OF CALHOUN'S LIFE ITS MEANING IS MADE CLEAR BY THE ACT THAT ACCOMPANIES IT
UNIVERSAL AND IRRESISTIBLE TELLING US THAT FATHER MOTHER SISTER AND BROTHER ARE ALL TO BE FORSAKEN FOR THAT LOVE ILLIMITABLE
FOR AFTER CALHOUN'S DEATH IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE EX CAPTAIN HAD ONCE BEEN A BENEDICT AND THERE WAS A YOUNG SCION OF HIS STOCK LIVING IN NEW ORLEANS WHO HAD THE LEGAL RIGHT TO SAY HE WAS HIS SON
NOT YET DEAD THOUGH THE BLOOD STREAMING FROM A WOUND IN HER BARED BOSOM SHOWED SHE HAD NOT LONG TO LIVE TO THE QUESTION WHO HAS DONE THIS SHE WAS ONLY ABLE TO ANSWER DIAZ
COVARUBIO DE LOS LLANOS AS THE SPIRIT OF THE UNHAPPY SENORITA PASSED INTO ETERNITY
SHE JOYED TO SEE THE LATTER LED BACK AT THE END OF A LAZO HELD IN THE HAND OF HER HUSBAND AND REFUSED TO INTERFERE WHEN A BAND OF REGULATORS CALLED HASTILY TOGETHER
AND WHAT A POOR COMPENSATION IT SEEMED TO THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN EXACTING IT AS THEY STOOD GAZING UPON THE REMAINS OF THE VILLAIN AND HIS VICTIM THE SWARTH RUFFIAN DANGLING FROM THE BRANCH ABOVE
A SADNESS INDEPENDENT OF THAT CAUSED BY THE SPECTACLE OF A MURDER IT WAS REGRET AT HAVING SO HASTILY DESPATCHED THE ASSASSIN BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN DEATH WAS ISIDORA SUCH FEATURES AS SHE POSSESSED
YOU WOULD BECOME THE RECIPIENT OF A HOSPITALITY UNEQUALLED IN EUROPEAN LANDS YOU WOULD HAVE FOR YOUR HOST ONE OF THE HANDSOMEST MEN IN TEXAS FOR YOUR HOSTESS ONE OF ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
AND AFTER HAVING THE RIBBONS DEFTLY DELIVERED INTO HIS HANDS SINCE WE LAST SAW HIM THE GAY PLUTO HAS BECOME TAMED DOWN TO A STAID AND SOBER BENEDICT BLACK THOUGH HE BE
THE VERY FAIR WAGON ROAD THE MAUMEE RIVER WINDING THROUGH ITS SPLENDID RICH VALLEY SEEMS TO POSSESS A PECULIAR BEAUTY ALL ITS OWN AND MY MIND UNBIDDEN MENTALLY COMPARES IT WITH OUR OLD FRIEND THE HUMBOLDT
AND SO IT CONTINUES WITH EVER VARYING EVER PLEASING BEAUTY TO ERIE AFTER WHICH THE HIGHWAY BECOMES HARDLY SO GOOD TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER ENTERING PENNSYLVANIA I MAKE MY EXIT ACROSS THE BOUNDARY
TURNING AS HE WENT TO LOOK BACK TOWARDS THE BED AND EVIDENTLY GOING WITH RELUCTANCE IS IT FEVER ASKED THE SICK MAN IN A FAINT BUT UNFALTERING ACCENT IT'S A KIND OF CEREBRAL CONGESTION A MATTER OF THEM MEMBRANES THAT'S OVER THE BRAIN
DON'T BE HASTY YOUR HONOR SAID BILLY SUBMISSIVELY AND DON'T BE UNJUST THE REALMS OF DISAZE IS LIKE AN UNKNOWN TRACT OF COUNTRY OR A COUNTRY THAT'S ONLY KNOWN A LITTLE JUST ROUND THE COAST AS IT MIGHT BE ONCE YE'RE BEYOND THAT
JUST AS HE MAY HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE BY OBSERVATION WHAT IS SICKNESS AFTER ALL BUT JUST ONE OF THE PHENOMENONS OF ALL ORGANIC AND INORGANIC MATTER A REGULAR SORT OF SHINDY IN A MAN'S INSIDE LIKE A THUNDERSTORM OR A HURRY CANE OUTSIDE
HE TURNED TO THE CORPORAL AND SAID LOOK TO HIM CRAGGS AND LET HIM HAVE HIS SUPPER AND WHEN HE HAS EATEN IT SEND HIM TO MY ROOM BILLY BOWED AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND FOLLOWED THE CORPORAL TO THE KITCHEN THAT'S MY LORD'S SON I SUPPOSE
WHICH IS AS MUCH AS TO SAY TO STORM THE SKIES OR LAY SIEGE TO THE MOON GIVE ME ONE OF THE LINE OR A HEAVY DRAGOON IT'S THE SAME TO ME AS THE POET SAYS AND A LOW MURMUR OF THE COMPANY SEEMED TO ACCORD APPROVAL TO THE SENTIMENT
BROKE IN CRAGGS I WAS BRIGADED WITH ARENTSCHILD'S HANOVERIANS IN SPAIN AND THEY USED TO SIT OUTSIDE THE TENTS EVERY EVENING AND SING BY JOVE HOW THEY DID SING ALL TOGETHER LIKE THE SWELL OF A CHURCH ORGAN YES YOU'RE RIGHT
IT IS BUT FAIR TO SAY THERE WAS NEITHER COMMENT NOR IMPATIENCE ON THE CONTRARY THEY SEEMED TO ACCEPT THESE CONVULSIVE THROES OF SOUND AS AN EARNEST OF THE GRAND FLOOD OF MELODY THAT WAS COMING
I HAVE IT NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HE SAID MAKING A LOW OBEISANCE TO THE COMPANY AND SO SAYING HE STRUCK UP A VERY POPULAR TUNE THE SAME TO WHICH A REVEREND DIVINE WROTE HIS WORDS OF
CHEAP PENKNIVES AND SCISSORS PENCIL CASES BODKINS AND THE LIKE AND I WANDERED ABOUT FOR WEEKS THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL THE LAKE COUNTRY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE
WHEN NOT A BREATH DISTURBS THE DEEP SERENE AND NOT A CLOUD O'ERCASTS THE SOLEMN SCENE AROUND HER THRONE THE VIVID PLANETS ROLL AND STARS UNNUMBERED GILD THE GLOWING POLE O'ER THE DARK TREES A YELLOWER VERDURE SHED
THERE'S BULLS IN THE ANCIENTS I LL POINT OUT A BULL IN ARISTOPHANES WHAT HAVE WE HERE SAID HE TURNING TO THE OTHERS A POOR CRAYTURE SAYS I LIKE GOLDSMITH'S CHEST OF DRAWERS
TWO GENTLEMEN WERE COMING TOWARDS HER ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WHOSE MINDS IT CHANCED WERE VERY BUSILY OCCUPIED BY HER AFFAIRS ONE OF THESE WAS HER FATHER WHO WAS LYING IN HIS BRASS BED IN HIS COMMODIOUS CABIN ON THE HOLLANDIA
HE WAS COMING NOW TO EUROPE FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF SEEING V V AND HAVING THINGS OUT WITH HER FULLY AND COMPLETELY BECAUSE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SHE MADE SUCH AN ENDLESS SERIES OF DELAYS IN COMING TO AMERICA
OLD GRAMMONT STARED AT HIS MEMORY OF THAT MOMENT FOR A WHILE THAT AFFAIR WAS ALL RIGHT QUITE ALL RIGHT OF COURSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND ALSO HAPPILY CASTON WAS AMONG THE DEAD
HIS PROTECTIVE DUTY TO THEM THESE COMPANIONS THESE SEYFFERT WOMEN AND SO FORTH WERE ALL VERY WELL IN THEIR WAY THERE WASN'T MUCH THEY KEPT FROM YOU IF YOU GOT THEM CORNERED AND ASKED THEM INTENTLY
DON'T I KNOW MY DEAR GIRL THAT YOU DON'T LOVE ME YET LET THAT BE AS YOU WISH I WANT NOTHING YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE ME NOTHING AT ALL ALL I ASK IS THE PRIVILEGE OF MAKING LIFE HAPPY
LOOKING OUT DREAMILY OVER BEAUTIFUL VIEWS THEY WOULD LUNCH IN SHAFTESBURY AND WALK ROUND IT THEN THEY WOULD GO IN THE AFTERNOON THROUGH THE PLEASANT WEST COUNTRY WHERE THE CELTS HAD PREVAILED AGAINST THE OLD FOLK OF THE STONEHENGE TEMPLE
THENCE THEY WOULD GO ON TO WELLS TO SEE YET ANOTHER GREAT CATHEDRAL AND TO DINE AND SLEEP GLASTONBURY ABBEY AND WELLS CATHEDRAL BROUGHT THE STORY OF EUROPE RIGHT UP TO REFORMATION TIMES THAT WILL BE A GOOD DAY FOR US
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING OF OUR OLD RIVER SEVERN WE WILL COME RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT IF WE GO THROUGH BRISTOL THERE WE SHALL HAVE A WHIFF OF AMERICA OUR NEW FIND FROM WHICH THE TOBACCO COMES
AND THE BALTIC NORTHMEN PAST THE EMPERORS AND THE CORINTHIAN COLUMNS THAT SMOTHERED LATIN EUROPE FOR YOU AND ME ANYHOW THIS IS OUR PAST THIS WAS OUR CHILDHOOD AND THIS IS OUR LAND
AND TELL THEM TO SEND THEIR INSTRUCTIONS TO WELLS
YOUR CO OPERATION YOUR PROGRAMMES YOUR INSTRUCTIONS IN AGREEMENT WITH MY SECRET WISHES AND MOST CHERISHED HOPES HAVE AT NO TIME FAILED TO ENLIGHTEN ME AND TO POINT OUT MY ROAD THIS MEMOIR ON PROPERTY
WHEN YOUR COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT THE COMPETITORS HAD ENUMERATED WITH EXACTNESS THE IMMEDIATE AND PARTICULAR CAUSES OF SUICIDE AS WELL AS THE MEANS OF PREVENTING EACH OF THEM BUT THAT FROM THIS ENUMERATION
CHRONICLED WITH MORE OR LESS SKILL NO POSITIVE INFORMATION HAD BEEN GAINED EITHER AS TO THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE EVIL OR AS TO ITS REMEDY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
THAT WITHOUT EQUALITY THIS INSTITUTION IS AN ANOMALY AND AN IMPOSSIBILITY THAT EQUALITY ALONE CAN REVIVE THIS ANCIENT AND MYSTERIOUS KEEPING OF THE SEVENTH DAY
CAN IT NOT RENDER IT EQUAL FOR ALL HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN IF THE LAW NO LONGER HEEDS THE AGE OF ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CAN IT NOT BY THE RIGHT OF HEREDITY
BUT I SHOULD BE UNJUST DID I NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THIS PRETENDED SCIENCE AND THE MEN WHO PRACTISE IT DEVOTED TO STUDIES BOTH LABORIOUS AND SEVERE
I HAVE TOO MUCH NEGLECTED FORM AND STYLE IN VAIN SHOULD I HAVE TRIED TO DO BETTER LITERARY HOPE AND FAITH I HAVE NONE
AND WHAT THEY OUGHT TO FEAR THE PEOPLE INCAPABLE AS YET OF SOUND JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM APPLAUD INDISCRIMINATELY THE MOST OPPOSITE IDEAS PROVIDED THAT IN THEM THEY GET A TASTE OF FLATTERY
PUBLISHED LAST JUNE BY THE TITULARY OF THE SUARD PENSION ENTITLED WHAT IS PROPERTY AND DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR TO THE ACADEMY HE IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE SOCIETY OWES IT TO JUSTICE
IN CASE HE SHOULD PUBLISH A SECOND EDITION OF HIS BOOK TO OMIT THE DEDICATION
I CAN ONLY BEG THE READER NOT TO MEASURE THE INTELLIGENCE OF MY COMPATRIOTS BY THAT OF OUR ACADEMY WHILE MY PATRONS IN THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES WERE FULMINATING ANATHEMAS AGAINST MY BROCHURE
I HASTEN TO THANK YOU FOR FORWARDING TO ME YOUR SECOND MEMOIR UPON PROPERTY I HAVE READ IT WITH ALL THE INTEREST THAT AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FIRST WOULD NATURALLY INSPIRE I AM VERY GLAD THAT YOU HAVE MODIFIED SOMEWHAT
YOU ARE TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ECONOMICAL AND ACADEMICAL PHRASEOLOGY TO PLAY WITH THE HARD WORDS OF REVOLUTIONS I BELIEVE THEN THAT YOU HAVE HANDLED PROPERTY
YOUR STYLE IS TOO LOFTY EVER TO BE OF SERVICE TO THE MADMEN WHO IN DISCUSSING THE GRAVEST QUESTIONS OF OUR SOCIAL ORDER USE PAVING STONES AS THEIR WEAPONS
WHO MIGHT DISCUSS THE QUESTION IN THE PRESENCE OF A STARVING AUDIENCE WE SHOULD HAVE PILLAGE FOR CONCLUSION AND PERORATION
I CALL PROPERTY
TO GAIN THE VICTORY FOR ONE'S CAUSE IT DOES NOT SUFFICE SIMPLY TO OVERTHROW A PRINCIPLE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHICH HAS THE INDISPUTABLE MERIT OF SYSTEMATICALLY RECAPITULATING OUR POLITICAL THEORIES
THE DISCOVERY OF A SYSTEM OF ABSOLUTE EQUALITY IN WHICH ALL EXISTING INSTITUTIONS SAVE PROPERTY OR THE SUM OF THE ABUSES OF PROPERTY
ONE HOT NIGHT IN HINDUSTAN A KING AND QUEEN LAY AWAKE IN THE PALACE IN THE MIDST OF THE CITY EVERY NOW AND THEN A FAINT AIR BLEW THROUGH THE LATTICE AND THEY HOPED THEY WERE GOING TO SLEEP BUT THEY NEVER DID PRESENTLY THEY BECAME MORE BROAD AWAKE THAN EVER
IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ANYTHING BUT A JACKAL ANSWERED THE QUEEN I SAY IT WAS A TIGER CRIED THE KING DON'T CONTRADICT ME NONSENSE SNAPPED THE QUEEN IT WAS A JACKAL AND THE DISPUTE WAXED SO WARM THAT THE KING SAID AT LAST VERY WELL
BUT HEARD NONE AFTER A WHILE SHE GREW NERVOUS FOR SHE WAS ALL ALONE AND PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE PALANQUIN AND LOOKED ABOUT HER DAY WAS JUST BREAKING AND BIRDS AND INSECTS WERE BEGINNING TO STIR
BUT ALTHOUGH THE QUEEN'S EYES WANDERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY HUMAN BEING THEN HER SPIRIT GAVE WAY AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY IT SO HAPPENED THAT CLOSE TO THE SPOT WHERE THE QUEEN'S PALANQUIN HAD BEEN SET DOWN THERE DWELT A MAN WHO HAD A TINY FARM IN THE MIDST OF THE FOREST
AND WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HER STORY THE FARMER CALLED HIS WIFE WHO LED HER TO THEIR HOUSE AND GAVE HER FOOD TO EAT AND A BED TO LIE ON AND IN THE FARM A FEW DAYS LATER A LITTLE PRINCE WAS BORN AND BY HIS MOTHER'S WISH NAMED AMEER ALI
YEARS PASSED WITHOUT A SIGN FROM THE KING HIS WIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR ALL HE SEEMED TO CARE THOUGH THE QUEEN STILL LIVED WITH THE FARMER AND THE LITTLE PRINCE HAD BY THIS TIME GROWN UP INTO A STRONG HANDSOME AND HEALTHY YOUTH OUT IN THE FOREST THEY SEEMED FAR FROM THE WORLD
AND AS THEY DREW NEAR IT AMEER ALI BEHELD IN THE DOORWAY THE LOVELIEST DAMSEL HIS EYES HAD EVER LOOKED ON AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER SHE DREW HER VEIL ABOUT HER AND STEPPED INTO THE HUT AND MUCH AS HE WISHED TO SEE HER AGAIN
BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE SENT ON SUCH AN ERRAND PARTICULARLY ON A NIGHT SO WILD WHEN EVIL SPIRITS AND WITCHES WERE SURE TO BE ABROAD INDEED SO FRIGHTENED WAS HE THAT THE KING WHO WAS VERY KIND HEARTED BADE ANOTHER TO GO IN HIS STEAD
BUT EACH ONE SHOWED THE SAME STRANGE FEAR THEN AMEER ALI STEPPED FORWARD THIS IS MY DUTY YOUR MAJESTY HE SAID I WILL GO THE KING NODDED AND OFF HE WENT THE NIGHT WAS AS DARK AS PITCH
AND AS THE STORM HAD BY THIS TIME PASSED OVER HE MADE HIS WAY BACK TO THE PALACE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS STORY HE TOOK THE ANKLET OUT OF HIS POCKET AND HANDED IT TO THE KING WHO LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WAS AMAZED AT THE GLORY OF THE JEWELS WHICH COMPOSED IT INDEED
THEN THERE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE HAD SEEN BEFORE WHOM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED IN A VOICE SO SOFT THAT HE LISTENED LIKE ONE STRUCK DUMB
AND NEVER RECOVERED HIS TEMPER UNTIL AFTER LUNCH SHE'S GOT ALL HER BEAUTY AT ONE END OF HER NOW IF SHE HAD A FEW OF THOSE FINE GEW GAWS ROUND HER NECK AND WRISTS SHE WOULD LOOK BETTER BUT NOW TO MY MIND
AMEER ALI BOWED LOW AND ANSWERED THAT HE HAD DONE AND WOULD DO THE KING ALL THE SERVICE THAT LAY IN HIS POWER SAVE ONLY THIS ONE THING THE KING WHO CONSIDERED HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND A PRIZE FOR ANY MAN FLEW INTO A PASSION AND THE PRINCESS WAS MORE FURIOUS STILL
TO MISTAKE THE HOWL OF A JACKAL FOR THE HUNTING CRY OF A TIGER THE KING TURNED FIRST RED AND THEN PALE THERE IS CONTINUED THE FARMER A ROYAL TIGER BRED IN THE FOREST WHO HAS THE FIRST AND ONLY TRUE CLAIM TO YOUR THRONE WHERE
THEN THE FARMER TOLD THE KING AND HIS MINISTERS HOW HE HAD RESCUED THE QUEEN AND BROUGHT UP AMEER ALI AND HE FETCHED THE OLD QUEEN HERSELF WHOM HE HAD LEFT OUTSIDE AT THE SIGHT OF HER THE KING WAS FILLED WITH SHAME AND SELF REPROACH AND WISHED HE COULD HAVE LIVED HIS LIFE OVER AGAIN
AND NOT HAVE MARRIED THE MOTHER OF THE PROUD PRINCESS WHO CAUSED HIM ENDLESS TROUBLE UNTIL HER DEATH MY DAY IS PAST SAID HE AND HE GAVE UP HIS CROWN TO HIS SON AMEER ALI WHO WENT ONCE MORE AND CALLED TO THE FOREST FAIRY TO PROVIDE HIM WITH A QUEEN TO SHARE HIS THRONE
HER HOME SUCCEEDED SO WELL THAT THREE YEARS AFTER ITS COMMENCEMENT MISS CAVELL STARTED ALSO A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES SHE WAS POPULAR EVERYWHERE IN THE BELGIAN CAPITAL
ANOTHER LAWYER WHO WAS A BELGIAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AND TOLD THE AMERICANS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST CAUSE FOR THEM TO WORRY AS MISS CAVELL WAS SURE TO RECEIVE ONLY JUST TREATMENT HE ALSO PROMISED TO LET THEM KNOW WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TO TAKE PLACE
AND WILLINGLY GAVE HER LIFE FOR HER COUNTRY HER WORDS RESEMBLED THOSE OF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE THAT HAVE BEEN QUOTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK DEATH SHE SAID WAS WELL KNOWN TO HER AND SHE HAD SEEN IT SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS NOT STRANGE OR FEARFUL TO HER
SHE WAS TRIED WITH GREAT HASTE AND WITH GREAT SECRECY AND AFTER THE TRIAL THE SENTENCE WAS CARRIED OUT FAR MORE SPEEDILY THAN USUAL MOREOVER THEY HAD DECEIVED MISTER WHITLOCK AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN LEGATION AND HAD DONE SO DELIBERATELY
THE TWO WERE ALONE IN THE GRASSY COURTYARD OF THE RUINED CASTLE THE REST OF THE PICNIC PARTY HAD WANDERED AWAY FROM THEM OR THEY FROM IT OUT OF THE GREEN GROWN MOUND OF FALLEN MASONRY BY THE CORNER OF THE CHAPEL A GREAT MAY BUSH GREW
AND IT FORBIDS A MAN WITH AN INCOME OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY A YEAR TO SPEAK OF LOVE TO A GIRL WHO IS RECKONED AN HEIRESS THERE ARE PLENTY WHO TRANSGRESS THE CODE BUT THEY ARE IN ALL THE OTHER STORIES
HE DIDN'T HE ACCEPTED IT WITH HIS ARMS ROUND HER AND HIS LIPS AGAINST THE FACE WHERE THE TEARS NOW RAN WARM AND SALT IT WAS ONE OF THE IMMORTAL MOMENTS THE PICTURE WAS CHARMING TOO
IT'S GOT TO BE BORNE I SUPPOSE HE SAID LIKE ALL THE REST OF IT SHE'S HAPPY ENOUGH I OUGHT TO BE GLAD ANYWAY I CAN'T STOP IT PERHAPS HE SWORE A LITTLE
AND THE LOVER WAS RECEIVED AS THOUGH THAT LETTER WERE A CHARM TO ENSURE SUCCESS A FAULTY OR AT LEAST A SLOW WORKING CHARM HOWEVER FOR THE FATHER DID NOT LIFT A BAG OF GOLD FROM HIS SAFE AND SAY TAKE HER TAKE THIS ALSO BE HAPPY
BUT AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS TOOTHACHE ALL THE SAME HE HAD ANOTHER CALLER THAT AFTERNOON HE WHOM WE KNOW AS THE ONLOOKER CAME TO THANK HIM FOR THE INFLUENCE THAT HAD GOT HIM THE APPOINTMENT AS DOCTOR TO THE INFLUENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY THE FATHER OPENED HIS HEART TO THE ONLOOKER
SHE SAID WHY YOU WANT ME MORE THAN EVER BUT I MAY DIE AT ANY MOMENT SO MAY I AND YOU MAY LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED I'LL TAKE MY CHANCE
WITH THE EYES OF HIS MEMORY ON THE WHITE FACE OF THE MAN HE HAD STABBED NOW THE LOVER AND THE ONLOOKER HAD EACH HIS OWN BURDEN TO BEAR AND THE LOVER'S WAS THE EASIER HE WORKED STILL THOUGH THERE WAS NOW NOTHING TO WORK FOR MORE
HE WORKED AS HE HAD NEVER WORKED IN HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IF HE DID NOT TAKE TO WORK HE SHOULD TAKE TO DRINK OR WORSE DEVILS AND HE SET HIS TEETH AND SWORE THAT HER LOVER SHOULD NOT BE DEGRADED HE KNEW THAT SHE LOVED HIM AND THERE WAS A KIND OF FIERCE PAIN PLEASURE
AND SOMETIMES THE DREAMS GOT OUT OF HAND AND CARRIED HIM A THOUSAND WORLDS FROM ALL THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM THEN HE HAD TO WAKE UP AND THAT WAS BAD BUT THE ONLOOKER WAS NO DREAMER AND HE SAW HER ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK
HIS SOUL WAS NAKED TO THE BITTER WIND OF THE ACTUAL AND THE DAYS WENT BY WENT BY AND EVERY DAY HE KNEW MORE AND MORE SURELY THAT HE HAD LIED AND THROWN AWAY HIS SOUL AND THAT THE WAGES OF SIN WERE DEATH AND NO OTHER THING WHATEVER
YE'LL MAK A FINE SOLDIER MY LAD I THINK NOT SAID THE LOVER AND HE WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE THIS TIME HE REELED LIKE A MAN TOO DRUNK TO CARE HOW DRUNK HE LOOKS HE DROVE IN CABS FROM HARLEY STREET TO WIMPOLE STREET
HE'S VERY VERY CLEVER MY CHILD
AND SHE LAID HER ARM ACROSS ANNIE'S LAP AS IF TO PREVENT HER JUMPING OUT OF THE PHAETON AS MISSUS WILMINGTON'S OLD FRIEND YOU WILL HAVE THE GREATEST INFLUENCE WITH HER BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I WISH TO INFLUENCE HER IN FAVOUR OF THE SUPPER AND DANCE I DON'T KNOW THAT I BELIEVE IN THEM SAID ANNIE
MISTER WILMINGTON AND MISSUS MUNGER ARE OLD FRIENDS THE YOUNG FELLOW BOWED SILENTLY AND ANNIE INSTANTLY TOOK A DISLIKE TO HIM HIS HEAVY JAW LONG EYES AND LOW FOREHEAD ALMOST HIDDEN UNDER A THICK BANG HE SAT DOWN CORNERWISE ON A CHAIR
WILL YOU JOIN US JACK NO I'M GOING TO THE OFFICE SAID THE NEPHEW BOWING HIMSELF OUT OF THE ROOM JACK'S LEARNING TO BE SUPERINTENDENT SAID MISSUS WILMINGTON LIFTING HER TEASING VOICE TO MAKE HIM HEAR HER IN THE HALL
AND MISSUS WILMINGTON PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE OPEN PARLOUR WINDOW HOW D'YE DO ANNIE SHE DRAWLED IN HER TENDER VOICE WON'T YOU COME IN YOU SEE I'M IN POSSESSION
OH POOR ANNIE LYRA BEGAN TO LAUGH WITH AGREEABLE INTELLIGENCE DO COME IN AND TELL ME ABOUT IT WHY IS THAT GIRL GOING TO TAKE PART IN THE THEATRICALS SHE DOESN'T CARE TO PLEASE ANY ONE DOES SHE
DO YOU MEAN IT LYRA DEMANDED ANNIE ARRESTED ON HER THRESHOLD BY THE CHARM OF THIS IMPROBABILITY WELL I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE OPPOSITES BUT UPON SECOND THOUGHTS YOU NEEDN'T COME IN ANNIE
WE'LL JUST GO ROUND THERE AND KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE I OUGHT TO SHOW OFF MY NEW PHAETON TO MISTER WILMINGTON FIRST OF ALL HE GAVE IT TO ME IT WOULD BE KIND OF CONJUGAL OR FILIAL OR SOMETHING
THE STRUCTURE TREMBLED WITH THE OPERATION OF ITS INDUSTRY AND AS THEY MOUNTED THE WOODEN STEPS TO THE OPEN OUTSIDE DOOR AN INNER DOOR SWUNG AJAR FOR A MOMENT AND LET OUT A ROAR MINGLED OF THE HUM AND WHIRL
AND STAYING HIMSELF WITH A SHAKING HAND UPON IT LYRA INTERRUPTED THEM WELL I THINK NOW THAT ANNIE IS HERE WE'D BETTER NOT LET HER GET AWAY WITHOUT SHOWING HER THE WORKS OH OH DECIDEDLY
I'LL GO WITH YOU WITH GREAT PLEASURE AH HE BUSTLED ABOUT PUTTING THE THINGS TOGETHER ON HIS TABLE AND THEN REACHING FOR THE PANAMA HAT ON A HOOK BEHIND IT THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN HIS EAGERNESS TO DO WHAT LYRA BADE HIM
FROM TIME TO TIME AT LYRA'S BIDDING THE YOUNG FELLOW EXPLAINED TO ANNIE SOME CURIOUS FEATURE OF THE PROCESSES
THE PLANT CAN BEST BE SET UP WHERE THERE IS NO WINTER BESIDES THIS THE LOS ANGELES REGION HAS THE SEA THE MOUNTAINS THE DESERT AND MANY KINDS OF GROVE AND FIELD LANDSCAPE AND ARCHITECTURE ARE SUB TROPICAL
AS THEY SHOULD BE CALIFORNIA INDEED STANDS A CHANCE TO ACHIEVE THROUGH THE FILMS AN UTTERANCE OF HER OWN WILL THIS LAND FURTHEST WEST BE THE FIRST TO CAPTURE THE INNER SPIRIT OF THIS NEWEST AND MOST CURIOUS OF THE ARTS
THE HUE OF THE GOLDEN GATE THAT OPENS THE SUNSET WAY TO MYSTIC AND TERRIBLE CATHAY AND HINDUSTAN THE ENEMY OF CALIFORNIA SAYS THE STATE IS MAGNIFICENT BUT THIN
WHEN THE CALIFORNIAN RELEGATES THE DRAMATIC TO SECONDARY SCENES BOTH IN HIS LIFE AND HIS PHOTOPLAY AND TURNS TO THE GENUINELY EPIC AND LYRIC
THROUGH ALL FOUR SEASONS FAIRY BEAUTY OVERWHELMS THE LUMBERING GRAND STAND PLAYERS THE TINIEST GARDEN IS A JEWELLED PATHWAY OF WONDER BUT THE CALIFORNIAN CANNOT SHOUT
IF CALIFORNIA HAS A SHINING SOUL AND NOT MERELY A GOLDEN BODY LET HER FORGET HER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MELODRAMATICS AND TURN TO HER POETS WHO UNDERSTAND THE HEART UNDERNEATH THE GLORY EDWIN MARKHAM
THE DEAN OF AMERICAN SINGERS CLARK ASHTON SMITH THE YOUNG STAR TREADER GEORGE STERLING THAT SON OF ANCIENT MERLIN HAVE IN THEIR SONGS THE SEEDS OF BETTER SCENARIOS THAN CALIFORNIA HAS SENT US
A BROAD AND ORIGINAL THINKER AS YOU ARE THOUGHT IS ONE MATTER RASH INCONSIDERATE ACTION QUITE ANOTHER AND ABOVE ALL IF I SPEND ANOTHER DAY IN OR NEAR THE COMPANY OF MISS
DON'T YOU THINK SAID SIR RICHMOND THAT YOU ARE ATTACHING RATHER TOO MUCH WHAT SHALL I SAY ROMANTIC FLIRTATIOUS MEANING TO THIS AFFAIR
I SHALL BE SORRY ALL THE SAME I COULD HAVE WISHED SAID THE DOCTOR THAT THESE LADIES HAD HAPPENED A LITTLE LATER THE MATTER WAS SETTLED NOTHING MORE OF A PRACTICAL NATURE REMAINED TO BE SAID
BUT NEITHER GENTLEMAN WISHED TO BREAK OFF WITH A HARSH AND BARE DECISION WHEN THE NEW AGE IS HERE SAID SIR RICHMOND THEN SURELY A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO THE THE INCONVENIENCES YOUR PRESENT CODE WOULD SET ABOUT IT
PROBABLY BORED HER MORE THAN SHE REALIZED TO ANYONE TOO INTELLIGENT TO BE STEADILY EXCITED BY BUYING THINGS AND WEARING THINGS AND DANCING AND PLAYING GAMES AND GOING TO PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT AND BEING GIVEN FLOWERS SWEETS JEWELLERY
THAT I THINK IS WHY HISTORY HAS BECOME REAL TO HER WHICH SO ATTRACTS YOU IN HER HISTORY FOR HER HAS CEASED TO BE A FABRIC OF PICTURESQUE INCIDENTS IT IS THE STUDY OF A TRAGIC STRUGGLE THAT STILL GOES ON
GROTESQUELY HAPPEN HE SAID SHE KNOWS NOTHING OF MARTIN LEEDS YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT AND THEN HE ADDED IF SHE AND YOU FALL IN LOVE
THEY HAD SMOOTHED OVER THE EXTREME HARSHNESS OF THEIR SEPARATION AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE MORE TO BE SAID WELL SAID SIR RICHMOND IN CONCLUSION I AM VERY SORRY INDEED MARTINEAU
AND SHE REPEATED NO REMEMBERED COMMENTS AND PROPHETS OF HER CONTEMPORARIES ABOUT HERSELF SHE EITHER CONCEALED OR SHE HAD LOST ANY GREAT INTEREST IN HER OWN PERSONALITY
SIR RICHMOND AND MISS GRAMMONT HAD WALKED ROUND THE OLD CIRCUMVALLATION TOGETHER BUT BELINDA SEYFFERT HAD STRAYED AWAY FROM THEM PROFESSING AN INTEREST IN FLOWERS
THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO TAKE THIS CONFUSED OLD WORLD AND RESHAPE IT SET IT MARCHING TOWARDS THAT NEW WORLD OF YOURS OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FULLY DEVELOPED BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPY PEOPLE WHY NOT
A DISCIPLINED MANKIND GOING ON TO GREATER THINGS DON'T YOU NOW YOU TELL ME OF IT SHE SAID WITH A SMILE I DO BUT BEFORE NO YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR IT WASN'T CLEAR BEFORE
THE ADOLESCENCE SO TO SPEAK OF MANKIND IT IS AN IDEA THAT SEIZES THE IMAGINATION THERE IS A FLOW OF NEW IDEAS ABROAD HE THINKS WIDENING REALIZATIONS UNPRECEDENTED HOPES AND FEARS
THEY HAD GONE ON TO TALK OF HER FATHER AND OF THE TYPES OF MEN WHO CONTROLLED INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SHE HAD HAD PLENTIFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OBSERVATION IN THEIR HOMES AND HER OWN
HE FELT THAT THIS TIME AT ANY RATE HE WAS NOT BEING DECEIVED BY THE OUTWARD SHOWS OF A CHARMING HUMAN BEING THIS YOUNG WOMAN HAD REAL FIRMNESS OF CHARACTER TO BACK UP HER FREE AND INDEPENDENT JUDGMENTS
BUT PASSION WAS A THING MEN AND WOMEN FELL BACK UPON WHEN THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE IN COMMON WHEN THEY THOUGHT IN THE PLEASANTEST HARMONY AND EVERY REMARK SEEMED TO WEAVE A FRESH THREAD OF COMMON INTEREST THEN IT WASN'T SO NECESSARY IT MIGHT HAPPEN
SHE WOULD SOME DAY SHE LAUGHED BE SWIMMING IN OIL AND SUCH LIKE PROPERTY HER INTEREST IN SIR RICHMOND'S SCHEMES FOR A SCIENTIFIC WORLD MANAGEMENT OF FUEL WAS THEREFORE SHE REALIZED A VERY DIRECT ONE BUT IT WAS REMARKABLE TO FIND A YOUNG WOMAN SEEING IT LIKE THAT
AND THE IDEA OF A MATRIMONIAL ALLIANCE WITH GUNTER LAKE GUNTER LAKE SIR RICHMOND GATHERED WASN'T HALF A BAD FELLOW GENERALLY IT WOULD SEEM MISS GRAMMONT LIKED HIM AND SHE HAD A WAY OF SPEAKING ABOUT HIM THAT SUGGESTED THAT IN SOME WAY
AN IMMENSE ORGANIZATION OF MATURE COMMONSENSE HEALTHY AND SECURE GATHERING KNOWLEDGE AND POWER FOR CREATIVE ADVENTURES AS YET BEYOND DREAMING
AND REPLACEABLE STRUCTURES INDEED BOTH THESE TWO PEOPLE FOUND THEMSELVES THINKING IN THIS FASHION WITH AN UNWONTED COURAGE AND FREEDOM BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE HAD BEEN DISPOSED TO THINK IN THIS FASHION BEFORE
WHILE UPON THE TESSELATED PAVEMENT BEFORE THE DAIS PURPLE GRAPES AND YELLOW ROSES HAVE BEEN STREWN THE BLACK HAIR OF THE DAUGHTER OF PERSEIS FALLS IN PROFUSION ABOUT HER BARE SHOULDERS AND STRAYS OVER HER BREAST
IN ILLUSTRATING MY ARTICLES AND STORIES IN VARIOUS MAGAZINES HE IS A POPULAR PAINTER AND AS HANDSOME A MAN AS EVER HAD A PICTURE ON THE LINE THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE PROLOGUE OF THIS SECRET DRAMA WAS ENACTED
AND PLACED IT UPON THE BLOTTING PAD BEFORE ME THE GIRL HE LOVED BAH I KNEW HER THOUGH I DID NOT TELL HIM SO SHE WAS A DARK HAIRED PINK AND WHITE BEAUTY THAT FLITTED THROUGH ARTISTIC BOHEMIA LIKE A BUTTERFLY IN A HOTHOUSE
AND SHE A THIRD RATE ACTRESS WHO HAD AN INGENUE PART AT A STRAND THEATRE
HEEDLESS OF EVERYTHING UNDER THE SPELL SHE HAD CAST ABOUT HIM ONE NIGHT NOT LONG AFTER I HAD EXPRESSED MY SENTIMENTS TO HIM REGARDING HIS INFATUATION I ENTERED HIS STUDIO AND FOUND HIS GODDESS SEATED BY THE FIRE WITH HER SHAPELY FEET UPON THE FENDER
AND HOLDING A LIGHTED CIGARETTE BETWEEN HER DAINTY FINGERS DICK FLUNG DOWN HIS PALETTE AND CAME FORWARD TO INTRODUCE ME HER DARK EYES MET MINE AND WE TACITLY AGREED NOT TO RECOGNISE EACH OTHER THEREFORE WE BOWED AS PERFECT STRANGERS
YOU SET YOUR FACE AGAINST ALL THE FAIR ONES BUT I SUCCEEDED IN TURNING THE CONVERSATION INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
AS SHE GRASPED MY HAND AND LOOKED STEADILY INTO MY EYES NO I SAID STERNLY LAST NIGHT I TOLD YOU THAT A WOMAN HAD EMBITTERED MY LIFE THE WOMAN I REFERRED TO WAS YOURSELF AH
I WILL BE TRUE TO HIM IF HE MARRIES ME HE SHALL NEVER HAVE CAUSE FOR REGRET NEVER SUPPOSE I TOLD HIM WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF YOU YOU WILL NOT SHE CRIED CLINGING TO ME YOU ARE TOO HONOURABLE FOR THAT
THE WOMAN WHO BROKE MEN'S HEARTS I REPLIED MISCHIEVOUSLY EXCELLENT I SHALL BE ABLE TO ASSUME THAT CHARACTER WELL SHE SAID WITH A GRIM SMILE I WILL TELL HIM SPRING CAME AND WENT
PRESENTLY SHE REAPPEARED AND WE WENT TO DINE TOGETHER AT A RESTAURANT IN PICCADILLY AFTERWARDS VISITING A THEATRE AND SPENDING A VERY PLEASANT EVENING POOR DICK I WAS SORRY THAT HE WAS SO INFATUATED
I RETURNED HOME FROM A STROLL ACROSS KENSINGTON GARDENS
HEARD SOME ONE PLAYING UPON MY PIANO AND A SWEET SOPRANO VOICE SINGING TROTERE'S IN OLD MADRID I RECOGNISED THE CLEAR TONES AS THOSE OF ETHEL AH HAROLD SHE CRIED JUMPING UP AS I ENTERED THE ROOM
HAS NO SUCH ORDEAL TO FACE HE NEVER READS HIS NEW ROMANCE TO HIS FRIENDS NOR DO HIS WELL WISHERS APPLAUD IN ADVANCE REVIEWERS HAVE FIRST TILT AT ADVANCE COPIES AND VERY PROPERLY
ON THIS OCCASION AS ON PREVIOUS ONES I ASSISTED DICK TO RECEIVE HIS VISITORS BUT UNFORTUNATELY ETHEL HAD BEEN TAKEN SUDDENLY UNWELL AND COULD NOT ATTEND MY ANTICIPATIONS PROVED CORRECT
THE OPINIONS OF CRITICS WHO DROPPED IN WERE UNANIMOUS THAT IT WAS THE ARTIST'S MASTERPIECE AND THAT THE EXPRESSION AND GENERAL CONCEPTION WERE MARVELLOUS A VERDICT ENDORSED BY GUSHING SOCIETY WOMEN BORED CLUB MEN AND THE INANE JEUNESSE DOREE
IN SURPRISE I GLANCED UP FROM MY WORK OF ROMANCE WEAVING ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND SAW DICK PALE AND AGITATED STANDING AT MY ELBOW THE LETTER HE PLACED BEFORE ME WAS IN A WOMAN'S HAND AND EMITTED THE FAINTEST BREATH OF VIOLETS
A GLANCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO RECOGNISE THAT THE SPRAWLY WRITING WAS ETHEL'S TAKING IT UP I EAGERLY READ THE FOLLOWING LINES IT CONTAINED DEAR DICK I REGRET TO TELL YOU THAT CIRCUMSTANCES PRECLUDE ME FROM EVER MEETING YOU AGAIN
AND SHE HAD HER FOOT UPON MY NECK BUT IT IS ALL OVER HE ADDED BITTERLY I SHALL THINK NO MORE OF HER THEN HE WISHED ME AN ABRUPT FAREWELL AND LEFT
AND DRAWN IT ACROSS THE FACE MAKING A GREAT UGLY DISFIGURING DAUB OVER THE FOREHEAD AND EYEBROWS UTTERLY RUINING THE FEATURES AND PRODUCING A CURIOUSLY FORBIDDING EFFECT THE COLOUR WAS NOT DRY
THE LIMIT FOR SENDING IN TO THE ACADEMY WAS APPROACHING BUT DICK DID NOT WRITE AND I COULD ONLY WONDER VAGUELY WHERE HE WAS WANDERING IT WAS A GREAT PITY I THOUGHT THAT SUCH A FINE WORK SHOULD NOT BE EXHIBITED
YET THE WILFUL OBLITERATION HAD UTTERLY SPOILED IT WHILE SITTING IN HIS STUDIO MUSING ONE DAY IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF THE FLAW UPON THE FOREHEAD COULD BE HIDDEN IT MIGHT AFTER ALL BE SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE
TAKING IT UP I EXAMINED IT MINUTELY IN THE LIGHT THE IDEA OF PLACING A HALF MASK UPON THE FACE SUGGESTED ITSELF AND WITHOUT DELAY I PROCEEDED TO CARRY IT INTO EFFECT
I SAW THAT HE WAS HAGGARD EYED AND WILD LOOKING FROM HIS CONVERSATION I KNEW THAT TIME HAD NOT HEALED THE WOUND IN HIS HEART I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO THANK YOU SUFFICIENTLY OLD CHAP FOR TOUCHING UP MY DAUB
ALWAYS HE REPLIED SHAKING HIS HEAD SORROWFULLY I I CANNOT FORGET DICK'S POPULARITY STEADILY INCREASED LUCRATIVE COMMISSIONS POURED IN UPON HIM AND HE SETTLED DOWN TO SUCH HARD
THE WELL KNOWN ANGLO ITALIAN MILLIONAIRE AND ART PATRON SAYING THAT HE DESIRED TO BUY IT AND ASKING HIM TO GO DOWN TO OXTED PARK HIS SEAT IN SURREY TO ARRANGE THE PRICE I AM GOING TO DAY HE SAID YOU MASKED HER
TO INQUIRE AFTER THE COUNTESS'S HEALTH THE FOOTMAN LOOKED PALE AND GRAVE WHEN I ASKED AFTER HER LADYSHIP I MUCH REGRET TO INFORM YOU SIR THAT MY MISTRESS IS DEAD HE SAID
AND COULD LIVE NO LONGER DICK RARELY SMILES AND IS INVARIABLY GLOOMY AND SAD POOR FELLOW THE COUNT IGNORANT OF THE TRUTH HAS HUNG HIS LATEST PURCHASE
TO HEAR THE THUNDER OF THEIR FALL ECHOING AMONG THE HILLS BUT THE NEXT TIME HE VENTURED ABOVE GROUND WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND EVERYTHING CHANGED THE DARK WOODS WERE HEWN DOWN
CAME THE MUSIC OF THE SHEPHERD'S PIPE THE STRANGENESS AND PLEASANTNESS OF THE SIGHT SO DELIGHTED THE GNOME THAT HE NEVER THOUGHT OF RESENTING THE INTRUSION OF THESE UNEXPECTED GUESTS WHO WITHOUT SAYING BY YOUR LEAVE OR WITH YOUR LEAVE
HE WAS INDEED GREATLY MINDED TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH THIS BEING CALLED MAN SO TAKING THE FORM OF AN OLD FIELD LABOURER HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF A FARMER UNDER HIS CARE ALL THE CROPS FLOURISHED EXCEEDINGLY
BUT THE MASTER PROVED TO BE WASTEFUL AND UNGRATEFUL AND RUBEZAHL SOON LEFT HIM AND WENT TO BE SHEPHERD TO HIS NEXT NEIGHBOUR
AND WHERE AMONG THE HILLS TO LOOK FOR ANY WHO STRAYED AWAY THAT THEY TOO PROSPERED UNDER HIS CARE AND NOT ONE WAS LOST OR TORN BY WOLVES BUT THIS NEW MASTER WAS A HARD MAN AND BEGRUDGED HIM HIS WELL EARNED WAGES
SO HE RAN AWAY AND WENT TO SERVE THE JUDGE HERE HE UPHELD THE LAW WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AND WAS A TERROR TO THIEVES AND EVILDOERS BUT THE JUDGE WAS A BAD MAN WHO TOOK BRIBES AND DESPISED THE LAW
THE FAIR MAIDEN WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF THE COUNTRY AND SHE OFTEN WANDERED IN THE FOREST WITH HER PLAY FELLOWS GATHERING THE WILD FLOWERS AND FRUITS TILL THE MIDDAY HEAT DROVE THE MERRY BAND TO THE SHADY LAWN
WEAVING HIS MAGIC SPELLS TILL SLOWLY ALL ABOUT HIM CHANGED AND WHEN THE MAIDENS RETURNED AT NOON TO THEIR FAVOURITE RESTING PLACE THEY STOOD LOST IN AMAZEMENT AND ALMOST FANCIED THAT THEY MUST BE DREAMING
AS THE WANDERING BREEZE SCATTERED IT DAISIES AND FORGET ME NOTS FRINGED ITS BRINK WHILE TALL HEDGES OF ROSES AND JASMINE RINGED IT ROUND MAKING THE SWEETEST AND DAINTIEST BOWER IMAGINABLE
BUT AT LENGTH CURIOSITY PREVAILED AND SHE AND HER COMPANIONS EXPLORED TO THEIR HEART'S CONTENT
WHICH CERTAINLY DID LOOK VERY INVITING AND THEY ALL WENT GAILY TO THIS NEW AMUSEMENT THE PRINCESS WAS READY FIRST BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE SLIPPED OVER THE RIM OF THE POOL WHEN DOWN DOWN DOWN SHE SANK
THE GLITTERING GROTTO DESCRIBED TO HIM BY THE MAIDENS HAD COMPLETELY VANISHED AND SO HAD THE MARBLE BATH THE BOWER OF JASMINE INSTEAD ALL WAS A TANGLE OF FLOWERS AS IT HAD BEEN OF OLD
ON THREE SIDES OF THE CASTLE LAY A LOVELY GARDEN WITH MASSES OF GAY SWEET FLOWERS AND VELVET LAWNS ALL COOL AND SHADY WHICH PLEASED THE EYE OF THE PRINCESS THE FRUIT TREES WERE HUNG WITH GOLDEN AND ROSY APPLES
AND NIGHTINGALES SANG IN EVERY BUSH AS THE GNOME AND THE PRINCESS WANDERED IN THE LEAFY ALLEYS SOMETIMES GAZING AT THE MOON SOMETIMES PAUSING TO GATHER THE RAREST FLOWERS FOR HER ADORNMENT
BUT THE PRINCESS FELT NO SUCH HAPPINESS IN SPITE OF ALL THE MAGIC DELIGHTS AROUND HER SHE WAS SAD THOUGH SHE TRIED TO SEEM CONTENT FOR FEAR OF DISPLEASING THE GNOME HOWEVER HE SOON PERCEIVED HER MELANCHOLY
AND IN A THOUSAND WAYS STROVE TO DISPEL THE CLOUD BUT IN VAIN AT LAST HE SAID TO HIMSELF MEN ARE SOCIABLE CREATURES LIKE BEES OR ANTS
TAKE THIS LITTLE MANY COLOURED WAND AND WITH A TOUCH GIVE TO EACH ROOT THE FORM YOU DESIRE TO SEE WITH THIS HE LEFT HER AND THE PRINCESS WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S DELAY OPENED THE BASKET
AND GATHERED THE GOLDEN APPLES FROM THE TREES AND WHEN THEY WERE TIRED OF THIS AMUSEMENT THE PRINCESS LED HER FRIEND THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL ROOMS OF THE PALACE UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE ONE IN WHICH WERE KEPT ALL THE MARVELLOUS DRESSES AND ORNAMENTS
THE GNOME WHO HAD SECRETLY BEEN KEEPING AN EYE UPON THEM WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING SO WELL UNDERSTOOD THE HEART OF A WOMAN AND THE PRINCESS SEEMED TO HIM EVEN MORE CHARMING THAN BEFORE
THEY PLAYED FROM MORNING TO NIGHT ONLY THE PRINCESS NOTICED THAT DAY BY DAY THE FRESH YOUNG FACES OF HER MAIDENS GREW PALE AND WAN AND THE MIRROR IN THE GREAT MARBLE HALL SHOWED HER THAT SHE ALONE STILL KEPT HER ROSY BLOOM
WHILE BRUNHILDA AND THE REST FADED VISIBLY THEY ASSURED HER THAT ALL WAS WELL WITH THEM BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY CONTINUED TO WASTE AWAY
SWEETEST AND FAIREST OF DAMSELS CRIED THE GNOME DO NOT BE ANGRY EVERYTHING THAT IS IN MY POWER I WILL DO BUT DO NOT ASK THE IMPOSSIBLE SO LONG AS THE SAP WAS FRESH IN THE ROOTS
AND YOU CAN SPEEDILY CALL UP AGAIN EVERY FORM YOU WISH TO SEE THE GREAT GREEN PATCH IN THE GARDEN WILL PROVE YOU WITH A MORE LIVELY COMPANY SO SAYING THE GNOME TOOK HIMSELF OFF
AND THE PRINCESS WITH HER MAGIC WAND TOUCHED THE WRINKLED OLD WOMEN AND LEFT THEM THE WITHERED ROOTS THEY REALLY WERE TO BE THROWN UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP AND WITH LIGHT FEET SKIPPED OFF ACROSS TO THE MEADOW
AND THE FIELDS ARE BARE AND DESOLATE FOR BELOW IN THE VALLEY WINTER REIGNS ONLY HERE IN YOUR PRESENCE SPRING IS HELD FAST AND WHEREVER YOUR FOOT IS SET THE GAY FLOWERS BLOOM HAVE PATIENCE FOR A LITTLE
AND THE SOCIETY OF MEN AND SPENT HIS DAYS IN THE WILD FORESTS ROAMING ABOUT AND CRYING HER NAME ALOUD TO THE TREES AND ROCKS MEANWHILE THE MAIDEN IN HER GORGEOUS PRISON SIGHED IN SECRET OVER HER GRIEF NOT WISHING TO AROUSE THE GNOME'S SUSPICIONS
CAUGHT HIM IN HER CRUEL BEAK AND BEFORE HE COULD SAY A WORD HE HAD DISAPPEARED DOWN HER THROAT THESE TWO UNLUCKY VENTURES DID NOT PREVENT THE PRINCESS FROM TRYING ONCE MORE
THIS TIME TO HIS GREAT ANNOYANCE THE NUMBER WAS DIFFERENT SO HE RECKONED THEM FOR THE THIRD TIME BUT NOW THE NUMBER WAS NOT THE SAME AS EITHER OF THE PREVIOUS ONES AND THIS WAS HARDLY TO BE WONDERED AT AS HIS MIND WAS FULL OF THE PRINCESS'S
BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS THEN HE HASTENED INTO THE PALACE AND RUSHED FROM ROOM TO ROOM PEERING INTO EVERY HOLE AND CORNER AND CALLING HER BY NAME BUT ONLY
WE ARE STILL LEFT IN THE DARK IT IS TRUE AS TO KEATS'S RACE AND DESCENT WHETHER KEATS'S FATHER CAME TO LONDON FROM CORNWALL OR NOT SIR SIDNEY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DECIDE ON
WITH HIS GENIUS BEFORE THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN WHEN HE MET FANNY BRAWNE FOR THE FIRST TIME NONE THE LESS HAD HE DIED BEFORE THAT DATE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED IN LITERATURE NOT AS A MARVELLOUS ORIGINAL ARTIST
BUT HE DOES NOT PERCEIVE THE REASONS THAT LED KEATS TO ALTER THIS IN THE VERSION HE PUBLISHED IN LEIGH HUNT'S INDICATOR TO AH WHAT CAN AIL THEE WRETCHED WIGHT AND SO ON
THAN IS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD HE DOES NOT OWE HIS IMMORTALITY TO HIS VIRILITY HOWEVER HE OWES IT TO HIS SERVITUDE TO GOLDEN IMAGES TO HIS CITIZENSHIP OF THE WORLD OF THE SENSES TO HIS BONDAGE TO PHYSICAL LOVE
HAD HE LIVED LONGER HE MIGHT HAVE INVADED OTHER WORLDS HIS RECASTING OF HYPERION OPENS WITH A CRY OF DISTRUST IN THE ARTIST WHO IS CONTENT TO LIVE IN THE LITTLE WORLD OF HIS ART
IT WILL BE BUT A SOUNDING FUNERAL SPEECH INSTEAD OF COMMUNION WITH A LOVELY AND BROKEN SPIRIT
I FELT TOO THAT MINE WAS NOT AN INTERESTING OR IN ANY WAY RESPECTABLE DISTRESS THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT TO ATTRACT SYMPATHY ADVICE
AND THE ANALYSING SPIRIT REMAINS WITHOUT ITS NATURAL COMPLEMENTS AND CORRECTIVES THE VERY EXCELLENCE OF ANALYSIS I ARGUED IS THAT IT TENDS TO WEAKEN AND UNDERMINE WHATEVER IS THE RESULT OF PREJUDICE
THAT IT ENABLES US MENTALLY TO SEPARATE IDEAS WHICH HAVE ONLY CASUALLY CLUNG TOGETHER AND NO ASSOCIATIONS WHATEVER COULD ULTIMATELY RESIST THIS DISSOLVING FORCE
TO SPEAK FAMILIARLY A MERE MATTER OF FEELING THEY ARE THEREFORE I THOUGHT FAVOURABLE TO PRUDENCE AND CLEAR SIGHTEDNESS BUT A PERPETUAL WORM AT THE ROOT BOTH OF THE PASSIONS AND OF THE VIRTUES
AND A RUDDER BUT NO SAIL WITHOUT ANY REAL DESIRE FOR THE ENDS WHICH I HAD BEEN SO CAREFULLY FITTED OUT TO WORK FOR NO DELIGHT IN VIRTUE OR THE GENERAL GOOD
AND THERE SEEMED NO POWER IN NATURE SUFFICIENT TO BEGIN THE FORMATION OF MY CHARACTER ANEW AND CREATE IN A MIND NOW IRRETRIEVABLY ANALYTIC
THE BUTCHER AND HOW HE WAS CAST INTO THE VAULT OF THE CURFEW TOWER TURNING OFF ON THE RIGHT THE EARL AND HIS COMPANION CONTINUED TO DESCEND THE HILL UNTIL THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE GARTER
THEY TELL ME MISTRESS ANNE BOLEYN IS COMING TO WINDSOR WITH THE KING AND THE KNIGHTS COMPANIONS TO MORROW IS IT SO ASKED THE HOST AGAIN FILLING THE HORN AND HANDING IT TO ANOTHER ATTENDANT
RULED THE LAND AND WHEN HIS ELDER SON PRINCE ARTHUR WAS ALIVE LIKEWISE IN THAT YEAR THE YOUNG PRINCE ESPOUSED CATHERINE OF ARRAGON OUR PRESENT QUEEN AND SOON AFTERWARDS DIED WHEREUPON THE OLD KING
NOT LIKING FOR HE LOVED HIS TREASURE BETTER THAN HIS OWN FLESH TO PART WITH HER DOWRY GAVE HER TO HIS SECOND SON HENRY OUR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN WHOM GOD PRESERVE
BUT HE IS APT TO GET QUARRELSOME OVER HIS CUPS WELL SAID HONEST BRYAN CRIED THE DUKE YOU HAVE ONE QUALITY OF A GOOD LANDLORD THAT OF A PEACEMAKER
AND KEEP YOUR MISCHIEVOUS TONGUE BETWEEN YOUR TEETH BESHREW ME IF I DRINK THE KING'S HEALTH OR THAT OF HIS MINION ANNE BOLEYN CRIED MARK BOLDLY BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I WILL DRINK
AND I PROMISE YOU I WILL SHOW THEM NO BETTER TREATMENT AWED BY MARK'S DETERMINED MANNER THE BYSTANDERS KEPT ALOOF I COMMAND YOU IN THE KING'S NAME TO SEIZE HIM ROARED SHOREDITCH IF HE OFFERS RESISTANCE HE WILL
HEED NOT WHAT THE VILLAIN SAYS MY GOOD FELLOW SAID THE DUKE OF SHOREDITCH YOU HAVE CAPTURED HIM BRAVELY AND I WILL TAKE CARE YOUR CONDUCT IS DULY REPORTED TO HIS MAJESTY TO THE CASTLE WITH HIM TO THE CASTLE
THE DURABILITY OF FRAGILE THINGS DESTINY SOMETIMES PROFFERS US A GLASS OF MADNESS TO DRINK A HAND IS THRUST OUT OF THE MIST AND SUDDENLY HANDS US THE MYSTERIOUS CUP IN WHICH IS CONTAINED THE LATENT INTOXICATION
GWYNPLAINE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM TO SEE WHO IT WAS WHO HAD BEEN ADDRESSED A SOUND MAY BE TOO SHARP TO BE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE EAR
AN EMOTION TOO ACUTE CONVEYS NO MEANING TO THE MIND THERE IS A LIMIT TO COMPREHENSION AS WELL AS TO HEARING THE WAPENTAKE AND THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM APPROACHED GWYNPLAINE AND TOOK HIM BY THE ARMS
HAS BEEN WICKEDLY DESERTED ON THE DESERT COAST OF PORTLAND WITH THE INTENTION OF ALLOWING HIM TO PERISH OF HUNGER OF COLD AND OF SOLITUDE A CHILD TEN YEARS OLD
AND DISFIGURED BY A FLEMING OF FLANDERS CALLED HARDQUANONNE WHO ALONE IS ACQUAINTED WITH THE SECRETS AND MODES OF TREATMENT OF DOCTOR CONQUEST THE CHILD WAS DESTINED BY US TO BE A LAUGHING MASK
IN THE HEBRIDES GAIZDORRA CAPTAIN
THE SHERIFF AFTER A PAUSE RESUMED
ADDED THE SHERIFF IS A LEGAL DOCUMENT BEARING THE MARK OF KING JAMES THE SECOND ON THE MARGIN OF THE DECLARATION AND IN THE SAME HANDWRITING THERE IS THIS NOTE
WHICH HAD BEEN USED TO CORK IT IT WAS IN THIS BOTTLE SAID THE SHERIFF THAT THE MEN ABOUT TO PERISH PLACED THE DECLARATION WHICH I HAVE JUST READ
FOR A SOB THE LAUGHED CEASED AND THE MAN LAY BACK HIS EYELIDS CLOSED THE SHERIFF WHO HAD ALLOWED THE PRISONER TO SPEAK RESUMED ALL WHICH IS PLACED ON RECORD
SINCE CONFIRMED BY YOUR RECOGNITION AND CONFESSION AND AFTER YOUR RENEWED AVOWAL YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE RELIEVED FROM THESE IRONS AND PLACED AT THE GOOD PLEASURE OF HER MAJESTY TO BE HUNG AS PLAGIARY
THE SHERIFF HOLDING IN HIS LEFT HAND THE NOSEGAY AND IN HIS RIGHT THE WHITE WAND PLACED HIMSELF OPPOSITE GWYNPLAINE WHO WAS STILL SEATED AND MADE HIM A LOW BOW THEN ASSUMING ANOTHER SOLEMN ATTITUDE
AND WITH AUTHORITY FROM THE LORD CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND
REGARD BEING HAD TO THE DOCUMENTS COMMUNICATED BY THE ADMIRALTY AFTER VERIFICATION OF ATTESTATIONS AND SIGNATURES AFTER DECLARATIONS READ AND HEARD AFTER CONFRONTATION MADE
THE MAN WAS FAT AND PURSY AND WORE A COURT WIG AND A TRAVELLING CLOAK HE WAS RATHER OLD THAN YOUNG AND VERY PRECISE HE SALUTED GWYNPLAINE WITH EASE AND RESPECT
SAID THE FAT MAN THAT I AM CALLED BARKILPHEDRO THAT I AM AN OFFICER OF THE ADMIRALTY THAT THIS WAIF THE FLASK OF HARDQUANONNE WAS FOUND ON THE BEACH AND WAS BROUGHT TO BE UNSEALED BY ME
A LEGISLATOR AND A JUDGE A SUPREME JUDGE A SOVEREIGN LEGISLATOR DRESSED IN PURPLE AND ERMINE EQUAL TO PRINCES LIKE UNTO EMPERORS THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR BROW THE CORONET OF A PEER
THE AUTHOR OF A MAXIM DELIGHTS IN OPPORTUNITIES TO WHICH IT MAY BE APPLIED HERE WAS A CASE OF THE RESTORATION OF A PEER SEARCH WAS MADE GWYNPLAINE BY THE INSCRIPTION OVER HIS DOOR
TO THOSE WHO HAVE STUDIED PATHOLOGICALLY THE CASES OF CAPRICE CALLED OUR GOOD WILL AND PLEASURE
HE HAD WE KNOW A GAY AND OPEN COUNTENANCE DIFFERING SO FAR FROM PHILIP PHILIP WAS SULLEN JAMES JOVIAL BOTH WERE EQUALLY FEROCIOUS
HIS CRIMES LAY LIGHT UPON HIS CONSCIENCE HE WAS A MONSTER BY THE GRACE OF GOD THEREFORE HE HAD NOTHING TO DISSIMULATE NOR TO EXTENUATE AND HIS ASSASSINATIONS WERE BY DIVINE RIGHT
TO SET THE SIGN MANUAL TO CRIMES IS RIGHT ROYAL EVERY DEED DONE IS A DRAFT DRAWN ON THE GREAT INVISIBLE PAYMASTER A BILL HAD JUST COME DUE WITH THE OMINOUS ENDORSEMENT
JUSSU REGIS QUEEN ANNE IN ONE PARTICULAR UNFEMININE SEEING THAT SHE COULD KEEP A SECRET DEMANDED A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT OF SO GRAVE A MATTER FROM THE LORD CHANCELLOR
WHOM THE QUEEN BELIEVED IN BECAUSE HE WAS SHORT SIGHTED LIKE HERSELF OR EVEN MORE SO HAD COMMITTED TO WRITING A MEMORANDUM COMMENCING THUS TWO BIRDS WERE SUBJECT TO SOLOMON A LAPWING THE HUDBUD
SECONDLY THERE IS A ROYAL RIGHT OF MUTILATION
IF A DROWNED MAN IS CAST UP BY THE WATER AND IS NOT DEAD IT IS AN ACT OF GOD READJUSTING ONE OF THE KING IF THE HEIR BE FOUND LET THE CORONET BE GIVEN BACK TO HIM
UNDER CONSTRAINT OF SUPERIOR POWER DOES NOT TARNISH THE BLAZON AS IN THE CASE OF ABDOLMUMEN WHO WAS A KING ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN A GARDENER THAT OF JOSEPH WHO WAS A SAINT ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN A CARPENTER
MISCALLED GWYNPLAINE ON THE SOLE CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD BE CONFRONTED WITH THE CRIMINAL HARDQUANONNE AND IDENTIFIED BY THE SAME AND ON THIS POINT THE CHANCELLOR AS CONSTITUTIONAL KEEPER OF THE ROYAL CONSCIENCE
THE IDENTITY OF THE FINAL VICTIM
HE WAS OFTEN AS ASTONISHED AT MY ACUMEN IN FOLLOWING A CLEW AS I WAS AT HIS MARVELOUS THEORIES
PERHAPS HIS CURIOUS POWER WAS NEVER MORE NOTICEABLE THAN IN THE CASE OF THE WITHAN MURDER A FARMER RETURNING FROM MEDWORTH THE NEIGHBORING MARKET TOWN ONE NIGHT IN JANUARY
NOR ANY PAPERS IN HIS POCKETS TO LEAD TO HIS IDENTIFICATION SO FAR AS COULD BE ASCERTAINED
SOME TWO YEARS AGO AN ALMOST IDENTICAL MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED OUTSIDE A VILLAGE IN NORMANDY IN THIS CASE ALSO THE HEAD WAS MISSING AND NOTHING HAD BEEN FOUND UPON THE BODY TO IDENTIFY THE VICTIM HE WAS WELL DRESSED AND A MAN WHO WOULD BE LIKELY TO CARRY PAPERS WITH HIM BUT NOTHING WAS FOUND
AND THE MURDER HAD REMAINED A MYSTERY THESE WERE THE POINTS KNOWN AND CONJECTURED WHEN THE CASE CAME INTO MY HANDS AND MY INVESTIGATIONS ADDED LITTLE TO THEM ONE POINT HOWEVER IMPRESSED ME I FELT CONVINCED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHES WHICH WERE SHOWN TO ME HAD NOT BEEN MADE IN ENGLAND
THEY WERE POOR WORN ALMOST THREADBARE BUT THEY HAD ONCE BEEN FAIRLY GOOD AND THE CUT WAS NOT ENGLISH THAT IT WAS FRENCH I COULD NOT POSSIBLY AFFIRM BUT IT MIGHT BE AND SO I FASHIONED A FRAGILE LINK WITH THE NORMANDY CRIME
ANY TRACES THAT THE HEAD WAS CARRIED TO THE WOOD THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES SAY YES AND NOT A TRACE AFTERWARD THE GROUND IN THE WOOD WAS SEARCHED AT THE TIME AND I HAVE BEEN OVER IT CAREFULLY SINCE THROUGH ONE PART OF THE WOOD THERE RUNS A DITCH
THE NEXT AFTERNOON HE ARRANGED A DRIVE I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO WITHAN BUT WE TURNED AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE AND PRESENTLY QUARLES STOPPED THE CARRIAGE
SHOULD WE MEET ANYONE BLAME ME SAY I AM A DODDERING OLD FOOL WHO WOULD WALK UNDER THE TREES
YOUR LIFE IS LIKELY TO DEPEND UPON IT AND KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN TO MAKE SURE NO ONE IS FOLLOWING US HE HAD BECOME KEEN LIKE A DOG ON THE TRAIL AND OLD AS HE WAS SEEMED INCAPABLE OF FATIGUE
ONCE OR TWICE THE PROFESSOR GAVE ME A WARNING GESTURE BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK HE HAD EVIDENTLY SOME DEFINITE GOAL AND I WAS CONSCIOUS OF EXCITEMENT AS I FOLLOWED HIM FOR AN HOUR OR MORE HE TURNED THIS WAY AND THAT EXPLORING EVERY LITTLE RAVINE HE COULD DISCOVER
AH THIS LOOKS PROMISING QUARLES SAID SUDDENLY IN A CORNER OF THE WALL OR TO BE MORE PRECISE FILLING UP A RENT IN IT WAS A SHED ROUGHLY BUILT BUT WITH A DOOR SECURED BY A VERY BUSINESS LIKE LOCK I THINK THE SHED IS CLIMBABLE
THE BACK PART BEING CLOSED IN THE ROOF WAS THATCHED WITH BARK AND DRIED BRACKEN AND AGAINST ONE END OF THE VERANDA WAS A NOTCHED TREE TRUNK SERVING AS A LADDER AS I EXPECTED SAID QUARLES WITH SOME EXCITEMENT WE MUST GET ONTO THE VERANDA FOR A MOMENT
THROWING THE CAVE PART OF THE PIT INTO GREATER SHADOW THAN EVER I CANNOT ATTEMPT TO SAY HOW LONG WE HAD WAITED IN UTTER SILENCE WHEN QUARLES TOUCHED MY ARM SOMEONE WAS COMING AND WITH NO PARTICULAR STEALTH
ONLY THE SMOKE CURLED ABOUT IT THEN THE MAN MOVED THE WOODEN BLOCK TO THE SIDE OF THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN FACING US THE FLICKERING FLAMES THROWING A RED GLOW OVER HIM WIGAN DO YOU SEE WHISPERED QUARLES NOT CLEARLY WE'LL GO NEARER CAREFULLY
FROM OUR NEW POINT OF VIEW I LOOKED AGAIN THE MAN'S FACE WAS FAMILIAR BUT JUST THEN I COULD NOT REMEMBER WHO HE WAS IT WAS THE BUNDLE HANGING OVER THE FIRE WHICH FASCINATED ME TIED TOGETHER AND SECURED IN A NETWORK OF STRING
WAS AMONG THOSE HANGING OVER THE FIRE SIR HENRY WAS FOR MANY YEARS IN BORNEO WIGAN AND FOR A LARGE PART OF THE TIME WAS UP COUNTRY HELPING TO PUT DOWN THE HEAD HUNTING WHICH STILL EXISTED THERE AND STILL DOES EXIST ACCORDING TO ALL ACCOUNTS WHEN THE NATIVES THINK THEY CAN ESCAPE DETECTION
THE HORRIBLE CUSTOM PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIS DISEASED BRAIN AND FASCINATED HIM YOU SEE HOW MY THEORY GREW THEN I LOOKED FOR THE ACTUAL PROOF WHICH WE FOUND LAST NIGHT
WAS INCLINED TO LAUGH AT MY QUESTION AND PROCEEDED TO INFORM ME THAT HE HAD NO FAMILY SKELETON
BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN POINTS AGAINST THIS IDEA NO ONE HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE NIGHT
THE SILVER ON THE FLOOR WAS SCATTERED
THE CIGARETTE ENDS THE DIRTY GLASSES AND THE BISCUIT CRUMBS SEEM TO ME RATHER GRATUITOUS DECEPTIONS AND WAIT SAID QUARLES YOU ASSUME A LITTLE TOO MUCH THEY WOULD HAVE DECEIVED NINE MEN OUT OF TEN YOU HAPPEN TO BE THE TENTH MAN
SIR JOSEPH'S STANDING IS VERY HIGH SUDDEN TEMPTATION OR NECESSITY MAY SUBVERT THE HIGHEST CHARACTER I ANSWERED
IT WAS SO NOW YOU DO NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN THE BROKEN BOX OF COUNTERS SHE SAID TURNING TOWARD HER GRANDFATHER I WONDER WIGAN IS THAT THE CLEW QUARLES SAID QUICKLY IT CREEPS INTO MY BRAIN THE COUNTERS WERE IN A HEAP I SAID
ASKED QUARLES NO THAT WOULD HAVE SCATTERED THEM MORE THEY WERE ROUND AND MIGHT HAVE FALLEN OVER AFTER HAVING BEEN PUT ONE UPON ANOTHER AS ONE GATHERS COPPERS TOGETHER WHEN COUNTING A NUMBER OF THEM SIR JOSEPH PICKED THEM UP
HE HAD SEVERAL CABINETS IN HIS ROOM CONTAINING SPECIMENS AND EVERYTHING HAD BEEN TURNED ON TO THE FLOOR AND DAMAGED MORE OR LESS IN FACT ALTHOUGH NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN THE DAMAGE WAS CONSIDERABLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE BURGLARY DOCTOR WOOD WAS AWAY FROM HOME
IF THE THIEF HAD NOT FOUND WHAT HE WANTED HE WOULD CONTINUE HIS SEARCH I ARGUED FOR SOME REASON HE CONNECTED SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD WITH THE OBJECT OF HIS SEARCH
WE WERE SOMEWHAT JADED BY THE TIME MONDAY MORNING CAME FOR SUNDAY BROUGHT NOT ONLY NO RELIEF BUT REPETITIONS OF MANY OF THE MOST HORRIBLE OF THESE TALES OF A WAYSIDE INN
IT WAS WITH NO SLIGHT SENSE OF RELIEF THAT WE PAID OUR MODEST BILL AND AT LAST BROKE AWAY FROM SUCH GHASTLY ASSOCIATIONS AN INVOLUNTARY SHUDDER OVERCAME ME AS WE PASSED THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND
AND DEEP CUTS THROUGH SUN BAKED MUDBANKS THE COLOR OF ADOBE BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE LOW GLOOMY BOTTOMS HEAVILY FORESTED AND STREWN WITH FLOOD WOOD WHILE BEYOND THE LAND RISES GRADUALLY INTO PRAIRIE STRETCHES
DUCKS ARE FREQUENTLY SEEN SAILING NEAR THE SHORES WHILE DIVERS SILENTLY DART AND PLUNGE AHEAD OF THE CANOE SAFELY OUT OF GUNSHOT REACH A HEAD WIND THIS MORNING MADE ROWING MORE DIFFICULT BY COUNTERACTING THE INFLUENCE OF THE CURRENT
NEAR THE SOUTH BANK THE FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN ENTIRELY SWEPT AWAY FOR A SPACE SEVERAL RODS IN WIDTH AND THROUGH THIS OPENING THE PENT UP CURRENT FIERCELY SWEEPS WE WENT THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE CHANNEL THUS MADE WITH A SWOOP
WAS WHITE CLOUD A SHREWD SINISTER SAVAGE HALF WINNEBAGO AND HALF SAC WHO CLAIMED TO BE A PROPHET HE WAS BLACK HAWK'S EVIL GENIUS DURING THE UPRISING OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO AND IN MANY WAYS
JUMPING ALONG AT A BREAKNECK SPEED AND WHEN WE FINALLY REJOINED THE MAIN RIVER BELOW WERE GRATEFUL ENOUGH FOR THE RUN HAD BEEN FILLED WITH CONTINUOUS POSSIBILITIES OF A DISASTROUS SMASH UP MILES AWAY FROM ANY HUMAN HABITATION
AND MADE FOR A THICK CLUMP OF TREES ON THE TOP OF AN ISLAND MUDBANK WHERE WE STOOD BUTTONED TO THE NECK IN RUBBER COATS A VIGOROUS HALLOO CAME SOUNDING OVER THE WATER LOOKING UP WE SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME A SMALL TENT ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE
AND SO AS TO BE CONVENIENT TO HIS LINES HE WAS CAMPING ON HIS OWN WOOD LOT THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME WAS SPENT IN FISHING OR HUNTING ACCORDING TO THE SEASON AND PEDDLING THE PRODUCT IN NEIGHBORING TOWNS
AND FIRMLY THOUGH WITH ADMIRABLE GOOD NATURE PERSISTED IN DEFENDING HIS ROVING TENDENCIES IN THE COURSE OF OUR CONVERSATION I LEARNED THAT THE FERRYMEN WHO ARE MORE NUMEROUS ON THE LOWER THAN ON THE UPPER ROCK PAY AN ANNUAL LICENSE FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS EACH
WHERE SMALL FIELDS ARE CULTIVATED BY THE POORER CLASS OF FARMERS WHO WERE LAST SPRING MUCH DAMAGED BY THE FLOOD WHICH SWEPT THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY THE FERRYMAN A GOOD NATURED YOUNG ATHLETE
AND SET OUT ALONG A DEVIOUS WAY THROUGH A DRIVING MIST WHICH BLACKENED THE TWILIGHT INTO DUSK TO FIND THIS PLACE OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT IT IS A LITTLE ONE STORY DILAPIDATED FARM HOUSE
AND CHEAP DECORATIONS PECULIAR IN THE COUNTRY TO ALL THREE CLASSES OF ROOMS THE EVIDENCES OF POVERTY SHIFTLESSNESS AND UNTASTEFUL PRETENTIOUSNESS UPON EVERY SIDE
WITH THE ODDEST COLLECTION OF CALICO AND GINGHAM GOWNS BUSTLES HOOPSKIRTS HATS BONNETS AND WINTER UNDERWEAR I THINK I HAD EVER LAID EYES ON MUCH OF THIS CONDITION OF AFFAIRS WAS NOT KNOWN HOWEVER UNTIL NEXT MORNING
WE HAD HARDLY RECOVERED FROM OUR ASTONISHMENT AT THUS BEING LOCKED INTO A DARK HOLE THE SIZE OF A FASHIONABLE LADY'S TRUNK AND WERE QUIETLY LAUGHING OVER THIS ODD ADVENTURE WHEN THE LANDLADY APPLIED HER MOUTH TO A CRACK AND SHOUTED AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE WAKED THE DEAD HI THERE
BY THE SIDE OF THE CLOCK GEMMEN HE INVARIABLY THUS ADDRESSED US AS THOUGH WE WERE A COTERIE OF CHECKER PLAYERS AT A VILLAGE GROCERY GEMMEN WHEN I SEEN HOW THEM JOHNNY REBS WAS A USIN OUR BOYS IN THEM PRISON PENS
NOW HE SAYS HOLD ON A MINUTE YOU DIDN'T HEV SHAKES AFORE THE WAR SAYS HE NOT AS MUCH I SAYS NOT KNOWIN WHAT THE FELLER WAS DRIVIN AT BUT SOME I WAS A KID THEN AND KIDS DON'T SHAKE MUCH SAYS I
WITH A BIG AMMERNITION WAGIN ON BEHIND
THIS SUDDEN REVELATION OF THE STRENGTH OF THE VETERAN'S CLAIM TO GLORY AND A PENSION PUT A DAMPER UPON HIS REMINISCENCES OF THE WAR AND GIVING THE INNOCENT SIMON A SAVAGE LEER
HE SOON CONTRIVED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION UPON HIS WONDERFUL EXPLOITS IN DUCK SHOOTING AND FISHING INDUSTRIES IN THE PURSUIT OF WHICH HE WITH SO MANY OF HIS FELLOW FARMERS ON THE BOTTOMS APPEARED TO BE MORE EAGER THAN IN TILLING THE SOIL
SOUR DOUGHY BREAD POTATOES WHICH IF BOILED ARE BUT HALF COOKED AND IF MASHED ARE FLOATED WITH ABOMINABLE BUTTER OR PASTEY FLOUR GRAVY SALT PORK EITHER SWIMMING IN A BOWL OF GREASE OR FRIED TO A LEATHERY CHIP
IT IS NO WONDER THAT COUNTRY BOYS DRIFT TO THE CITIES WHERE THEY CAN OBTAIN PROPERLY COOKED FOOD AND LIVE LIKE RATIONAL BEINGS THE RIVER CONTINUES TO WIDEN AS WE APPROACH THE JUNCTION WITH THE MISSISSIPPI THIRTY NINE MILES BELOW ERIE
OF BEING EITHER GROUNDED OR CAPSIZED NOW AND THEN THE BANKS BECOME FIRMER WITH CHARMING VISTAS OF HIGH WOODED HILLS COMING DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE BROAD SAVANNAS INTERVENE DECKED OUT WITH VARIEGATED FLORA
THE SPIDER WORT THE LITTLE BLUE LOBELIA AND THE CUP WEED THESE SAVANNAS ARE APPARENTLY OVERFLOWED IN TIMES OF EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH WATER
AND MILAN WAS FARTHER FROM ROCK ISLAND THAN EITHER CARBON CLIFF OR COLOMA WITH LESS FREQUENT RAILWAY SERVICE FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS WE DECIDED TO ACCEPT THIS ADVICE AND TO SHIP FROM COLOMA
HE WOULD NOT ADVERTISE IN PAPERS WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BY THEIR PUBLICATION OF OPINION ULTIMATELY HURT CAPITALISM AS A WHOLE STILL LESS IN THOSE WHOSE OPINIONS MIGHT AFFECT HIS OWN PRIVATE FORTUNE ADVERSELY STUPID LIKE ALL PEOPLE GIVEN UP TO GAIN
THE ADVERTISER CAME TO SEE THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY DICTATE POLICY AND OPINION AND THAT HE HAD ALSO ANOTHER MOST POWERFUL AND NOVEL WEAPON IN HIS HAND WHICH WAS THE SUPPRESSION OF NEWS
WE MUST NOT EXAGGERATE THIS ELEMENT FOR ONE THING THE POWER REPRESENTED BY THE GREAT CAPITALIST PRESS WAS A POWER EQUAL WITH THAT OF THE GREAT ADVERTISERS FOR ANOTHER THERE WAS NO CLEAR CUT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CAPITALISM THAT OWNED NEWSPAPERS AND THE CAPITALISM THAT ADVERTISED
THE SAME MAN WHO OWNED THE DAILY TIMES WAS A SHAREHOLDER IN JONES'S SOAP OR SMITH'S PILLS THE MAN WHO GAMBLED AND LOST ON THE HOWL WAS AT THE SAME TIME GAMBLING AND WINNING ON A BUCKET SHOP ADVERTISED IN THE HOWL
THREE IT IS ECONOMICALLY SUPPORTED BY ADVERTISERS WHO CAN IN PART CONTROL IT BUT THESE ARE OF THE SAME CAPITALIST KIND IN MOTIVE AND MANNER WITH THE OWNERS OF THE PAPERS THEIR POWER DOES NOT THEREFORE CLASH IN THE MAIN WITH THAT OF THE OWNERS
THE DIFFERENCE BEING PAID BY THE ADVERTISEMENT SUBSIDY
IT WAS UNDREAMT OF BUT A FEW YEARS AGO IT IS ALREADY TO DAY THE CAPITAL FACT OF OUR WHOLE POLITICAL SYSTEM A PRIME MINISTER IS MADE OR DEPOSED BY THE OWNER OF A GROUP OF NEWSPAPERS NOT BY POPULAR VOTE OR BY ANY OTHER FORM OF OPEN AUTHORITY
I SAY THAT THE FEW NEWSPAPER CONTROLLERS GOVERN AND GOVERN ABOMINABLY I AM RIGHT BUT THEY ONLY DO SO AS DO ALL NEW POWERS BY AT ONCE ALLIANCE WITH AND TREASON AGAINST THE OLD WITNESS HARMSWORTH AND THE POLITICIANS
AND RARE NEWSPAPERS TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AND THESE NEWSPAPERS CAME TO BE CALLED THE OFFICIAL PRESS IT WAS A CRUDE METHOD AND HAS BEEN LONG ABANDONED EVEN BY THE SIMPLER DESPOTIC FORMS OF GOVERNMENT NOTHING OF THAT KIND EXISTS NOW OF COURSE IN THE DEEPER CORRUPTION OF MODERN EUROPE
THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT WHERE POWER IS CONCERNED THEY DO NOT REALLY CRITICIZE THEY SERVE A CLIQUE WHOM THEY SHOULD EXPOSE AND DENOUNCE AND BETRAY THE GENERALITY THAT IS THE STATE FOR WHOSE SAKE THE SALARIED PUBLIC SERVANTS SHOULD BE PERPETUALLY WATCHED WITH SUSPICION AND SHARPLY KEPT IN CONTROL
THEY SUSPECT THAT THE KNOWN GROSS CORRUPTION OF PUBLIC LIFE AND PARTICULARLY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS ENTRENCHED BEHIND A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE ON THE PART OF THOSE VERY FEW WHO HAVE THE POWER TO INFORM THEM BUT AS YET THEY HAVE NOT PASSED THE STAGE OF SUCH SUSPICION
AND ESPECIALLY TO THE ONE MOST WEALTHY AND UNSCRUPULOUS AMONG THEM WHOSE WEALTH IS AN ACCIDENT OF SPECULATION WHOSE ORIGINS ARE REPULSIVE AND WHOSE CHARACTERS HAVE AS A RULE THE WEAKNESS AND BASENESS DEVELOPED BY THIS SORT OF ADVENTURES
EVEN WHEN GAMBLING ADVENTURERS OF THIS SORT ARE KNOWN AND RESPONSIBLE AS THEY ARE IN PROFESSIONAL POLITICS THEIR POWER IS A GRAVE DANGER POSSESSING AS THE NEWSPAPER OWNERS DO EVERY POWER OF CONCEALMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME
NO SHRED OF RESPONSIBILITY TO ANY ORGAN OF THE STATE THEY ARE A DEADLY PERIL THE CHIEF OF THESE MEN ARE MORE POWERFUL TO DAY THAN ANY MINISTER NAY THEY DO AS I HAVE SAID AND IT IS NOW NOTORIOUS MAKE AND UNMAKE MINISTERS AND THEY MAY YET IN OUR WORST HOUR DECIDE THE NATIONAL FATE
NOW TO EVERY HUMAN EVIL OF A POLITICAL SORT THAT HAS APPEARED IN HISTORY TO EVERY EVIL THAT IS AFFECTING THE STATE AND PROCEEDING FROM THE WILL OF MAN NOT FROM UNGOVERNABLE NATURAL FORCES OUTSIDE MAN THERE COMES A TERM AND A REACTION
THE MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA WHICH BEGAN TO WORK MUCH THE EARLIEST OF THE THREE CONCERNED RELIGIONS AND ALSO CERTAIN RACIAL ENTHUSIASMS OR POLITICAL DOCTRINES WHICH BY THEIR SINCERITY AND READINESS FOR SACRIFICE HAD HALF THE FORCE OF RELIGIONS
AGAIN OF A RELIGIOUS TEMPER IN THEIR SEGREGATION CONVICTION AND ENTHUSIASM THERE BEGAN TO APPEAR WHEN THE OPPRESSOR WAS MILD THE SMALL PAPERS DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF OPPRESSED NATIONALITIES
RELIGION THEN AND COGNATE ENTHUSIASMS WERE THE FIRST BREEDERS OF THE FREE PRESS IT IS EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THIS BECAUSE IT HAS STAMPED THE WHOLE MOVEMENT WITH A PARTICULAR CHARACTER TO WHICH I SHALL LATER REFER WHEN I COME TO ITS DISABILITIES
FOR VICTORIAN ENGLAND AND THIRD EMPIRE FRANCE FALSELY PROCLAIMED THE REPRESENTATIVE QUALITY OF THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO THE HONOUR OF THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT THE SOCIALIST FREE PRESS WAS THE FIRST TO STAND UP AS AN EQUAL AGAINST THE GIANTS
THOUGH HOWEVER CERTAIN OF THE SOCIALIST FREE PAPERS THUS BOLDLY TOOK UP A STANDPOINT OF MORAL EQUALITY WITH THE OTHERS THEIR ATTITUDE WAS EXCEPTIONAL
IF ONE PASSES IN REVIEW ALL THE FREE PRESS JOURNALS WHICH OWED THEIR EXISTENCE IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE ALONE TO THIS MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA ONE FINDS MANY SIDE SHOWS AS IT WERE BESIDE THE MAIN MOTIVES OF LOCAL OR RACE PATRIOTISM RELIGION OR SOCIALIST CONVICTION
I MEAN THAT THE FREE PRESS HAS HAD STAMPED UPON IT THE CHARACTER OF DISPARATE PARTICULARISM
IF YOU ADD IT ALL UP AND CANCEL OUT ONE EXAGGERATED STATEMENT AGAINST ANOTHER DOES GIVE YOU A TRUE VIEW OF THE STATE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH YOU LIVE THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO DAY GIVES YOU AN ABSURDLY FALSE ONE EVERYWHERE
NO ONE OF THEM IS IN ANY SENSE GENERAL OR REALLY NATIONAL THE FREE PRESS GIVES YOU THE TRUTH BUT ONLY IN DISJOINTED SECTIONS FOR IT IS DISPARATE AND IT IS PARTICULARIST IT IS MARKED WITH ISOLATION AND IT IS SO MARKED BECAUSE ITS ORIGIN LAY IN VARIOUS AND MOST DIVERSE PROPAGANDA
WHY SHOULD THIS OR THAT VULGARIAN MEN BEGAN TO SAY EXERCISE AND BOAST OF THE POWER TO KEEP THE PEOPLE IGNORANT UPON MATTERS VITAL TO US ALL TO DISTORT
THAT IS WHY YOU NEARLY ALWAYS FIND THE FREE PRESS DIRECTED BY MEN OF INTELLIGENCE AND CULTIVATION OF EXCEPTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND CULTIVATION AND THAT IS WHERE IT CONTRASTS MOST WITH ITS OPPONENTS C
BUT ONLY A LITTLE LATER THAN THIS SECOND MOTIVE OF INDIGNATION AGAINST FALSEHOOD AND ACTING WITH EQUAL FORCE THOUGH UPON FEWER MEN WAS THE THIRD MOTIVE OF FREEDOM OF INDIGNATION AGAINST ARBITRARY POWER
BUT IT IS INTOLERABLE THAT SIMILAR POWER SHOULD RESIDE IN THE HANDS OF OBSCURE NOBODIES ABOUT WHOM NO ILLUSION COULD POSSIBLY EXIST WHOSE TYRANNY IS NOT ADMITTED OR PUBLIC AT ALL WHO DO NOT EVEN TAKE THE RISK OF EXPOSING THEIR FEATURES AND TO WHOM NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATEVER ATTACHES
THAT HE HAD ALWAYS CHERISHED AN ABHORRENCE OF SLAVERY AND A BITTER ANTIPATHY TO SLAVE HOLDERS AS A CLASS IS SUFFICIENTLY INDICATED BY MANY CHANCE REMARKS SCATTERED
OVERAWE HIM NOR LONELINESS DISPIRIT HIM HE WAS PROBABLY THE MOST FORMIDABLE FIGHTER IN DEBATE OF WHOM PARLIAMENTARY RECORDS PRESERVE THE MEMORY
HAVING A NATURAL DISTASTE FOR DISQUIETING AGITATION AND INFLUENCED BY CLASS FEELING THE GENTLEMEN OF THE NORTH SYMPATHIZING WITH THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE SOUTH COULD NOT MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH ANTI SLAVERY PEOPLE FORTUNATELY
WHEN HIS FELLOW REPRESENTATIVES ALMOST TO A MAN DESERTED HIM HE WAS SUSTAINED BY MANY A TOKEN OF SYMPATHY AND ADMIRATION COMING FROM AMONG THE PEOPLE AT LARGE
THEY HAD ASSUMED AN UNTENABLE POSITION HENCEFORTH
MISTER ADAMS HAD A SUPPORT AMONG THE PEOPLE AT LARGE VASTLY GREATER THAN HE COULD HAVE ENJOYED AS THE OPPONENT OF SLAVERY AS HIS ADVERSARIES HAD SHAPED THE ISSUE HE WAS PREDESTINED TO VICTORY IN A FREE COUNTRY
HE BROUGHT UP THE MATTER AGAIN ONE OF HIS OPPONENTS MADE A FALSE STEP AND MISTER ADAMS BANTERED HIM UPON IT UNTIL THE OTHER WAS PROVOKED INTO SAYING THAT IF THE QUESTION EVER CAME TO THE ISSUE OF WAR THE SOUTHERN PEOPLE
AND SO FAR THAT SCARCELY A SLAVE HOLDING MEMBER OF THE HOUSE DARES TO VOTE WITH ME UPON ANY QUESTION I HAVE AS YET BEEN THOROUGHLY SUSTAINED BY MY OWN STATE BUT ONE STEP FURTHER AND I HAZARD MY OWN STANDING AND INFLUENCE THERE
WHICH IS MOVING ONWARD IN THE WORLD AND IN THIS COUNTRY I WOULD WITHDRAW FROM THE CONTEST WHICH WILL RAGE WITH INCREASING FURY AS IT DRAWS TO ITS CRISIS BUT FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF WHICH MY AGE INFIRMITIES AND APPROACHING END
IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN STILL AT THIS SAME WORK HE MADE A HARD BUT FRUITLESS EFFORT
ALL LAID ON THE TABLE JANUARY FIFTEENTH HE PRESENTED FIFTY MORE JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH HE RECEIVED THIRTY ONE PETITIONS AND SPENT THAT DAY AND THE NEXT IN ASSORTING AND FILING THESE AND OTHERS WHICH HE PREVIOUSLY HAD AMOUNTING IN ALL TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY
WHEN THE WORLD WAS WITHOUT FORM AND VOID AND THE SNAKE SAID WHY THEN DID HE NOT SPEAK LIKE THAT TO MY LEOPOLD WHY DID HE NOT COMFORT HIM WITH SUCH A GOOD HOPE
FOR THE TIME AT LEAST THAN WHEN OCEANS LAY BETWIXT THEIR BIRTH AND THEIR MEETING AND HE FOUND HIMSELF LOOKING BACK WITH VAGUE LONGING EVEN TO THE TERRIBLE OLD HOUSE OF GLASTON
THERE WAS SOMETHING EITHER IN THE CURATE OR IN THE SERMON THAT HAD QUIETED HER A LITTLE AND SHE WAS LESS CONTEMPTUOUS IN HER CONDEMNATION OF HIM THAN USUAL HAPPILY BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND OTHERS THE CURATE
APOSTOLIC CAREFULNESS HAVE PROTECTED HIM I SUSPECT IT WOULD ONLY HAVE GIVEN RISE TO MORE VULGAR MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND MISREPRESENTATIONS STILL TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WHO LOVES NOT IS BUT TO GIVE HIM THE MORE
AMOUNTING OF COURSE TO MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY MISTER CHILDS HAS TAKEN CARE OF MANY WHO HAVE BECOME OLD OR DISABLED IN HIS SERVICE THE FOREMAN OF HIS COMPOSING ROOM HAD WORKED FOR HIM LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE HE FAILED IN HEALTH
FOR YEARS THIS MAN HAS DRAWN HIS WEEKLY PAY THOUGH NEVER GOING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT THIS IS INDEED PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY BESIDES CARING FOR THE LIVING IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT THIS WISE EMPLOYER OF LABOR
HE LISTENS COURTEOUSLY TO ANY REQUESTS AND THEN BIDS YOU MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME IN THIS ELEGANT OFFICE THAT CERTAINLY HAS NO SUPERIOR IN THE WORLD PERHAPS NO RIVAL
WARWICKSHIRE THE SEAT OF THE EARLS CRAVEN FITTED UP BY ONE OF ITS LORDS FOR THE RECEPTION OF QUEEN ELIZABETH OVER A DOZEN VALUABLE CLOCKS ARE SEEN ONE MADE IN AMSTERDAM OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO
WHICH BESIDES THE TIME OF DAY GIVES THE PHASES OF THE MOON THE DAYS OF THE WEEK AND THE MONTH ANOTHER A CLOCK CONSTRUCTED BY DAVID RITTENHOUSE THE ASTRONOMER OF THE REVOLUTION IN THE OLD COLONIAL DAYS WHICH PLAYS A GREAT VARIETY OF MUSIC
HIS HABITS WERE THE BEST AND WHY SHOULD NOT SUCH A BOY SUCCEED IN THREE YEARS WHEN HE WAS TWENTY ONE HE HAD BECOME THE HEAD OF A PUBLISHING HOUSE
AS A PUBLISHER BUT THE PRIZE THAT HE HAD SET OUT TO WIN WAS TO OWN THE PUBLIC LEDGER THE OPPORTUNITY CAME IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR BUT HIS PAPER WAS LOSING MONEY HIS FRIENDS ADVISED AGAINST TAKING SUCH A BURDEN HE WOULD SURELY FAIL
HE BOUGHT THE PROPERTY DOUBLED THE SUBSCRIPTION RATES LOWERED THE ADVERTISING EXCLUDED EVERYTHING QUESTIONABLE FROM THE COLUMNS OF HIS PAPER MADE HIS EDITORIALS BRIEF YET COMPREHENSIVE UNTIL UNDER HIS JUDICIOUS MANAGEMENT THE JOURNAL REACHED THE LARGE CIRCULATION
OF NINETY THOUSAND DAILY FOR TEN YEARS HE HAS GIVEN THE LEDGER ALMANAC TO EVERY SUBSCRIBER COSTING FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY THE YEARLY PROFITS IT IS STATED HAVE BEEN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
ALL THIS HAS NOT BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT THOUGHT AND LABOR FORTUNE OF COURSE HAD COME AND FAME HE BUILT HOMES ELEGANT ONES IN PHILADELPHIA AND AT NEWPORT BUT THESE ARE NOT SIMPLY PLACES IN WHICH TO SPEND MONEY BUT CENTRES

BY DEGREES I REMEMBER A STRONGER LIGHT PRESSED UPON MY NERVES SO THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SHUT MY EYES DARKNESS THEN CAME OVER ME AND TROUBLED ME BUT HARDLY HAD I FELT THIS WHEN BY OPENING MY EYES AS I NOW SUPPOSE
THE LIGHT BECAME MORE AND MORE OPPRESSIVE TO ME
I SLAKED MY THIRST AT THE BROOK AND THEN LYING DOWN WAS OVERCOME BY SLEEP IT WAS DARK WHEN I AWOKE I FELT COLD ALSO AND HALF FRIGHTENED
AS IT WERE INSTINCTIVELY FINDING MYSELF SO DESOLATE
AND TO PERCEIVE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE RADIANT ROOF
AND TASTED MUCH MORE SAVOURY THAN THE BERRIES I GATHERED FROM THE TREES I TRIED THEREFORE TO DRESS MY FOOD IN THE SAME MANNER PLACING IT ON THE LIVE EMBERS
I STRUCK ACROSS THE WOOD TOWARDS THE SETTING SUN I PASSED THREE DAYS IN THESE RAMBLES AND AT LENGTH DISCOVERED THE OPEN COUNTRY A GREAT FALL OF SNOW HAD TAKEN PLACE THE NIGHT BEFORE
NO WOOD HOWEVER WAS PLACED ON THE EARTH WHICH FORMED THE FLOOR BUT IT WAS DRY AND ALTHOUGH THE WIND ENTERED IT BY INNUMERABLE CHINKS I FOUND IT AN AGREEABLE ASYLUM FROM THE SNOW AND RAIN
HOWEVER MISERABLE FROM THE INCLEMENCY OF THE SEASON AND STILL MORE FROM THE BARBARITY OF MAN
BY A LOAF OF COARSE BREAD WHICH I PURLOINED AND A CUP
THEY WERE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS COMPANION OFTEN WENT APART AND APPEARED TO WEEP I SAW NO CAUSE FOR THEIR UNHAPPINESS BUT I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT IF SUCH LOVELY CREATURES WERE MISERABLE
WHEN ITS MASTERS COULD SCARCELY PROCURE FOOD TO SUPPORT IT THEY OFTEN I BELIEVE SUFFERED THE PANGS OF HUNGER VERY POIGNANTLY ESPECIALLY THE TWO YOUNGER COTTAGERS FOR SEVERAL TIMES THEY PLACED FOOD BEFORE THE OLD MAN WHEN THEY RESERVED NONE FOR THEMSELVES
I ABSTAINED AND SATISFIED MYSELF WITH BERRIES NUTS AND ROOTS WHICH I GATHERED FROM A NEIGHBOURING WOOD
AND BROUGHT HOME FIRING SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF SEVERAL DAYS
SHE UTTERED SOME WORDS IN A LOUD VOICE AND THE YOUTH JOINED HER WHO ALSO EXPRESSED SURPRISE I OBSERVED WITH PLEASURE THAT HE DID NOT GO TO THE FOREST THAT DAY BUT SPENT IT IN REPAIRING THE COTTAGE AND CULTIVATING THE GARDEN
AND AFTER HAVING REMAINED DURING THE SPACE OF SEVERAL REVOLUTIONS OF THE MOON IN MY HOVEL I DISCOVERED THE NAMES THAT WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE MOST FAMILIAR OBJECTS OF DISCOURSE I LEARNED AND APPLIED THE WORDS FIRE MILK BREAD AND WOOD
WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OF THESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM
WHEN THEY WERE UNHAPPY I FELT DEPRESSED WHEN THEY REJOICED I SYMPATHIZED IN THEIR JOYS
FROM BENEATH THE SNOWY GROUND EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE SHE HAD RISEN
WHICH KNOWLEDGE MIGHT ENABLE ME TO MAKE THEM OVERLOOK THE DEFORMITY OF MY FIGURE
AND ONCE OR TWICE I HEARD THEM ON THESE OCCASIONS UTTER THE WORDS GOOD SPIRIT WONDERFUL
IT SURPRISED ME THAT WHAT BEFORE WAS DESERT AND GLOOMY SHOULD NOW BLOOM WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND VERDURE
RETIRED EARLY WHEN THEY SEPARATED FELIX KISSED THE HAND OF THE STRANGER AND SAID GOOD NIGHT SWEET SAFIE HE SAT UP MUCH LONGER CONVERSING WITH HIS FATHER AND BY THE FREQUENT REPETITION OF HER NAME I CONJECTURED THAT THEIR LOVELY GUEST
THE DAYS NOW PASSED AS PEACEABLY AS BEFORE WITH THE SOLE ALTERATION THAT
MY DAYS WERE SPENT IN CLOSE ATTENTION THAT I MIGHT MORE SPEEDILY MASTER THE LANGUAGE AND I MAY BOAST
WHO UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE AND CONVERSED IN BROKEN ACCENTS WHILST I COMPREHENDED AND COULD IMITATE ALMOST EVERY WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN WHILE I IMPROVED IN SPEECH I ALSO LEARNED THE SCIENCE OF LETTERS AS IT WAS TAUGHT TO THE STRANGER AND THIS OPENED BEFORE ME
OR EVEN WHY THERE WERE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS BUT WHEN I HEARD DETAILS OF VICE AND BLOODSHED MY WONDER CEASED AND I TURNED AWAY WITH DISGUST AND LOATHING EVERY CONVERSATION OF THE COTTAGERS NOW OPENED NEW WONDERS TO ME
I HEARD OF THE DIVISION OF PROPERTY OF IMMENSE WEALTH AND SQUALID POVERTY OF RANK DESCENT AND NOBLE BLOOD
HOW THE FATHER DOTED ON THE SMILES OF THE INFANT
NO MOTHER HAD BLESSED ME WITH SMILES AND CARESSES
ALL MY PAST LIFE WAS NOW A BLOT A BLIND VACANCY IN WHICH I DISTINGUISHED NOTHING FROM MY EARLIEST REMEMBRANCE I HAD BEEN AS I THEN WAS IN HEIGHT AND PROPORTION
IN THEIR EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE HAVE NAMED IT THE LIONS DEN PROBABLY BECAUSE THE CAPTIVES POSSESS TEETH WHICH FREQUENTLY GNAW THE BARS AND SOMETIMES THE KEEPERS ALSO IT IS A PRISON WITHIN A PRISON
ANOTHER KIND OF RECREATION IN WHICH A HANDKERCHIEF IS FILLED WITH SAND PEBBLES
HE WAS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THEM THE HANDKERCHIEF WAS THROWN DOWN AND THE IRON HEELED SHOE REPLACED ON THE FOOT OF THE WRETCH TO WHOM IT BELONGED SOME VOICES WERE HEARD TO SAY THAT THE GENTLEMAN WAS RIGHT
YOU SPEAK FIRST OH NO YOU MUST HAVE MUCH TO TELL ME SINCE YOU HAVE COME TO SEEK ME WELL BE IT SO YOU HAVE CONTINUED YOUR COURSE OF VILLANY YOU HAVE ROBBED
BUT IT WAS NOT YOU I PRESUME WHO PLACED AT MY DISPOSAL ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH I SPENT IN FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS IT WAS NOT YOU WHO MANUFACTURED AN ITALIAN GENTLEMAN FOR MY FATHER
WORTHY FOSTER FATHER WELL WELL
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ENGAGED WITH A PYGMY LIKE YOURSELF
I WILL RETURN TO MORROW
WHICH HAD RESTORED THE COURAGE OF NOIRTIER FOR EVER SINCE HE HAD CONVERSED WITH THE PRIEST HIS VIOLENT DESPAIR HAD YIELDED TO A CALM RESIGNATION WHICH SURPRISED ALL WHO KNEW HIS EXCESSIVE AFFECTION
HAD NOT SEEN HIS FATHER SINCE THE MORNING OF THE DEATH THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT HAD BEEN CHANGED ANOTHER VALET WAS ENGAGED FOR HIMSELF
WHICH WERE THE ONLY MEANS HE HAD OF DISSIPATING HIS GRIEF ONCE ONLY HAD VILLEFORT SEEN HIS FATHER
HOWEVER AT LENGTH HE DECIDED LEAPED OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO A CLUSTER OF HELIOTROPES AND DAISIES AND RAN TO HIS MOTHER HIS FOREHEAD STREAMING WITH PERSPIRATION
LIKE THAT OF THE BIRD TO THE SERPENT WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AS HE APPROACHED IT
IT IS WELL SIR REPLIED VILLEFORT FROM BELOW IT IS WELL HAVE PATIENCE BUT ONE DAY LONGER WHAT I HAVE SAID I WILL DO NOIRTIER SEEMED TO BE CALMED BY THESE WORDS
OF NOIRTIER'S ROOM WHERE HE HAD SEEN HIM THE PRECEDING NIGHT THE CURTAIN WAS DRAWN AND YET THE IMAGE OF HIS FATHER WAS SO VIVID TO HIS MIND THAT HE ADDRESSED THE CLOSED WINDOW AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN OPEN
THEN HE THREW HIMSELF DRESSED AS HE WAS UPON A SOFA LESS TO SLEEP THAN TO REST HIS LIMBS CRAMPED WITH COLD AND STUDY BY DEGREES EVERY ONE AWOKE
THE BREAKFAST HOUR ARRIVED
SHE IS QUITE READY AND WISHES TO KNOW IF SHE IS TO ACCOMPANY YOU SIR WHERE TO
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HE SAID MY MISTRESS SAID SHE SHOULD EXPECT YOU SIR AS SOON AS YOU HAD FINISHED DRESSING I AM GOING TO HER AND VILLEFORT WITH HIS PAPERS UNDER HIS ARM AND HAT IN HAND
AND COLD AS A STATUE EDWARD SAID VILLEFORT FIXING AN IMPERIOUS GLANCE ON THE CHILD GO AND PLAY IN THE DRAWING ROOM MY DEAR I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOUR MAMMA
THE CHILD UNACCUSTOMED TO SUCH TREATMENT AROSE PALE AND TREMBLING
SHE MUTTERED AH SIR AND THIS WAS ALL YOU DO NOT ANSWER MADAME EXCLAIMED THE TERRIBLE INTERROGATOR THEN HE ADDED WITH A SMILE YET MORE TERRIBLE THAN HIS ANGER
CAN YOU BE A COWARD CONTINUED VILLEFORT WITH INCREASING EXCITEMENT YOU WHO COULD COUNT ONE BY ONE THE MINUTES OF FOUR DEATH AGONIES YOU WHO HAVE ARRANGED YOUR INFERNAL PLANS
WHAT DID I SAY OH MY BRAIN WHIRLS I NO LONGER UNDERSTAND ANYTHING OH MY GOD MY GOD AND SHE ROSE WITH HER HAIR DISHEVELLED AND HER LIPS FOAMING
SHE VOCIFERATED NO YOU CANNOT WISH THAT WHAT I DO NOT WISH MADAME IS THAT YOU SHOULD PERISH ON THE SCAFFOLD DO YOU UNDERSTAND ASKED VILLEFORT OH MERCY
THINK OF IT MADAME HE SAID IF ON MY RETURN
IN THE MONTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE ROME AS YOU ARE NO DOUBT AWARE WAS PLACED IN A STATE OF SIEGE BY THE APPROACH OF THE FRENCH ARMY IT WAS FILLED AT THAT TIME WITH EXILES AND FUGITIVES
HER HEART AND SOUL WERE IN THE CAUSE FOR WHICH THOSE MEN HAD FOUGHT AND ALL WAS DONE THAT WOMAN COULD DO TO COMFORT THEM IN THEIR SUFFERINGS I HAVE SEEN THE EYES OF THE DYING AS SHE MOVED AMONG THEM EXTENDED ON OPPOSITE BEDS MEET IN COMMENDATION OF HER UNIVERSAL KINDNESS
WHO WAS GAINING THE BREAD OF AN EXILE BY TEACHING LANGUAGES IN CONSTANTINOPLE SHE ALLUDES WITH MUCH FEELING TO THE SUPPORT AFFORDED BY MISS FULLER TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN ITALY HERE IN ROME SHE IS STILL SPOKEN OF IN TERMS OF REGARD AND ENDEARMENT
WHAT IS THE MATTER SAID ALBERT ENTERING NO CARRIAGE TO BE HAD JUST SO RETURNED FRANZ YOU HAVE GUESSED IT WELL YOUR ETERNAL CITY IS A NICE SORT OF PLACE
UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THERE WAS ONLY ONE LEFT ON THE FIFTH FLOOR OF THE DORIA PALACE AND THAT HAS BEEN LET TO A RUSSIAN PRINCE FOR TWENTY SEQUINS A DAY THE TWO YOUNG MEN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH AN AIR OF STUPEFACTION WELL
BRAVO AN EXCELLENT IDEA WE WILL DISGUISE OURSELVES AS MONSTER PULCHINELLOS
RETURNED SIGNOR PASTRINI WITH THE SMILE PECULIAR TO THE ITALIAN SPECULATOR WHEN HE CONFESSES DEFEAT I WILL DO ALL I CAN AND I HOPE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED AND NOW WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
SHALL I BRING THE CARRIAGE NEARER TO THE PALACE ACCUSTOMED AS FRANZ WAS TO THE ITALIAN PHRASEOLOGY HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO LOOK ROUND HIM BUT THESE WORDS WERE ADDRESSED TO HIM FRANZ WAS THE EXCELLENCY
THE TEMPLE OF ANTONINUS AND FAUSTINA AND THE VIA SACRA THEY SAT DOWN TO DINNER SIGNOR PASTRINI HAD PROMISED THEM A BANQUET HE GAVE THEM A TOLERABLE REPAST AT THE END OF THE DINNER HE ENTERED IN PERSON
OR BLOCKHEADS LIKE US EVER DO TRAVEL MEN IN THEIR SENSES DO NOT QUIT THEIR HOTEL IN THE RUE DU HELDER THEIR WALK ON THE BOULEVARD DE GAND AND THE CAFE DE PARIS IT
AND LEVEL THEIR PIECES AT YOU EH PARBLEU THEY SHOULD KILL ME THE INN KEEPER TURNED TO FRANZ WITH AN AIR THAT SEEMED TO SAY YOUR FRIEND IS DECIDEDLY MAD MY DEAR ALBERT RETURNED FRANZ
TELL ME WHO IS THIS LUIGI VAMPA IS HE A SHEPHERD OR A NOBLEMAN YOUNG OR OLD TALL OR SHORT DESCRIBE HIM IN ORDER THAT IF WE MEET HIM BY CHANCE LIKE BUGABOO JOHN OR LARA WE MAY RECOGNIZE HIM
YOU COULD NOT APPLY TO ANY ONE BETTER ABLE TO INFORM YOU ON ALL THESE POINTS FOR I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS A CHILD AND ONE DAY THAT I FELL INTO HIS HANDS GOING FROM FERENTINO TO ALATRI HE FORTUNATELY FOR ME
AT THE MOMENT SIGNOR PASTRINI WAS ABOUT TO OPEN HIS MOUTH THAT YOU KNEW LUIGI VAMPA WHEN HE WAS A CHILD
HE WAS BORN AT PAMPINARA AND ENTERED THE COUNT'S SERVICE WHEN HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD HIS FATHER WAS ALSO A SHEPHERD WHO OWNED A SMALL FLOCK AND LIVED BY THE WOOL AND THE MILK WHICH HE SOLD AT ROME WHEN QUITE A CHILD THE LITTLE VAMPA DISPLAYED A MOST EXTRAORDINARY PRECOCITY
EVERY DAY LUIGI LED HIS FLOCK TO GRAZE ON THE ROAD THAT LEADS FROM PALESTRINA TO BORGO EVERY DAY AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE PRIEST AND THE BOY SAT DOWN ON A BANK BY THE WAYSIDE
AT THE END OF A WEEK HE WROTE AS WELL WITH THIS PEN AS WITH THE STYLUS THE CURATE RELATED THE INCIDENT TO THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE WHO SENT FOR THE LITTLE SHEPHERD MADE HIM READ AND WRITE BEFORE HIM ORDERED HIS ATTENDANT TO LET HIM EAT WITH THE DOMESTICS AND TO GIVE HIM TWO PIASTRES A MONTH
THE TWO PIASTRES THAT LUIGI RECEIVED EVERY MONTH FROM THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE'S STEWARD AND THE PRICE OF ALL THE LITTLE CARVINGS IN WOOD HE SOLD AT ROME WERE EXPENDED IN EAR RINGS NECKLACES AND GOLD HAIRPINS SO THAT THANKS TO HER FRIEND'S GENEROSITY
WHENCE THE CRY CAME AFTER A HUNDRED YARDS HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE THICKET HE FOUND RITA SENSELESS IN THE ARMS OF CUCUMETTO AT THE SIGHT OF CARLINI CUCUMETTO ROSE A PISTOL IN EACH HAND THE TWO BRIGANDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT
THIS YOUNG GIRL IS CHARMING AND DOES CREDIT TO YOUR TASTE NOW AS I AM NOT EGOTISTICAL WE WILL RETURN TO OUR COMRADES AND DRAW LOTS FOR HER HAVE DETERMINED THEN TO ABANDON HER TO THE COMMON LAW SAID CARLINI
HE CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE PATH TO THE GLADE BUT TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE CARLINI ARRIVED ALMOST AS SOON AS HIMSELF LET US DRAW LOTS LET US DRAW LOTS CRIED ALL THE BRIGANDS WHEN THEY SAW THE CHIEF
AND TO WHOM CARLINI REPLIED BY BREAKING THE GLASS ACROSS HIS FACE A LARGE WOUND EXTENDING FROM THE TEMPLE TO THE MOUTH WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY DIOVALACCIO SEEING HIMSELF THUS FAVORED BY FORTUNE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH CAPTAIN
RETURNED THE CHIEF SHE IS THINE CARLINI RAISED HER IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER OUT OF THE CIRCLE OF FIRELIGHT CUCUMETTO PLACED HIS SENTINELS FOR THE NIGHT AND THE BANDITS WRAPPED THEMSELVES IN THEIR CLOAKS AND LAY DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
THE WOMAN'S FACE BECAME VISIBLE THE OLD MAN RECOGNIZED HIS CHILD AND CARLINI RECOGNIZED THE OLD MAN I EXPECTED THEE SAID THE BANDIT TO RITA'S FATHER
I LOVED HER THEREFORE I SLEW HER FOR SHE WOULD HAVE SERVED AS THE SPORT OF THE WHOLE BAND THE OLD MAN SPOKE NOT AND GREW PALE AS DEATH NOW CONTINUED CARLINI IF I HAVE DONE WRONGLY AVENGE HER
THEN EXTENDING HIS HAND THE OLD MAN SAID I THANK YOU MY SON AND NOW LEAVE ME ALONE
I COMMAND YOU CARLINI OBEYED REJOINED HIS COMRADES FOLDED HIMSELF IN HIS CLOAK AND SOON APPEARED TO SLEEP AS SOUNDLY AS THE REST IT HAD BEEN RESOLVED THE NIGHT BEFORE TO CHANGE THEIR ENCAMPMENT
HE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A BALL BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS THAT ASTONISHMENT CEASED WHEN ONE OF THE BRIGANDS REMARKED TO HIS COMRADES THAT CUCUMETTO WAS STATIONED TEN PACES IN CARLINI'S REAR WHEN HE FELL ON THE MORNING OF THE DEPARTURE FROM THE FOREST OF FROSINONE
NOT THAT HE HAS NOT HAD HIS DISCIPLES MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE THAT WHAT MISTER SHAW SAYS ON ANY CONCEIVABLE SUBJECT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT THE TIMES OR THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN SAYS HE HAS NEVER FOUNDED A CHURCH HOWEVER
BECAUSE HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO LAUGH AT HIS DISCIPLES AS UNFEELINGLY AS AT ANYBODY ELSE HE HAS COURTED UNPOPULARITY AS OTHER MEN HAVE COURTED POPULARITY HE HAS REFUSED TO ASSUME THE VACUOUS COUNTENANCE EITHER OF AN IDOL
PROBABLY HE WAS DOOMED TO BE A FIGURE JUST AS DOCTOR JOHNSON WAS IF HE HAD NOT TOLD US LEGENDS ABOUT HIMSELF
IN SEARCH OF A GHOST WITH ITS BEARD ON FIRE HIS CRITICS OFTEN ACCUSE HIM IN REGARD TO THE INVENTION OF THE SHAW MYTH OF HAVING DESIGNED A POSTER RATHER THAN PAINTED A PORTRAIT
DECLARE THAT BERNARD SHAW DOES DEPICT CHARACTERS
MOLIERE DEPICTS THE MISER THE JEALOUS MAN THE MISANTHROPE THE HYPOCRITE WHEREAS SHAW DEPICTS THE BOURGEOIS THE REBEL THE CAPITALIST THE WORKMAN THE SOCIALIST THE DOCTOR
HE HAS DERIDED THEM WITH BOTH AN ARTISTIC AND A MORAL ENERGY HE HAS BROUGHT THEM ALL INTO A PALACE OF TRUTH WHERE THEY HAVE REVEALED THEMSELVES WITH AN UNACCUSTOMED AND STARTLING FRANKNESS
HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO WOUND AND HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO MISUNDERSTAND BUT HE IS FREE FROM MALICE THE GENIALITY OF HIS COMEDY ON THE OTHER HAND IS OFTEN MORE OFFENSIVE THAN MALICE
HE SEES CURRENT HISTORY FROM THE ABSOLUTELY OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW SAY TO THE LYRIC POET
THIS IS NOT TO DISPARAGE MISTER SHAW'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DISCUSSION OF POLITICS THAT CONTRIBUTION HAS BEEN BRILLIANT CHALLENGING AND HUMANE AND NOT MORE WAYWARD THAN THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE PARTISAN
SHALL WE SEND BOBO IN SEARCH OF THE LOST HALF HOUR SAID THE PRINCESS TO THE COURTIERS YES YES CRIED THE COURTIERS BOBO SHALL LOOK FOR THE LOST HALF HOUR I'LL GIVE HIM A HORSE SAID ONE
WHEN HE RETURNED THE GOOD KITCHEN MAID SAID LITTLE FOR SHE FEARED LEST SOME MISADVENTURE OVERTAKE THE POOR SIMPLETON BUT WHEN THE CHIEF COOK WAS NOT LOOKING SHE TUCKED A FRESH CURRANT BUN INTO BOBO'S POCKET
ANSWER ME YOU SILLY HAVE YOU SEEN A LOST TEMPER ANYWHERE IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE MELON AND HAS SHARP LITTLE POINTS ON BOBO'S ANSWERING NO THIS DREADFUL PERSON UTTERED SO PERFECTLY AWFUL A SCREECH OF RAGE
HERE THE POOR OLD KING TOOK OUT A GREAT GREEN HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HIS EYES SHE WAS STOLEN BY THE FAIRIES ON MIDSUMMER EVE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO FIND HER WORTHY BOBO AND AN IMMENSE REWARD WILL BE YOURS
SO BOBO OBEDIENTLY LET THE SHOES GUIDE HIM AT CORNERS THE SHOES ALWAYS TURNED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IF BOBO FORGOT AND BLUNDERED ON THE WRONG WAY THE SHOES SWIFTLY BEGAN TO PINCH HIS TOES
FOR HAD YOU NOT BEEN WRECKED UPON THIS ISLAND NEVER WOULD YOU HAVE DISCOVERED THE LOST HALF HOUR I AM FATHER TIME HIMSELF AND THESE ARE MY TWELVE SONS THE HOURS EVERY DAY ONE AFTER THE OTHER
AS FOR THE MISSING DAUGHTER SHE IS THE KITCHEN MAID IN PRINCESS ZENZA'S PALACE WHO IS KNOWN AS TILDA SO BOBO THANKED FATHER TIME AND AT NOON
WHEN THEY GOT TO THE SEASHORE THE WHITE HORSE HESITATED NOT AN INSTANT BUT SET FOOT UPON THE WATER WHICH BORE HIM UP AS IF IT HAD BEEN NOT WATER BUT EARTH ITSELF
BOBO WITH GREAT GOODNESS OF HEART TOOK ALONG THIS EXTRAORDINARY OBJECT IN THE HOPE OF FINDING ITS ANGRY POSSESSOR FARTHER ON THE LAD ENCOUNTERED TILDA'S FATHER THE UNHAPPY KING AND DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE
THE JOY OF THE MONARCH KNEW NO BOUNDS AND BOBO THE ONE TIME SIMPLETON BECAME ON THE SPOT LORD BOBO OF THE SAPPHIRE HILLS MARQUIS OF THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON PRINCE OF THE VALLEY OF GOLDEN APPLES
AND THE BREASTPLATES OF THE ARMED MEN SHINING IN THE SUN AFTER A WEEK OF ALMOST CONSTANT PROGRESS FOR THE KING WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS BELOVED DAUGHTER THAT HE WOULD HARDLY GIVE THE CAVALCADE TIME TO REST
EVIL DAYS HAVE FALLEN UPON OUR UNHAPPY KINGDOM THREE DAYS AGO A TERRIBLE DRAGON ALIGHTED IN THE GARDENS OF THE PALACE AND SENT WORD TO PRINCESS ZENZA THAT IF WITHIN THREE DAYS SHE DID NOT PROVIDE HIM WITH SOMEONE BRAVE ENOUGH TO GO HOME WITH HIM AND COOK HIS MEALS
AND KEEP HIS CAVERN TIDY HE WOULD BURN OUR FIELDS WITH HIS FIERY BREATH YET WHO I ASK YOU WOULD BE HOUSEKEEPER FOR A DRAGON
THINGS SHOULD BE EXACTLY AS THEY WERE HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE OPENED THE COVER OF THE EBONY BOX SOMETHING LIKE A WINGED WHITE FLAME ESCAPED FROM IT AND FLEW HISSING THROUGH THE AIR TO THE SUN
HOW SOON KEYS WERE ADDED TO THE MONOCHORD AS THIS MEASURING INSTRUMENT WAS NAMED CANNOT POSITIVELY BE ASCERTAINED WE MAY SAFELY ASSUME IT WAS NOT SLOW IN ADOPTING THE RUDE KEYBOARD ASCRIBED BY TRADITION TO PAN PIPES
ALSO IT WOULD BRING YOU BUT LITTLE PLEASURE OR RENOWN IF YOU SHOULD PLAY BADLY

POSSESSED OF THE MOST CAPTIVATING GRACE AND EASE OF MANNER NOW INCLINED TO LANGUOROUS MELANCHOLY NOW SCINTILLATING WITH A JOYOUS VIVACITY THAT WAS CONTAGIOUS
HE EVOLVED FROM ITS MORE INTIMATE DOMAIN EFFECTS IN SYMPATHY WITH THOSE OF THE ORCHESTRA YET PURELY INDIVIDUAL HE ENRICHED IT WITH NEW MELODIC HARMONIC AND RHYTHMIC DEVICES ADAPTED TO ITSELF ALONE
TRUE ART SOFTENS THE HARSHEST ACCENTS OF SUFFERING BY PLACING SUPERIOR TO IT SOME ELEVATING IDEA SO IN THE MOST MELANCHOLY STRAINS OF HIS MUSIC ONE WHO HEEDS WELL MAY DETECT THE PRESENCE OF A LOFTY IDEAL
SO MANY AND SO ELOQUENT HAVE BEEN THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN OF HIS PLAYING IT IS EASY TO FANCY HIM SWEEPING THE IVORY KEYS WITH HIS GOSSAMER TOUCH THAT ENVELOPED WITH ETHEREAL BEAUTY
NO WONDER BALZAC MAINTAINED THAT IF CHOPIN SHOULD BUT DRUM ON THE TABLE HIS FINGERS WOULD EVOKE SUBTLE SOUNDING MUSIC AND WHAT AN EXAMPLE HE HAS LEFT FOR TEACHERS DELICATELY STRUNG AS HE WAS
TO THE AERIAL HEIGHTS HE HAD FOUND A VIVID PICTURE OF HIS METHOD OF TEACHING IS GIVEN IN THE LECTURES ON FREDERIC CHOPIN'S WORKS AND THEIR PROPER INTERPRETATION BY THE POLE JEAN KLECZYNSKI
THE BASIS OF THIS METHOD CONSISTED IN REFINEMENT OF TOUCH FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF WHICH A NATURAL EASY POSITION OF THE HAND WAS CONSIDERED BY CHOPIN A PRIME REQUISITE HE PREPARED EACH HAND WITH INFINITE CARE
HE NEVER HESITATED ABOUT PLACING IT ON A BLACK KEY WHEN CONVENIENT AND HAD IT PASSED BY MUSCLE ACTION ALONE IN SCALES AND BROKEN CHORDS WHOSE ZEALOUS PRACTICE IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF TOUCH ACCENT RHYTHM AND TONE
THE AIM IS NOT TO PLAY EVERYTHING WITH AN EQUAL SOUND BUT TO ACQUIRE BEAUTIFUL QUALITY OF TOUCH AND PERFECT SHADING OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN HIS EYES WAS A CLEAR ELASTIC SINGING TONE
AND HE KNEW HOW TO AUGMENT THE WARMTH AND RICHNESS OF TONE COLORING BY SETTING IN VIBRATION SYMPATHETIC HARMONICS OF THE PRINCIPAL NOTES THROUGH JUDICIOUS EMPLOYMENT OF THE DAMPER PEDAL
A MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN INVALUABLE TO STUDENTS AND MIGHT HAVE AVERTED MANY UNLUCKY MISAPPREHENSIONS OF HIMSELF AND HIS WORKS THOSE OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES WHO HAVE HARKENED WITH RAPTURE TO HIS PLAYING HAVE DECLARED THAT HE ALONE
SERENELY FANCYING THEY ARE HEEDING THE MASTER'S DESIGN RECKLESS OUT OF TIME PLAYING DISFIGURES WHAT IS MEANT TO EXPRESS THE FLUCTUATION OF THOUGHT THE SOUL'S AGITATION THE ROLLING OF THE WAVES OF TIME AND ETERNITY
CHOPIN WAS AT HIS BEST WHEN INTERPRETING MUSIC IN PRIVATE FOR A CHOICE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS OR PUPILS OR WHEN ABSORBED IN COMPOSITION IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY FOR HIM THAT HE USHERED IN A NEW ERA FOR HIS CHOSEN INSTRUMENT
BUT THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO THE MOST SEVERE TESTS BEFORE THEY WERE PERMITTED TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD EVERY INGENIOUS DEVICE THAT GAVE CHARACTER TO HIS EXQUISITE CANTILENA AND SOFTENED HIS MOST STARTLING CHORD PROGRESSIONS
THAT WE MAY WELL EXCLAIM WITH SCHUMANN HE IS THE BOLDEST PROUDEST POETIC SPIRIT OF THE TIME HIS GREATNESS IS HIS ARISTOCRACY SAYS OSCAR BIE HE STANDS AMONG MUSICIANS IN HIS FAULTLESS VESTURE
AS THE TOTAL OF GOODS SECURED NET INCOME IS THE REMAINDER AFTER DEDUCTING EXPENDITURES AND AFTER REPLACING THE GOODS EMPLOYED TO SECURE THE INCOME IN ORDER TO PRODUCE SOME GOODS TECHNICALLY
IT IS TRUE THAT EVERYTHING CALLED WEALTH IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE SOONER OR LATER IN SOME WAY TO THE SUM OF GRATIFICATIONS IT IS FOR THAT REASON IT IS CALLED WEALTH IT IS HOWEVER
IF IT IS PART OF THE SUM OF GOODS THAT FLOWS IN THAT IS NEWLY AVAILABLE FOR THE MAN'S USE IT IS INCOME BUT FUNDED INCOME IS THE MORE ABIDING FOR INCOME FROM WAGES STOPS
AND REDUCIBLE TO PSYCHIC INCOME SOME PORTIONS AT LEAST OF THE OBJECTIVE INCOMES OF GOODS ARE CONTINUALLY BY USE BECOMING SUBJECTIVE INCOMES OF ENJOYMENT
MEN TALK OF MATERIAL INCOME AS CONSISTING OF BUSHELS OF WHEAT HEAD OF CATTLE ET CETERA AND OF IMMATERIAL INCOME AS THE USES THAT DURABLE GOODS YIELD DIRECTLY
THE DISTINCTION LED TO SOME PECULIAR PUZZLES AND PARADOXES THE BARTENDER MIXING DRINKS ADDS TO THE VALUE OF THOSE INGREDIENTS IN A MINUTE THAT VALUE IS DISSIPATED
BUT A SIMILAR DISTINCTION IS INCONSISTENTLY PRESERVED BY MANY WRITERS IN THE CASE OF MATERIAL THINGS A BUILDING USED AS A FACTORY IS CALLED PRODUCTIVE
AND THUS HIS FELT DEPENDENCE ON GOODS EXTENDS OVER A SERIES OF FUTURE PRODUCTIVE AGENTS IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY THE PROBLEM WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THE ECONOMIC MAN AS LIVING ONLY IN AND FOR THE MOMENT
OF THE PRESENT MOMENT IS COMPARED WITH A GRATIFICATION OF A VERY DIFFERENT KIND AT A FUTURE TIME THE PROBLEM INVOLVED IS COMPLEX BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES IN TIME IN PLACE AND IN THE NATURE OF THE WANT GRATIFIERS
OTHER TRACTS LESS FERTILE OR FOR SOME REASON LESS AVAILABLE ARE DITCHED TILED AND DIKED AND FERTILIZERS ARE CARRIED UP STEEP HILLSIDES TO MAKE A SOIL UPON THE VERY CRAGS
THAT MAKE MACHINES STRONGER QUICKER AND BETTER THIS PROPOSITION IS NOT LOGICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PRECEDING A MACHINE IS AN ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL THINGS
THROUGH WHICH FORCE MAY BE INDIRECTLY APPLIED TO MOVE MATTER NO FAST LINE DIVIDES MACHINERY AS REGARDS FORM PURPOSE OR CAUSE OF VALUE FROM THE ARTIFICIALLY IMPROVED NATURAL AGENTS
THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING JUST AS A FIELD IS DRAINED PLOWED AND CULTIVATED TO FIT IT BETTER TO YIELD A CROP SO IS THE IRON ORE SHAPED INTO A FORM
IF THE QUALITY OR EFFICIENCY OF LOOMS IS DOUBLED IT IS AS IF THEIR NUMBER HAD GROWN IN LIKE PROPORTION IN ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION THE BEAST OF BURDEN MAY NOT ILLOGICALLY BE CLASSED WITH INANIMATE MACHINES
SO AS TO MAKE A MORE EFFICIENT AGENT AND MACHINES IN TURN MAY BE ADJUSTED AS PARTS OF A LARGER SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION THE IDEAL OF THE MODERN FACTORY SYSTEM IS SO TO ARRANGE THE MACHINERY
OR AS A BOX OF TOOTH PICKS READY FOR USE IN AN AMERICAN WATCH FACTORY ONE MAN TENDS TWELVE OR FIFTEEN AUTOMATIC MACHINES A SMALL BRASS ROD IS FED AUTOMATICALLY TO THE MACHINE
WHICH CAPTURE THE NATURAL FORCES OF THE WORLD PUT THEM INTO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MAKE THEM DO THE RIGHT THING OR WHICH GROUP AND RELATE THE MATERIALS OF THE WORLD IN THE RIGHT WAYS
AGENTS OF THE SAME KIND MAY DIMINISH IN NUMBER EITHER ABSOLUTELY OR RELATIVELY
BUT THE DISCOVERY THAT CERTAIN FIELDS PRODUCE A SUPERIOR QUALITY OF THE NETTLE USED FOR HECKLING CLOTH CAUSES THEM TO TAKE ON A NEW VALUE A MINERAL SPRING BECAUSE OF THE
ITS RENT RISES ALTHOUGH IT MAY CONTINUE TO TURN OUT THE SAME PRODUCT
MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL COST AT SUCH TIMES THE VALUE OF FACTORIES INCREASES GREATLY BUT AFTER A FEW YEARS OF PROSPERITY BUSINESS AGAIN COLLAPSES
SUCH PROSPEROUS PERIODS ARE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE BUSINESS MAN AND OF THE PROMOTER TO SELL THE FACTORY AT ITS HIGHEST PRICE MACHINERY ADAPTED ONLY FOR A SPECIAL PRODUCT
MORE ABNORMAL WILL BE THEIR TEMPORARY VALUE WHEN THEY ARE SUDDENLY NEEDED LAND NEAR THE SITE OF AN EXPOSITION TAKES ON A VERY
AND FAVORABLY LOCATED BUILDING SITES ILLUSTRATE THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN SOME CASES IT IS TRUE THE DEMAND MAY BE DUE TO SOME TEMPORARY CAUSE
ARE DERIVED FROM A RADICAL SIGNIFYING WHITE
FOR HIS HIGH PRIEST ALWAYS BORE HIS NAME BUT HE HIMSELF IS A PURE CREATION OF THE FANCY AND ALL HIS ALLEGED HISTORY IS NOTHING BUT A MYTH HIS EMBLEMATIC NAME THE BIRD SERPENT AND HIS REBUS AND CROSS AT
BUT I'VE A CHANCE TO DAY SO I WILL NOT LET IT PASS UNUSED WE ARE IN THE LAST CAMP RIGHT ON THE HUNTING GROUND IN THE MIDST OF THE FRAY WE HAVE SAID GOOD BYE TO DEAR ELIZABETH AND I MUST TELL YOU ABOUT HER BECAUSE SHE REALLY COMES FIRST
THE MOUNTAINS ON ONE SIDE WERE CRESTED GREAT CRAGS AND PILES OF ROCK CROWNED THEM AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE TIMBER GREW ONLY ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE TRUNKS OF THE QUAKING ASPENS SHONE SILVERY IN THE EARLY SUNLIGHT AND THEIR LEAVES WERE SHIMMERING GOLD
BEFORE I WAS THROUGH SCHOOL I WAS TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED BUT I LOST MY MOTHER JUST THEN AND WAS LEFT THE CARE OF MY PARALYTIC FATHER IF I HAD MARRIED THEN I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO TAKE FATHER FROM HIS FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS BECAUSE WALLACE CAME WEST IN THE FORESTRY SERVICE
I AM SO GLAD WE MET THEM SO WE DROVE ALONG TALKING TOGETHER WE EACH ASSURED THE GIRL OF OUR ENTIRE WILLINGNESS TO HAVE HER AS A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY AFTER A WHILE I GOT ON TO THE WAGON WITH MISTER STEWART AND TOLD HIM ELIZABETH'S STORY
HAPPINESS HAD TAKEN A NEW CLUTCH UPON MY HEART I LOOKED BACK EXPECTING TO SEE ELIZABETH ALL SMILES BUT IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME THE FOOLISH GIRL WAS SOBBING AS IF HER HEART WAS BROKEN MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY DREW HER HEAD DOWN UPON HER SHOULDER
MISTER STRUBLE HAS ALREADY KILLED A FINE SPIKE ELK FOR CAMP EATING WE CAMPED IN A BUNCH AND WE HAVE CAMP STOVES SO THAT IN CASE OF RAIN OR SNOW WE CAN STAY INDOORS JUST NOW WE HAVE A HUGE CAMP FIRE
BUT THEY ARE DELICIOUS YESTERDAY WE HAD PIE MADE OF WILD CURRANTS THERE ARE A POWERFUL LOT OF THEM HERE THERE IS ALSO A LITTLE BLUEBERRY THAT THE MEN SAY IS THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN HUCKLEBERRY THE GROUSE ARE FEEDING ON THEM
ALTOGETHER THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PLACES IMAGINABLE THE MEN ARE NOT VERY ANXIOUS TO BEGIN HUNTING A LITTLE DELAY MEANS COOLER WEATHER FOR THE MEAT IT IS COOL UP HERE BUT GOING BACK ACROSS THE DESERT IT WILL BE WARM FOR A WHILE YET STILL
NOT TO MENTION CARRYING THE HEAVY GUN THEY ARE USING THE LARGEST CALIBER SPORTING GUNS MURDEROUS LOOKING THINGS THAT IS ALL EXCEPT MISTER HARKRUDDER THE PICTURE MAN
WE HAD GONE TO BED BUT I COULDN'T REMAIN THERE SO I SAT ON THE WAGON SEAT WITH JERRINE BESIDE ME SOMETHING STRUCK THE GUY ROPES OF THE TENT AND I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WAS TOO WEAK TO CRY OUT I THOUGHT THE BIG TREE MUST HAVE FALLEN
THE SUN WAS WELL UP WHEN WE REACHED THE LITTLE PARK WHERE WE PICKETED OUR HORSES THEN CAME A LONG HARD CLIMB IT IS HARD CLIMBING AT THE BEST AND WHEN THERE IS A BIG GUN TO CARRY IT IS VERY HARD
WE COULD HEAR THE ROAR OF THE GROS VENTRE AS IT TUMBLED GRUMBLINGLY OVER ITS ROCKY BED TO OUR RIGHT ROSE MILE AFTER MILE OF RED CLIFFS AS THE LAST OF THE QUAKING ASP LEAVES HAVE FALLEN THERE WERE NO GOLDEN GROVES
WE HAD NOT FOLLOWED THEM FAR WHEN THREE COWS AND A SPIKE CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE PINES A LITTLE AHEAD OF US INSTANTLY MISTER HAYNES'S GUN FLEW TO HIS SHOULDER AND A DEAFENING REPORT JARRED OUR EARS HE RAN FORWARD
BUT I STOOD STILL FASCINATED BY WHAT I SAW OUR SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS BOUNDED BY A RIM OF ROCK OVER THE RIM WAS A SHEER WALL OF ROCK FOR TWO HUNDRED FEET TO WHERE THE GROS VENTRE WAS ANGRILY ROARING BELOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM
ROSE THE RED CLIFFS WITH THEIR JAGGED CRAGS AT THE REPORT OF THE GUN TWO HUGE BLOCKS OF STONE ALMOST AS LARGE AS A HOUSE DETACHED THEMSELVES AND FELL AT THE SAME INSTANT ONE OF THE QUAKING ASP GROVES
THE WHOLE HILLSIDE FELL INTO THE STREAM MISTER HAYNES CAME RUNNING BACK WHAT IS THE MATTER ARE YOU HURT WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HE ASKED I WAVED MY HAND WEAKLY TOWARD WHERE THE GREAT MOUND OF TANGLED TREES AND EARTH BLOCKED THE WATER
BUT THE ELK HAVE TO BE QUARTERED SO AS TO LOAD THEM ON TO A HORSE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY AND MISTER STRUBLE CAME OUT OF THE WOODS JUST THEN THEY HAD SEEN A BIG BUNCH OF ELK HEADED BY A SPLENDID BULL BUT GOT NO SHOT AND THE ELK WENT OUT OF THE PASS
THEY HAD HEARD OUR SHOT AND CAME ACROSS TO SEE WHAT LUCK WHAT IVER IS THE MATTER WITH YE ASKED MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MISTER HAYNES TOLD HER THEY HAD HEARD THE NOISE BUT HAD THOUGHT IT THUNDER MISTER HAYNES TOLD ME THAT IF I WOULD CHIRK UP
WE HAD ABOUT RESOLVED TO GO TO OUR HORSES WHEN WE HEARD A VOLLEY OF SHOTS THAT IS SOMEBODY BUNCH SHOOTING SAID MISTER STRUBLE THEY ARE IN BREWSTER LAKE PARK BY THE SOUND THAT MEANS THAT THE ELK WILL PASS HERE IN A SHORT TIME AND WE MAY GET A SHOT
SUPPER WAS READY BUT I WENT TO BED AT ONCE THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BUT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO STIFF AND SORE I COULD HARDLY MOVE AND SO TIRED I COULDN'T SLEEP NEXT MORNING MY JAW AND NECK WERE SO SWOLLEN
DIDN'T KNOW HE LIVED UP HERE HE HAD SEEN THE GAME WARDEN FROM WHOM SHE HAD PROCURED HER LICENSE AND SO HUNTED UP OUR CAMP HE IS AN ODD LOOKING INDIVIDUAL WITH SAD EYES AND A DROOPING MOUTH WHICH GIVES HIS FACE A MOST HOPELESS REPROACHFUL EXPRESSION
HIS NOSE HOWEVER SEEMS TO UPSET THE ORIGINAL PLAN FOR IT IS LONG AND THIN AND BENT SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE HIS NECK IS LONG AND HIS ADAM'S APPLE SEEMS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHERE IT BELONGS AT SUPPER JERRINE WATCHED IT
THE POND MY FRIEND ALDENHAM'S POND STANDS AT A CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND IS REACHED BY A WELL DRAINED GRAVEL PATH SO THAT IN ANY WEATHER ONE MAY WALK
WHEN THE POND BEGAN TO FILL TO STRANGERS THIS MAY SEEM SURPRISING AND IT IS ONLY FAIR TO TELL THEM THE GREAT SECRET WHICH IS THAT MUCH OF THE SURROUNDING LAND
FOR WHEN YOUR WHOLE DAY'S CRICKET HAS BEEN SPOILT IT IS PERFECTLY ABSURD
HAS DONE THE DAMAGE THE SOUL YEARNS FOR SOMETHING MORE STARTLING THAN THAT THE RECORD OF THE POND
WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WRITING A FEW LETTERS AFTER BREAKFAST MAY WHEN THEY HAVE FINISHED MEET THOSE WHO HAVE NO INTENTION OF WRITING ANY AND ARRANGE PLANS WITH THEM FOR THE MORNING
YET IF OUR HOSTESS WERE TO SEE US MARCHING OUT WITH AN UMBRELLA HOW ODD SHE WOULD THINK US WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO SHE WOULD ASK AND WE COULD ONLY ANSWER LAMELY
A HOUSEHOLD BOOK ONCE ON A TIME I DISCOVERED SAMUEL BUTLER NOT THE OTHER TWO BUT THE ONE WHO WROTE THE WAY OF ALL FLESH THE SECOND BEST NOVEL IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
WELL I DISCOVERED HIM JUST AS VOLTAIRE DISCOVERED HABAKKUK OR YOUR LITTLE BOY DISCOVERED SHAKESPEARE THE OTHER DAY AND I COMMITTED MY DISCOVERY TO THE WORLD
IN TWO GLOWING ARTICLES NOT UNNATURALLY THE WORLD REMAINED UNMOVED IT KNEW ALL ABOUT SAMUEL BUTLER LAST WEEK I DISCOVERED A FRENCHMAN
BUT I DARE NOT RISK IT THE THOUGHT OF YOUR SCORN AT MY PREVIOUS IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD FAMOUS TILLIER YOUR AMUSED CONTEMPT BECAUSE I HAVE ONLY JUST SUCCEEDED
OF A BOOK WHICH SHOULD BE A CLASSIC BUT IS NOT OF A BOOK OF WHICH NOBODY HAS HEARD UNLESS THROUGH ME IT WAS PUBLISHED SOME TWELVE YEARS AGO THE LAST PUBLISHED BOOK
OF A WELL KNOWN WRITER WHEN I TELL YOU HIS NAME YOU WILL SAY OH YES I LOVE HIS BOOKS AND YOU WILL MENTION SO AND SO AND ITS EQUALLY FAMOUS SEQUEL SUCH AND SUCH
WOULD PROBABLY PRETEND THAT HE HAD READ IT BUT HE WOULDN'T DECEIVE ME FOR ONE CANNOT RECOMMEND A BOOK TO ALL THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHOM ONE HAS MET IN TEN YEARS WITHOUT DISCOVERING
SOME OF THEM HAD NEVER HEARD OF KENNETH GRAHAME WELL ONE DID NOT HAVE TO MEET THEM AGAIN AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS TO MAKE A WORLD BUT MOST OF THEM WERE IN YOUR POSITION
FOR THEIR GRATITUDE NO DOUBT THEY ALSO SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS IN THEIR TURN AND IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT IT REACHED YOU IN THIS WAY BUT IT WAS TO ME
AN EXPLANATION WHICH SUSPICIOUS STRANGERS REQUIRE FROM ME SOMETIMES I SHALL NOT DESCRIBE THE BOOK FOR NO DESCRIPTION WOULD HELP IT BUT I SHALL JUST SAY THIS
TO EVERY NEW GUEST AND IS REGARDED AS THE TOUCHSTONE OF HIS WORTH BUT IT IS A BOOK WHICH MAKES YOU FEEL THAT THOUGH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE LOVES IT IT IS ONLY YOU
WHEN HE WROTE IT I HOPE THIS WILL PLEASE JONES WERE HIS FINAL WORDS AS HE LAID DOWN HIS PEN WELL OF COURSE YOU WILL ORDER THE BOOK AT ONCE
APRONED BEHIND THE COUNTER LOOK OUT FOR THE CURRANTS IN THE WINDOW AS YOU COME IN I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SOMETHING ARTISTIC IN THE WAY OF PATTERNS THERE BUT AS YOU LOVE ME DO NOT OFFER TO BUY ANY
AND TO SELL A MAN POTTED LOBSTER IS NOT TO HAVE OUR FINGERS ON HIS PULSE POTTED LOBSTER DOES NOT DEFINE A MAN ALL CUSTOMERS ARE ALIKE TO THE GROCER PROVIDED THEIR MONEY IS GOOD
YES AND HE WOULD KNOW WHO BOUGHT ALL HIS PAPERS AND BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS AND TO KNOW THIS IS TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
SUCH AS HAVE GUIDED MEN ALONG THE PATH OF TRUTH SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD FROM WHAT HO SHE BUMPS TO ICH DIEN AND MORE THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME
LET ARMAND'S BLOOD THEN BE ON HER OWN HEAD LET HER BE BRANDED AS HIS MURDERER LET EVEN HE WHOM SHE LOVED DESPISE AND LOATHE HER FOR THIS BUT GOD OH GOD SAVE HIM AT ANY COST WITH A WILD SHRIEK SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET AND DARTED ROUND THE ROCK
ARMAND ARMAND FOR GOD'S SAKE FIRE YOUR LEADER IS NEAR HE IS COMING HE IS BETRAYED ARMAND ARMAND FIRE IN HEAVEN'S NAME SHE WAS SEIZED AND THROWN TO THE GROUND SHE LAY THERE MOANING BRUISED NOT CARING BUT STILL HALF SOBBING HALF SHRIEKING
SOMETHING WAS THROWN OVER HER FACE SHE COULD NOT BREATHE AND PERFORCE SHE WAS SILENT THE BOLD SINGER TOO HAD BECOME SILENT WARNED NO DOUBT OF HIS IMPENDING DANGER BY MARGUERITE'S FRANTIC SHRIEKS THE MEN HAD SPRUNG TO THEIR FEET THERE WAS NO NEED FOR FURTHER SILENCE ON THEIR PART
AND YOU TOO CITOYEN HE ADDED TURNING WITH A SNARL TO DESGAS FOR DISOBEYING MY ORDERS YOU ORDERED US TO WAIT CITOYEN UNTIL THE TALL ENGLISHMAN ARRIVED AND JOINED THE FOUR MEN IN THE HUT NO ONE CAME SAID THE SERGEANT SULLENLY
WHICH WAY DID THEY GO ASKED CHAUVELIN I COULD NOT TELL CITOYEN SAID THE SERGEANT THEY WENT STRAIGHT DOWN THE CLIFF FIRST THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND SOME BOULDERS HUSH WHAT WAS THAT ALL THREE MEN LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
WITH A RAPID GLANCE CHAUVELIN NOTED ITS CONTENTS THE CAULDRON PLACED CLOSE UNDER AN APERTURE IN THE WALL AND CONTAINING THE LAST FEW DYING EMBERS OF BURNED CHARCOAL A COUPLE OF STOOLS OVERTURNED AS IF IN THE HASTE OF SUDDEN DEPARTURE
THEN THE FISHERMAN'S TOOLS AND HIS NETS LYING IN ONE CORNER AND BESIDE THEM SOMETHING SMALL AND WHITE PICK THAT UP SAID CHAUVELIN TO THE SERGEANT POINTING TO THIS WHITE SCRAP AND BRING IT TO ME
IT IS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE CITOYEN A FEARFUL SCRAWL I ORDERED YOU TO READ IT REPEATED CHAUVELIN VICIOUSLY THE SERGEANT BY THE LIGHT OF HIS LANTERN BEGAN DECIPHERING THE FEW HASTILY SCRAWLED WORDS
BUT THE LATTER HAD NOT WAITED AN INSTANT ONE PHRASE OF THE MOMENTOUS SCRAWL HAD CAUGHT HIS EAR
HIS WELL LAID PLAN HAD FAILED ITS SEQUEL WAS PROBLEMATICAL THERE WAS STILL A GREAT CHANCE NOW THAT THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL MIGHT YET ESCAPE AND CHAUVELIN WITH THAT UNREASONING FURY WHICH SOMETIMES ASSAILS A STRONG NATURE WAS LONGING TO VENT HIS RAGE ON SOMEBODY
BUT THE HARD VENGEFUL HEART OF HER BAFFLED ENEMY
HE CERTAINLY FELT EXCEEDINGLY VICIOUS AND SINCE HE HAD NO REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR VENTING HIS ILL HUMOUR ON THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD BUT TOO PUNCTUALLY OBEYED HIS ORDERS HE FELT THAT THE SON OF THE DESPISED RACE WOULD PROVE AN EXCELLENT BUTT
WITH TRUE FRENCH CONTEMPT OF THE JEW WHICH HAS SURVIVED THE LAPSE OF CENTURIES EVEN TO THIS DAY HE WOULD NOT GO TOO NEAR HIM BUT SAID WITH BITING SARCASM AS THE WRETCHED OLD MAN WAS BROUGHT IN FULL LIGHT OF THE MOON BY THE TWO SOLDIERS
YOUR HONOUR HE VENTURED IMPLORINGLY SINCE YOUR TERROR SEEMS TO HAVE PARALYZED YOUR TONGUE SAID CHAUVELIN SARCASTICALLY I MUST NEEDS REFRESH YOUR MEMORY
IT WAS AGREED BETWEEN US THAT IF WE OVERTOOK MY FRIEND THE TALL STRANGER BEFORE HE REACHED THIS PLACE YOU WERE TO HAVE TEN PIECES OF GOLD A LOW MOAN ESCAPED FROM THE JEW'S TREMBLING LIPS
HE DID NOT WAIT TO SEE HIS ORDERS CARRIED OUT HE KNEW THAT HE COULD TRUST THESE SOLDIERS WHO WERE STILL SMARTING UNDER HIS REBUKE NOT TO MINCE MATTERS WHEN GIVEN A FREE HAND TO BELABOUR A THIRD PARTY
AND CHAUVELIN CURSED NATURE CURSED MAN AND WOMAN AND ABOVE ALL HE CURSED ALL LONG LEGGED MEDDLESOME BRITISH ENIGMAS WITH ONE GIGANTIC CURSE THE HOWLS OF THE JEW BEHIND HIM UNDERGOING HIS PUNISHMENT SENT A BALM THROUGH HIS HEART
LEAVE HIM THERE SAID CHAUVELIN AND LEAD THE WAY NOW QUICKLY TO THE CART I'LL FOLLOW HE WALKED UP TO WHERE MARGUERITE LAY AND LOOKED DOWN INTO HER FACE
SHE HAD EVIDENTLY RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AND WAS MAKING FEEBLE EFFORTS TO RAISE HERSELF HER LARGE BLUE EYES WERE LOOKING AT THE MOONLIT SCENE ROUND HER WITH A SCARED AND TERRIFIED LOOK THEY RESTED WITH A MIXTURE OF HORROR AND PITY ON THE JEW
WITH MOCK GALLANTRY HE STOOPED AND RAISED HER ICY COLD HAND TO HIS LIPS WHICH SENT A THRILL OF INDESCRIBABLE LOATHING THROUGH MARGUERITE'S WEARY FRAME
WHAT HAD BECOME OF PERCY WHAT OF ARMAND SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AFTER SHE HEARD THE CHEERFUL SONG GOD SAVE THE KING WHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE THE SIGNAL OF DEATH I MYSELF CONCLUDED CHAUVELIN MUST NOW VERY RELUCTANTLY LEAVE YOU
EVERY TENET WILL BE ADOPTED THAT BEST SUITS THE DISORDERLY AFFECTIONS OF THE HUMAN FRAME CUSTOMERS WILL BE DRAWN TO EACH CONVENTICLE BY NEW INDUSTRY AND ADDRESS IN PRACTISING ON THE PASSIONS AND CREDULITY OF THE POPULACE
AND IN THIS MANNER ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS THOUGH COMMONLY THEY AROSE AT FIRST FROM RELIGIOUS VIEWS PROVE IN THE END ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE POLITICAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY
THE LARGE REVENUES PRIVILEGES IMMUNITIES AND POWERS OF THE CLERGY RENDERED THEM FORMIDABLE TO THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE AND ARMED WITH TOO EXTENSIVE AUTHORITY AN ORDER OF MEN WHO ALWAYS ADHERE CLOSELY TOGETHER
AND MAKE DEVOUT PEOPLE WILLING CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GRANDEUR AND RICHES OF THE COURT OF ROME THE CHURCH IT WAS SUPPOSED WAS POSSESSED OF A GREAT STOCK OF MERIT AS BEING ENTITLED TO ALL THE GOOD WORKS OF ALL THE SAINTS BEYOND WHAT WERE EMPLOYED IN THEIR OWN JUSTIFICATION
AND IN CONTRADICTION TO THE MULTIPLIED SUPERSTITIONS WITH WHICH THAT COMMUNION WAS LOADED THEY ADOPTED AN ENTHUSIASTIC STRAIN OF DEVOTION WHICH ADMITTED OF NO OBSERVANCES RITES OR CEREMONIES BUT PLACED ALL MERIT
AGAINST THE ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION THE LUTHERANS ADVANCED DOCTRINES FAVORABLE IN SOME RESPECT TO THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITY OF SOVEREIGNS THEY INVEIGHED AGAINST THE ABUSES OF THE COURT OF ROME
THE LIBERTINISM OF THE CLERGY AND POINTED OUT THEIR TREASURES AND REVENUES AS LAWFUL SPOIL TO THE FIRST INVADER AND AS THE ECCLESIASTICS HAD HITHERTO CONDUCTED A WILLING AND A STUPID AUDIENCE AND WERE TOTALLY UNACQUAINTED WITH CONTROVERSY MUCH MORE
WITH EVERY SPECIES OF TRUE LITERATURE THEY WERE UNABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST MEN ARMED WITH AUTHORITIES QUOTATIONS AND POPULAR TOPICS AND QUALIFIED TO TRIUMPH IN EVERY ALTERCATION OR DEBATE
AND BY THIS SINCERE AVOWAL HE GAVE OCCASION OF MUCH TRIUMPH TO THE LUTHERANS THIS PONTIFF ALSO WHOSE PENETRATION WAS NOT EQUAL TO HIS GOOD INTENTIONS WAS SEDUCED TO CONCUR IN THAT LEAGUE WHICH CHARLES AND HENRY HAD FORMED AGAINST FRANCE
AND WHO DREADED THE RESENTMENT OF THAT HAUGHTY MINISTER WAS SOLICITOUS TO REPAIR THE BREACH MADE IN THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY THIS INCIDENT
HE RENEWED TO WOLSEY ALL THE PROMISES WHICH HE HAD MADE HIM OF SECONDING HIS PRETENSIONS TO THE PAPAL THRONE
THE MORE TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH HENRY AND THE ENGLISH NATION HE GAVE TO SURREY ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND A COMMISSION FOR BEING ADMIRAL OF HIS DOMINIONS AND HE HIMSELF WAS INSTALLED KNIGHT OF THE GARTER AT LONDON
FROM HIS CRADLE TO HIS GRAVE A GALE OF THE BLANDEST PROSPERITY BORE HIM ALONG NOR DO I USE THE WORD PROSPERITY IN ITS MERE WORDLY OR EXTERNAL SENSE I MEAN IT AS SYNONYMOUS WITH HAPPINESS
WHAT HAS BEEN DEEMED THE MERE CHIMERA OF THE PERFECTIONISTS IN THE BRIEF EXISTENCE OF ELLISON I FANCY THAT I HAVE SEEN REFUTED THE DOGMA THAT IN MAN'S PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL NATURE LIES SOME HIDDEN PRINCIPLE
THE ANTAGONIST OF BLISS AN INTIMATE AND ANXIOUS EXAMINATION OF HIS CAREER HAS TAUGHT ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN GENERAL FROM THE VIOLATION OF A FEW SIMPLE LAWS OF HUMANITY ARISES THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MANKIND
BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS MY PRESENT OBJECT TO PEN AN ESSAY ON HAPPINESS THE IDEAS OF MY FRIEND MAY BE SUMMED UP IN A FEW WORDS HE ADMITTED BUT FOUR UNVARYING LAWS
ATTAINABLE BY OTHER MEANS THAN THIS IS SCARCELY WORTH THE NAME HE POINTED TO THE TILLERS OF THE EARTH THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO AS A CLASS ARE PROVERBIALLY MORE HAPPY THAN OTHERS
THERE WERE OF COURSE MANY SPECULATIONS AS TO THE MODE OF ITS DISPOSAL THE GIGANTIC MAGNITUDE AND THE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE NATURE OF THE SUM DAZZLED AND BEWILDERED ALL WHO THOUGHT UPON THE TOPIC
AND FIGURES BUT SUFFICED TO CONFOUND IT WAS SEEN THAT EVEN AT THREE PER CENT THE ANNUAL INCOME OF THE INHERITANCE AMOUNTED TO NO LESS THAN THIRTEEN MILLIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
OR IN THE NATURE OF HIS INTELLECT
AND IT WAS THIS BIAS PERHAPS WHICH IMPERCEPTIBLY LED HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS IF NOT THE SOLE LEGITIMATE FIELD FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT
WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE CREATION OF NOVEL MOODS OF PURELY PHYSICAL LOVELINESS THUS IT HAPPENED THAT HE BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET IF WE USE THIS LATTER TERM IN ITS EVERY DAY ACCEPTATION
WHICH NONE BUT THE IGNORANT DISPUTE THAT NO SUCH COMBINATIONS OF SCENERY EXIST IN NATURE AS THE PAINTER OF GENIUS HAS IN HIS POWER TO PRODUCE
IN ALL OTHER MATTERS WE ARE JUSTLY INSTRUCTED TO REGARD NATURE AS SUPREME WITH HER DETAILS WE SHRINK FROM COMPETITION WHO SHALL PRESUME TO IMITATE THE COLORS OF THE TULIP OR TO IMPROVE THE PROPORTIONS OF THE LILY OF THE VALLEY
THE CRITICISM WHICH SAYS OF SCULPTURE OR OF PORTRAITURE THAT NATURE IS TO BE EXALTED RATHER THAN IMITATED IS IN ERROR NO PICTORIAL OR SCULPTURAL COMBINATIONS OF POINTS
EACH INSULATED MEMBER OF THE FRATERNITY WILL SUGGEST THE IDENTICAL EMENDATION I REPEAT THAT IN LANDSCAPE ARRANGEMENTS OR COLLOCATIONS ALONE IS THE PHYSICAL NATURE SUSCEPTIBLE OF EXALTATION AND THAT
DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR WHICH HID FROM THE COMMON OBSERVER ARE REVEALED EVERYWHERE TO THE EXPERIENCED STUDENT OF NATURE THE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING
A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS PARTLY PLEASING TO THE EYE BY THE SHOW OF ORDER AND DESIGN AND PARTLY MORAL A TERRACE
WHAT IS SAID IN RESPECT TO THE DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR IS A MERE VAGUENESS OF SPEECH WHICH MAY MEAN MUCH OR LITTLE OR NOTHING
WE MAY BE INSTRUCTED TO BUILD AN ODYSSEY BUT IT IS IN VAIN THAT WE ARE TOLD HOW TO CONCEIVE A TEMPEST AN INFERNO A PROMETHEUS BOUND A NIGHTINGALE
IN ITS CHRYSALIS CONDITION OF PRINCIPLE AFFRONTED THEIR DEMURE REASON NEVER FAILS IN ITS MATURITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENT TO EXTORT ADMIRATION FROM THEIR INSTINCT OF THE BEAUTIFUL OR OF THE SUBLIME
IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF THE SCENES OF PURE NATURE THERE IS APPARENT THE ART OF A CREATOR YET IS THIS ART APPARENT ONLY TO REFLECTION IN NO RESPECT HAS IT THE OBVIOUS FORCE OF A FEELING
NOW IF WE IMAGINE THIS SENSE OF THE ALMIGHTY DESIGN TO BE HARMONIZED IN A MEASURABLE DEGREE IF WE SUPPOSE A LANDSCAPE WHOSE COMBINED STRANGENESS VASTNESS
THAT ELLISON THOUGHT TO FIND AND FOUND AN EXEMPTION FROM THE ORDINARY CARES OF HUMANITY
THE OTHER RETIRING BACKWARD AND BOWING WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS KNEES REPLIED INDEED INDEED I AM FILLED WITH ADMIRATION AT THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART WHEN I HEAR YOU SPEAK THUS I FEEL MORE THAN EVER HOW GREAT IS THE LOVE I BEAR YOU
NOW THE MAN WHO HAD RESCUED THE FOX'S CUB WAS A TRADESMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAD THREE OR FOUR AGENTS AND TWO MAID SERVANTS BESIDES MEN SERVANTS AND ALTOGETHER HE LIVED IN A LIBERAL MANNER HE WAS MARRIED AND THIS UNION HAD BROUGHT HIM ONE SON
PRAY INQUIRE CAREFULLY INTO THE MATTER WELL THIS IS VERY STRANGE FOUR NIGHTS AGO A MAN OF SOME FIVE OR SIX AND THIRTY YEARS OF AGE CAME WITH A VERBAL MESSAGE FROM YOU TO THE EFFECT THAT YOU HAD SENT HIM WITH A FOX'S LIVER
THE SAINTS WHO ARE WORSHIPPED IN JAPAN WRITES A NATIVE AUTHORITY ARE MEN WHO IN THE REMOTE AGES WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS DEVELOPING ITSELF WERE SAGES AND BY THEIR GREAT AND VIRTUOUS DEEDS HAVING EARNED THE GRATITUDE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS
IF ONLY THE REGION OF THE HEART AND ALL THE PULSES OF THE BODY BE ANOINTED WITH IT IT WILL FREE THE PATIENTS FROM THE EFFECTS OF ALL KINDS OF POISONS TAKEN BY THE MOUTH CORROSIVE ONES EXCEPTED DECOCTIONS OF EGYPTIAN MUMMIES WERE MUCH COMMENDED
YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE SO HE ROSE AND WENT OUT TO SEE WHO IT WAS AND THERE HE BEHELD AN OLD BADGER STANDING ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY ALARMED AT THE APPARITION
AFTER TWO HOURS THE BADGER TOOK ITS LEAVE WITH PROFUSE EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS AND WENT OUT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH IT CAME EVERY NIGHT TO THE HUT AS THE BADGER WOULD COLLECT AND BRING WITH IT DRIED BRANCHES AND DEAD LEAVES FROM THE HILLS FOR FIREWOOD
BEING SUCH AS I AM I HAVE NO DESIRE AND NO WISHES GLAD AS I AM TO HEAR YOUR KIND INTENTIONS THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN ASK YOU TO DO FOR ME YOU NEED FEEL NO ANXIETY ON MY ACCOUNT AS LONG AS I LIVE WHEN THE WINTER COMES
AS THIS SUBJECT WAS OFTEN RENEWED BETWEEN THEM THE PRIEST AT LAST TOUCHED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE BADGER'S HEART SAID SINCE I HAVE SHAVEN MY HEAD RENOUNCED THE WORLD AND FORSAKEN THE PLEASURES OF THIS LIFE I HAVE NO DESIRE TO GRATIFY
I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT IS ON MY MIND WHEN THE PRIEST HAD DONE SPEAKING THE BADGER LEANT ITS HEAD ON ONE SIDE WITH A PUZZLED AND ANXIOUS LOOK SO MUCH SO THAT THE OLD MAN WAS SORRY HE HAD EXPRESSED A WISH WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE THE BEAST TROUBLE
AND THE BADGER FEIGNING ASSENT TO WHAT THE PRIEST HAD IMPRESSED UPON IT RETURNED TO THE HILLS AS USUAL FROM THAT TIME FORTH THE BADGER CAME NO MORE TO THE HUT
THE PRIEST THOUGHT THIS VERY STRANGE BUT IMAGINED EITHER THAT THE BADGER STAYED AWAY BECAUSE IT DID NOT LIKE TO COME WITHOUT THE MONEY OR THAT IT HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL IT AND HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING ADDED TO HIS SINS FOR NO PURPOSE
IF THE MONEY WHICH YOU REQUIRED HAD BEEN FOR UNLAWFUL PURPOSES I COULD EASILY HAVE PROCURED AS MUCH AS EVER YOU MIGHT HAVE WANTED BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT IT WAS TO BE OFFERED TO A TEMPLE FOR MASSES FOR YOUR SOUL
THEN THE MIDDLE SON WENT HUNTING AND AS HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN A HARE SPRANG OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT
AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND BEGAN TO SHOUT DRAGON DRAGON COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME TO DAY
LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND TOSS YOU TO THE SKY BUT THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU STILL HIGHER
AND THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON A HIGH HILL WHENCE THEY COULD HAVE A GOOD VIEW WHEN THE SHEPHERD ARRIVED HE PUT THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP AND THE FALCON UPON IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME THAT WE MAY MEASURE OURSELVES ONCE MORE TOGETHER UNLESS YOU ARE A WOMAN THE DRAGON REPLIED I WILL DO SO PRINCE NOW NOW ERELONG BEHOLD THE DRAGON IT WAS LARGE IT WAS TERRIBLE
THEN HE SWUNG THE DRAGON AND TOSSED IT HIGH INTO THE AIR AND WHEN IT FELL TO THE GROUND IT BURST INTO PIECES BUT AS IT BURST INTO PIECES OUT OF IT SPRANG A WILD BOAR AND STARTED TO RUN AWAY BUT THE PRINCE SHOUTED TO HIS SHEPHERD DOGS
GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
SUBJECTS REFLECTING CONFUSEDLY ON MY MISFORTUNES AND THEIR CAUSE I WAS BEWILDERED IN A CLOUD OF WONDER AND HORROR THE DEATH OF WILLIAM THE EXECUTION OF JUSTINE
KNOW THAT ONE BY ONE MY FRIENDS WERE SNATCHED AWAY I WAS LEFT DESOLATE MY OWN STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED
MELANCHOLY FOLLOWED BUT BY DEGREES I GAINED A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MY MISERIES AND SITUATION AND WAS THEN RELEASED FROM MY PRISON FOR THEY HAD CALLED ME MAD AND DURING MANY MONTHS AS I UNDERSTOOD A SOLITARY CELL HAD BEEN MY HABITATION
MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
AND NEVER DEVIATING INTO INVECTIVE OR EXCLAMATION THE MAGISTRATE APPEARED AT FIRST PERFECTLY INCREDULOUS BUT AS I CONTINUED HE BECAME MORE ATTENTIVE AND INTERESTED
SINCE THE COMMISSION OF HIS CRIMES AND NO ONE CAN CONJECTURE TO WHAT PLACE HE HAS WANDERED OR WHAT REGION HE MAY NOW INHABIT I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOVERS NEAR THE SPOT WHICH I INHABIT
AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE
MY RAGE IS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNED LOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVE BUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TO HIS DESTRUCTION
MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
HEARD THE SILVER TONES OF MY ELIZABETH'S VOICE AND BEHELD CLERVAL ENJOYING HEALTH AND YOUTH OFTEN WHEN WEARIED BY A TOILSOME MARCH I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I WAS DREAMING UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD COME
AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAEMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN
THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE
AND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME IN SAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARY'S GIBE TO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM
AMIDST COLD THAT FEW OF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF A GENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE YET AT THE IDEA THAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT
MY HEART BOUNDED WITHIN ME BUT NOW WHEN I APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN GRASP OF MY FOE MY HOPES WERE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED AND I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM MORE UTTERLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SIGHT I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS AND BY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP
FRANK YOU TALK WITH HIM I'D BE APT TO GET SASSY IF HE SCOLDED TOO HARD SO IT USUALLY CAME ABOUT UPON FRANK'S SHOULDERS WAS LAID THE BURDEN OF EXTRICATING THEM FROM NUMEROUS MISHAPS BUT FRANK RATHER LIKED BEING MADE THE SCAPEGOAT
HE INSISTED STUBBORNLY AND THESE BOYS ADMIT THEY WERE CONNECTED WITH THE ROWDY CREW THAT MADE THEMSELVES A DISGRACE TO THE TOWN IN FRONT OF MY DOOR I SHALL EXPECT HIM TO FULFILL HIS OFFER WHICH YOU HEARD HIM MAKE MISTER JENKINS AND MISTER MOLE
CHANCES ARE WE'LL BE DROPPING IN TO SEE HOW OLD JESSE WILCOX IS GETTING ON WITH HIS MUSKRAT TRAPPING I THINK I'D ENJOY ANOTHER TURN UP THERE IN THE WOODS ONE THING SURE SAID FRANK WE MUST ARRANGE TO GO AWAY SOMEWHERE AND DO A LITTLE HUNTING AGAIN
I GOT CAUGHT THERE AND IT KEEPS ON BURNING LIKE A HOT IRON I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THERE WAS A PIECE OF COAL OR A STONE IN THAT BALL THEY MUST HAVE FIXED UP A LOT OF AMMUNITION THAT WAY BEFORE THEY TACKLED US SEEMS TO ME WILL'S A LONG TIME COMING OUT AGAIN COMPLAINED JERRY
CHAPTER SIXTEEN DID TEDDY KNOW WELL WOULDN'T THAT JAR YOU REMARKED BLUFF AS HE HEARD WHAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE BRIEF COMMUNICATION FROM THE LUMBERMAN TRIED TO BURN DOWN THE CAMP AT LUMBER RUN DID THEY BURST OUT JERRY
YES AND DIDN'T WE HEAR HIM THREATEN TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE LONG SO AS TO HIT BACK AT MISTER DARREL JERRY WANTED TO KNOW AS IF HE HAD ALL ALONG BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF THE BIG SPORTSMAN
YOU'VE GOT IT ABOUT STRAIGHT BLUFF FRANK ADMITTED OF COURSE I'M ONLY GUESSING ALL THIS REMEMBER
BLUFF ADMITTED AS TEDDY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE HUNG OUT AND COULDN'T FIND HIS WAY TO LUMBER RUN CAMP YOU CAN SEE THAT HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GOING BACK TO NACKERSON OR LOSING HIMSELF IN THE BIG WOODS
BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A FEELING OF DAMPNESS IN THE AIR FOR ALL IT'S SO COLD AND THE SUN YOU NOTICE SHINES THROUGH A SORT OF HAZY CURTAIN I THINK JUST THE SAME WAY YOU DO FRANK JERRY REMARKED AND IF YOU ASKED ME TO SAY WHEN
IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH HE HAD MET WITH NOTHING BUT SUCCESS SO FAR FRANK ADMITTED I HOPE HE GETS THAT PRIZE THE RAILROADS ARE OFFERING SO FAR AS I CAN TELL HE HAS A DANDY COLLECTION ALREADY AND WE'VE GOT SOME TIME AHEAD OF US STILL BY THE WAY WHERE IS WILL NOW ASKED BLUFF
INVOLUNTARILY STRETCHING OUT BOTH HANDS UNTIL HE HAD THEM WIDE APART HORNS WILL BLUFF FIRED AT HIM COWS HAVE HORNS DEER CARRY ANTLERS I SAID HORNS DIDN'T I ASSERTED THE OTHER WITH DETERMINATION
THAT NEAR THE CAMP IF ONLY YOU'LL HOLD YOUR HORSES UNTIL I CAN DEVELOP THIS FILM YOU SHALL SEE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER I KNOW A STAG FROM A BULL MOOSE HE WAS TOLD BY THE INDIGNANT PHOTOGRAPHER AS THE LATTER BROKE AWAY AND VANISHED INSIDE THE CABIN
AS THEY HURRIED OFF BUT NOT BEFORE BLUFF AND JERRY HAD DARTED INSIDE THE CABIN AND REAPPEARED CARRYING THEIR GUNS
WHY COULDN'T I HAVE TAKEN A NOTION TO STEP OUT HERE WITH WILL TO WATCH THE WAY HE TOOK THE PICTURES OF THAT SQUIRREL FAMILY I'D HAVE HAD MY GUN ACROSS MY KNEES WITH BUCKSHOT IN EVERY SHELL OF COURSE THINK HOW
I WASN'T THINKING SO MUCH OF THAT AS THE CHANCE OF A BLIZZARD COMING DOWN ON YOU FRANK CONTINUED BE SURE TO TAKE ALONG AN EXTRA SUPPLY OF MATCHES I'LL SEE TO IT THAT EACH OF YOU HAS SOMETHING TO HELP MAKE OUT A MEAL OR SO
THE THREE SOON REACHED THE CABIN IT CHANCED THAT JUST THEN THE CALL TO THE MIDDAY MEAL CAME WILL WAS TOO BUSY WORKING AT HIS DEVELOPING TANK TO SIT DOWN WITH THE REST PLENTY OF TIME WHEN I GET THROUGH WITH THIS HE TOLD THEM
GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES MORE TO GET THIS FILM IN FRESH WATER AND THEN I'LL COME BLUFF AND JERRY WERE HURRYING AS FAST AS THEY COULD FRANK HAD REDEEMED HIS PROMISE TO SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING PUT UP IN SMALL SHAPE THAT WOULD HELP OUT FOR SUPPER IN CASE THEY WERE DELAYED
I'M DONE EATING ANNOUNCED BLUFF COULDN'T CRAM ANOTHER BITE DOWN AFTER SEEING THAT PICTURE JERRY PROCLAIMED AS HE DARTED OVER TO THE CORNER WHERE HIS RIFLE STOOD AND BEGAN TO BUCKLE ON THE WEBBED BELT FILLED WITH CARTRIDGES
WE'RE NOT THE BABES IN THE WOODS YOU KNOW IF I DO SAY IT MYSELF WE'VE HAD OUR EYETEETH CUT FOR SOME TIME THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A BULLY CHANCE TO GET A BIG MOOSE AND WE WANT TO DO OUR LEVEL BEST LOOK FOR US WHEN WE COME
THEY WERE BLEEDING AT EVERY PORE UTTERLY WEARIED AND EXHAUSTED AND DESIROUS OF NOTHING BUT A LONG INTERVAL OF PEACE TO RECOVER THEIR LOST STRENGTH PRECISELY AT THIS MOMENT A NEW AND TERRIBLE ENEMY FELL UPON THE TWO WAR WORN COMBATANTS
AND DELIVERED AN ATTACK SO VEHEMENT THAT IT WAS DESTINED TO DESTROY THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF PERSIA AND TO SHEAR AWAY HALF THE PROVINCES OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
BY AN EXTRAORDINARY MIXTURE OF GENUINE ENTHUSIASM AND VULGAR CUNNING OF SELF DECEPTION AND DELIBERATE IMPOSTURE OF BENEVOLENCE AND CRUELTY OF AUSTERITY AND LICENCE HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF AND HIS CREED TO THE FRONT
THE TURBULENT POLYTHEISTS OF ARABIA HAD BY HIM BEEN CONVERTED INTO A COMPACT BAND OF FANATICS BURNING TO CARRY ALL OVER THE WORLD BY THE FORCE OF THEIR SWORDS THEIR NEW WAR CRY THAT
NEGLECTING THE THEOLOGICAL BENT OF HIS MESSAGE AND ONLY THINKING OF ENLISTING A POSSIBLE POLITICAL ALLY BOTH ANSWERS WERE REGARDED AS EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY BY THE PROPHET AND HE DOOMED THE TWO EMPIRES TO A SIMILAR DESTRUCTION
BOTH COUNTRIES WERE MUCH DISTRACTED WITH RELIGIOUS TROUBLES THE HERETICAL SECTS OF THE MONOPHYSITES AND JACOBITES WHO SWARMED WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES HAD LIFTED UP THEIR HEADS UNDER THE PERSIAN RULE BEING RELIEVED FROM THE GOVERNMENTAL REPRESSION THAT HAD HITHERTO BEEN THEIR LOT
THEY SEEM TO HAVE CONSTITUTED AN ACTUAL MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION AND BITTERLY RESENTED THE ENDEAVOURS OF HERACLIUS TO ENFORCE ORTHODOXY IN THE RECONQUERED PROVINCES THEIR DISCONTENT WAS SO BITTER
THE TALE OF THE INVASION HAD BEEN INTERTWINED WITH A WHOLE CYCLE OF ROMANTIC LEGENDS FITTER FOR THE ARABIAN NIGHTS
BROKE THEIR FIRM ARRAY WHEN A VICTORY SEEMED ALMOST ASSURED ALL THE MAILED HORSEMEN OF HERACLIUS
AND THE ROMAN ARMY WAS ROUTED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER THE TWO SUBSEQUENT CAMPAIGNS WERE EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL
STEPHANUS THRASHED AND STONED EVERY ONE WHO FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE ACTUALLY ADMINISTERED A WHIPPING TO THE EMPRESS DOWAGER DURING THE ABSENCE OF HER SON AND JUSTINIAN DID NOT PUNISH HIM WHEN HE RETURNED
AND RUSHING TO THE STATE PRISON AT THE HEAD OF A FEW FRIENDS BROKE IT OPEN AND LIBERATED SOME HUNDREDS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS A MOB JOINED HIM HE SEIZED THE CATHEDRAL OF SAINT SOPHIA
AND BANISHED HIM TO CHERSON THEODOTUS AND STEPHANUS HE HANDED OVER TO THE MOB WHO DRAGGED THEM ROUND THE CITY AND BURNT THEM ALIVE
A SPECIAL EXPEDITION WAS SENT BY SEA TO SACK CHERSON THE CITY OF THE EMPEROR'S EXILE BECAUSE HE HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST ITS CITIZENS THE CHIEF MEN WERE CAUGHT AND SENT TO THE CAPITAL WHERE JUSTINIAN HAD THEM BOUND TO SPITS AND ROASTED
WHOM THE SISTER OF THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS HAD BORNE TO HIM DURING HIS EXILE SO ENDED THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS AFTER IT HAD SAT FOR FIVE GENERATIONS AND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS ON THE THRONE OF CONSTANTINOPLE
IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS HE WAS UPSET BY A CONSPIRACY
AND EVERY YEAR THEIR RAVAGES PENETRATED FURTHER INLAND
AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS BEGUN TO CLOSE MONASTERIES WHOLESALE WE ARE TOLD THAT HE COMPELLED MANY OF THEIR INMATES TO MARRY BY FORCE OF THREATS OTHERS WERE EXILED TO CYPRUS BY THE HUNDRED NOT A FEW WERE FLOGGED AND IMPRISONED
AND TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE ONUS OF ENDING IT SO FAR AS ITALY WAS CONCERNED BY CREATING A NEW EMPEROR OF THE WEST
THIS LITTLE BOOK HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED WITH THE MAIN OBJECT OF SPREADING AS WIDELY AS POSSIBLE AMONG OUR PEOPLE YOUNG AND OLD A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIVILISATION AND GENERAL SOCIAL CONDITION OF IRELAND FROM THE FIFTH OR SIXTH
FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT PAGES IN TWENTY SEVEN CHAPTERS WITH TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN ILLUSTRATIONS TRAVERSES THE SAME GROUND AS THE LARGER WORK BUT BESIDES CONDENSATION MOST OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE QUOTATIONS AND NEARLY ALL THE REFERENCES TO AUTHORITIES ARE OMITTED
THE ORDINARY HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MANY AND THE READER HAS A WIDE CHOICE BUT IN THE MATTER OF OUR SOCIAL HISTORY HE HAS NO CHOICE AT ALL FOR THESE THREE BOOKS OF MINE HAVE FOR THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME
BROUGHT WITHIN THE REACH OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC A KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHOLE SOCIAL LIFE OF ANCIENT IRELAND P W J LYRE NA GRENA FEBRUARY
LADIES OFTEN DYED THE EYEBROWS BLACK WITH THE JUICE OF SOME SORT OF BERRY
IN NEARLY ALL THE FIGURES OF THE BOOK OF KELLS FOR EXAMPLE SEVENTH OR EIGHTH CENTURY THE HAIR IS COMBED AND DRESSED WITH THE UTMOST CARE SO BEAUTIFULLY ADJUSTED INDEED THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE ONLY BY SKILLED PROFESSIONAL HAIRDRESSERS
WHENEVER MEN ARE NOBLE THEY LOVE BRIGHT COLOUR
VARYING IN LENGTH BUT COMMONLY COVERING THE WHOLE PERSON FROM THE SHOULDERS DOWN THE PEOPLE ALSO WORE A TIGHT FITTING COAT WITH SLEEVES
A SHORT CAPE WAS OFTEN WORN ON THE SHOULDERS SOMETIMES CARRYING A HOOD TO COVER THE HEAD THE OUTER COVERING OF THE GENERAL RUN OF THE PEASANTRY WAS JUST ONE LOOSE SLEEVED COAT OR MANTLE
LIKE OTHER IRISH GARMENTS IT WAS GENERALLY STRIPED OR SPECKLED IN VARIOUS COLOURS LEGGINGS OF CLOTH OR OF THIN SOFT LEATHER WERE USED AND WERE LACED ON BY STRINGS TIPPED WITH WHITE BRONZE
THEY WORE RINGS AND BRACELETS OF VARIOUS SHAPES ON THE FINGERS INCLUDING THE THUMB ROUND THE WRIST AND FOREARM AND EVEN ROUND THE LEG ABOVE THE ANKLE
ALL OF WHICH MATERIALS WERE FOUND NATIVE THEY HAD TORQUES FOR THE NECK MADE OF TWISTED GOLD BARS AND THE ELABORATE AND IMMENSELY EXPENSIVE CRESCENTS OR GORGETS
THERE WAS A GOLD ORNAMENT A KIND OF OPEN RING WITH BOSSES OR BUTTONS ON THE ENDS
BUT WHEN MEN HEARD OF HIS COMING SO MIGHTY A CITY WAS CLUSIUM IN THOSE DAYS AND SO GREAT THE FAME OF KING PORSENNA
HE FLED FROM BEAUFORT NORTH CAROLINA THE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY IN ALL THE REGION OF COUNTRY WHENCE HENRY CAME EXHIBITED GENERALLY GREAT BRUTALITY AND CRUELTY
AROUSED HIM TO SEEK THEIR FREEDOM BY FLIGHT HE RESOLVED TO SPARE NO PAINS TO GIVE HIMSELF NO REST UNTIL THEY WERE BOTH FREE
THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE CHARLES AND MARGARET HAD LIVED AND BREATHED AND HAD THEIR EXISTENCE WAS HEAVILY OPPRESSED WITH SLAVERY NO EDUCATION FOR THE FREEMAN OF COLOR MUCH LESS FOR THE SLAVE
THE ORDER OF THE DAY WAS LITERALLY AS FAR AS COLORED MEN WERE CONCERNED NO RIGHTS WHICH WHITE MEN WERE BOUND TO RESPECT CHASKEY BROWN WM HENRY WASHINGTON JAMES ALFRED FRISLEY
IN ESCAPING HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE THEM BOTH
THESE WERE ALL GLADLY RECEIVED BY THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AND THE HAND OF FRIENDSHIP WARMLY EXTENDED TO THEM AND THE BEST OF COUNSEL AND ENCOURAGEMENT WAS OFFERED MATERIAL AID FOOD AND CLOTHING WERE ALSO FURNISHED AS THEY HAD NEED
BEING A YOUNG MAN OF PROMISE STEPHEN WAS ADVISED EARNESTLY TO APPLY HIS MIND TO SEEK AN EDUCATION AND TO USE EVERY POSSIBLE ENDEAVOR TO RAISE HIMSELF IN THE SCALE OF MANHOOD MORALLY RELIGIOUSLY AND INTELLECTUALLY
AND IN MAKING AN EFFORT TO REACH CANADA HE WAS QUITE WILLING TO SUFFER MANY THINGS SO THE FIRST CHANCE CHARLES GOT HE STARTED AND PROVIDENCE SMILED UPON HIS RESOLUTION
AND THIS WAS WHAT MADE CHARLES UNHAPPY UNEDUCATED AS HE WAS HE WAS TOO SENSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT WEBSTER HAD ANY GOD GIVEN RIGHT TO HIS MANHOOD CONSEQUENTLY HE LEFT BECAUSE HIS MASTER DID NOT TREAT HIM RIGHT
ALL BAKERS USING THREE OR MORE BARRELS OF FLOUR A MONTH HAVE BEEN LICENSED AND SO ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION THIS MEANS PRACTICALLY ALL THE COMMERCIAL BAKERS OF THE COUNTRY
UNTIL THE WHEAT SUPPLY INCREASES AND THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION LESSENS RESTRICTIONS USE NO WHEAT AT ALL IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN MAKE DELICIOUS MUFFINS AND OTHER QUICK BREADS FROM THE SUBSTITUTE FLOURS
RATIONS ARE NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THE AMOUNT MENTIONED WILL BE FORTHCOMING THEY ONLY PERMIT ONE TO HAVE IT IF IT CAN BE OBTAINED
WITH HIS WOODEN LEG INLAID WITH SILVER A LITTLE IN ADVANCE IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN HIS POSITION HIS RIGHT HAND GRASPING A GOLD HEADED CANE HIS LEFT RESTING UPON THE PUMMEL OF HIS SWORD HIS HEAD DRESSING SPIRITEDLY TO THE RIGHT
GUZZLING DEEP DRINKING SWASHBUCKLERS WHO MADE THE WILD WOODS RING WITH THEIR CAROUSALS NO SOONER DID THIS ROBUSTIOUS COMMANDER HEAR OF THE ERECTION OF FORT CASIMIR THAN HE SENT A MESSAGE TO VAN POFFENBURGH
FROM THE MANHATTOES AS WITNESS THE BREECHES OF THEIR LAND MEASURER TEN BROECK TO THIS THE GOVERNOR REJOINED THAT THE LAND HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SOLD BY THE INDIANS TO THE SWEDES AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS UNDER THE PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT
AND WHICHEVER HAD THE WIND IN ITS FAVOR WOULD KEEP UP A CONTINUAL FIRING OF CANNON TO TAUNT ITS ANTAGONIST WITH THE SMELL OF GUNPOWDER ON ALL THESE POINTS OF WINDY WARFARE THE ANTAGONISTS WERE WELL MATCHED
BUT SO IT HAPPENED THAT THE SWEDISH FORTRESS BEING LOWER DOWN THE RIVER ALL THE DUTCH VESSELS BOUND TO FORT CASIMIR WITH SUPPLIES HAD TO PASS IT
DAILY FAILING THEM AT LENGTH THE SUMMER HEATS AND SUMMER SHOWERS SET IN AND NOW LO AND BEHOLD A GREAT MIRACLE WAS WROUGHT FOR THE RELIEF OF THE NEDERLANDS
SUCH WAS THE FAMOUS MOSQUITO WAR ON THE DELAWARE OF WHICH GENERAL VAN POFFENBURGH WOULD FAIN HAVE BEEN THE HERO BUT THE DEVOUT PEOPLE OF THE NIEUW NEDERLANDS ALWAYS ASCRIBED THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE SWEDES
SEEMED AS IF HE HAD CEASED TO BE A SOLDIER AS IF HE WERE NO LONGER AN OFFICER BELONGING TO THE PALACE BUT WAS ON THE CONTRARY A QUIET EASY GOING CITIZEN IN A STATE OF STAGNATION BETWEEN HIS DINNER AND SUPPER OR BETWEEN HIS SUPPER AND HIS BED
AND YET PLANCHET FANCIED THAT IN TOKEN OF TACIT APPROVAL HE SAW HIM IMPERCEPTIBLY SMILE AT THE WORD STUPID THIS EMBOLDENED HIM TO SAY ARE YOU ASLEEP MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN NO PLANCHET I AM NOT EVEN ASLEEP REPLIED THE MUSKETEER
PLANCHET YOU KNOW THAT I AM NEVER BORED EXCEPT TO DAY AND THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY BAH MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN IT IS A WEEK SINCE YOU RETURNED HERE FROM FONTAINEBLEAU
HE WAS A CLEVER FELLOW ALTHOUGH OF A VERY ODD COMPLEXION WHICH WAS THE SAME COLOR AS YOUR OLIVES WELL THIS ARAB WHENEVER HE HAD DONE EATING OR WORKING USED TO SIT DOWN TO REST HIMSELF
IT IS IN MY OPINION VERY ABSURD MY OWN UNDOUBTED PREFERENCE BEING FOR MY BED AND IF YOU ARE NOT OF MY OPINION IT IS SIMPLY AS I HAVE ALREADY HAD THE HONOR OF TELLING YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE BORING YOURSELF TO DEATH PLANCHET
RECEIVED PORTHOS WITH RESPECT MINGLED WITH THE TENDEREST CORDIALITY PORTHOS WHO WAS A LITTLE COLD AND STIFF IN HIS MANNERS AT FIRST ON ACCOUNT OF THE SOCIAL DIFFERENCE EXISTING AT THAT PERIOD BETWEEN A BARON AND A GROCER SOON BEGAN TO SOFTEN WHEN HE PERCEIVED SO MUCH GOOD FEELING
AND INTO THE DRAWERS FULL OF SWEETMEATS
I SHOULD LIKE TO PASS YOU MONSIEUR IF IT IS NOT TROUBLING YOU TOO MUCH VERY WELL SAID PORTHOS IT DOES NOT TROUBLE ME IN THE LEAST AT THE SAME MOMENT HE TOOK HOLD OF THE YOUNG FELLOW BY THE WAISTBAND LIFTED HIM OFF THE GROUND AND PLACED HIM VERY GENTLY ON THE OTHER SIDE
SO MUCH THE BETTER YOU OVERWHELM ME MONSIEUR LE BARON THE MONSIEUR LE BARON HAD A GREAT EFFECT UPON THE MEN WHO DETECTED A PERSONAGE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY IN AN APPETITE OF THAT KIND THIS TITLE TOO REASSURED THEM
WHICH MADE THE ANIMAL'S LEGS ALMOST GIVE WAY D'ARTAGNAN BURST OUT LAUGHING AS HE SAID TAKE CARE PLANCHET
AND I WAS ONLY SAYING THIS VERY MORNING TO D'ARTAGNAN HOW MUCH I REGRETTED HIM BUT TELL ME PLANCHET THANK YOU MONSIEUR LE BARON THANK YOU GOOD LAD GOOD LAD HOW MANY ACRES OF PARK HAVE YOU GOT OF PARK
NEARLY AS BEAUTIFUL AS MY FOREST AT BERRY PLANCHET OPENED HIS EYES VERY WIDE
WHICH IN THESE PEACEFUL TIMES IS FOR ME A SUFFICIENTLY PLEASING PICTURE OF WAR ON A SMALL SCALE
ON SECOND THOUGHTS HE TOOK HOLD OF HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND LED IT ABOUT THIRTY PACES FURTHER ON HIS TWO COMPANIONS FOLLOWING HIM HE THEN ADVANCED ABOUT ANOTHER THIRTY PACES UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF A CART HOUSE LIGHTED BY AN IRON GRATING AND LIFTING UP A WOODEN LATCH PUSHED OPEN ONE OF THE FOLDING DOORS
HE ENTERED FIRST LEADING HIS HORSE AFTER HIM BY THE BRIDLE INTO A SMALL COURTYARD WHERE AN ODOR MET THEM WHICH REVEALED THEIR CLOSE VICINITY TO A STABLE THAT SMELLS ALL RIGHT SAID PORTHOS LOUDLY GETTING OFF HIS HORSE AND I ALMOST BEGIN TO THINK
AND HER EYES HALF CLOSED PURRING IN THAT SIGNIFICANT MANNER WHICH ACCORDING TO FELINE HABITS INDICATES PERFECT CONTENTMENT
AT THE SOUND OF THIS GIGANTIC VOICE THE CAT TOOK FLIGHT
INTRODUCED HIS TWO COMPANIONS INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE TABLE WAS ALREADY LAID PERMIT ME MY DEAR HE SAID TO PRESENT TO YOU MONSIEUR LE CHEVALIER D'ARTAGNAN MY PATRON
SHE RAN AWAY FROM A BRUTE OF A HUSBAND WHO WAS IN THE HABIT OF BEATING HER BEING MYSELF A PICARD BORN I WAS ALWAYS VERY FOND OF THE ARTESIAN WOMEN AND IT IS ONLY A STEP FROM ARTOIS TO FLANDERS
RECOMMENDED A NEW DESCENT INTO THE CELLAR AND AS PLANCHET NO LONGER WALKED WITH THE STEADINESS OF A WELL TRAINED FOOT SOLDIER
THEY SET OFF HUMMING SONGS WILD ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE LISTENING
D'ARTAGNAN WHOM NOTHING EVER ESCAPED REMARKED HOW MUCH REDDER TRUCHEN'S LEFT CHEEK WAS THAN HER RIGHT
NO ONE IN THE HOUSE WAS CAPABLE OF TAKING THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE
TOOK BOTH HIS FRIENDS BY THE HAND I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU OVER THE HOUSE HE SAID
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A REPRESENTATION NOW FOR I THINK I HEARD SOMETHING LIKE CHANTING YES SAID D'ARTAGNAN I HEAR SINGING TOO
NO NO ONE SEEMS TO BE FOLLOWING THE COFFIN YES SAID PORTHOS I SEE A MAN
AND IS A WOMAN OF HIGH RANK IN SOCIETY I OUGHT TO KNOW THAT FIGURE AND PECULIAR STYLE OF WALK AS HE RAN THE SOUND OF HIS SPURS AND OF HIS BOOTS UPON THE HARD GROUND OF THE STREET MADE A STRANGE JINGLING NOISE A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE IN ITSELF
WHICH HE WAS FAR FROM RECKONING UPON THE NOISE DISTURBED THE LADY SHE SEEMED TO FANCY SHE WAS BEING EITHER FOLLOWED OR PURSUED WHICH WAS INDEED THE CASE AND TURNED ROUND
DARING A THOUSAND DANGERS FOR THE SAKE OF THE STRAW PACKED BOTTLES THEY CARRIED SEA BRONZED MEN WITH HARD FLAT MUSCLES AND FEARLESS EYES READY GUNS SLAPPING THEIR THIGHS AS THEY
IF IT WEREN'T URGENT I WOULDN'T BE CALLING YOU YOU KNOW WILL YOU COME YOU BET I SAID QUICKLY FEELING RATHER A FOOL FOR RAGGING HIM WHEN HE WAS IN SUCH DEADLY EARNEST HAVE THE RECEIVER SNAPPED AND CRACKLED
USUALLY THE VERY SOUL OF COURTESY AND CONSIDERATION
AS I CLAMPED ON MY BRAKES A SWIFT SHADOW PASSED TWO OF THE LOWER WINDOWS BEFORE I COULD LEAP FROM THE CAR THE BROAD FRONT DOOR WITH ITS ROUNDED TOP AND CIRCULAR GRILLED WINDOW WAS FLUNG WIDE AND MERCER CAME RUNNING TO MEET ME
MERCER HE LAUGHED EXCITEDLY YOU'LL SEE YOU'LL SEE NO I'M NOT IN LOVE AND I WANT YOU TO HELP AND NOT ADMIRE THERE ARE ONLY CARSON AND MYSELF HERE YOU KNOW AND THE JOB'S TOO BIG FOR THE TWO OF US
MERCER DURING ALL THE YEARS I HAD KNOWN HIM HAD NEVER BEEN MOVED BEFORE TO SUCH TEMPESTUOUS OUTBURSTS OF ENTHUSIASM IT WAS HIS HABIT TO SPEAK SLOWLY AND THOUGHTFULLY IN HIS LOW MUSICAL VOICE EVEN IN THE MIDST OF OUR HOTTEST ARGUMENTS AND WE HAD HAD MANY OF THEM
WAS THE EMPTY BLACKNESS OF THE SKY NONE OF THE LIGHTS PROVIDED FOR THE ILLUMINATION OF THE COVERED PATIO WAS TURNED ON BUT ALL THE WINDOWS SURROUNDING THE PATIO WERE AGLOW AND I COULD SEE THE POOL QUITE CLEARLY THE POOL AND ITS OCCUPANT
I TRIED TO LOOK AWAY AND FOUND MYSELF UNABLE TO MOVE I FELT MERCER'S TENSE SUDDEN GRIP UPON MY ARM BUT I DID NOT COULD NOT LOOK AT HIM SHE SHE'S SMILING I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM
I WALKED ALONG BRISKLY FOR PERHAPS FIVE MINUTES
SHE WAS LAYING FACE DOWN IN THE WATER MOTIONLESS HER HEAD TOWARDS THE SEA ONE ARM STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HER AND HER LONG HAIR WRAPPED AROUND HER LIKE A HALF TRANSPARENT CLOAK I RAN UP AND LIFTED HER FROM THE WATER HER BODY WAS COLD AND DEATHLY WHITE
AND IN THAT WHITE BATHING SUIT YES I BELIEVE SHE'S TAKEN A FANCY TO YOU MERCER'S EYES WERE DANCING IF SHE HAS HE WENT ON IT'LL MAKE OUR WORK VERY EASY WHAT WORK I ASKED SUSPICIOUSLY
I THINK I HAVE WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH PERFECTED EXPERIMENTALLY HE EXPLAINED RAPIDLY I FELL ASLEEP WORKING ON IT AT THREE O'CLOCK OR THEREABOUTS THIS MORNING AND SOME TESTS WITH CARSON SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IT IS A SUCCESS
IF IT WILL WORK ON HER AND WE CAN DIRECT HER THOUGHTS WE CAN FIND OUT HER HISTORY THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE WE'LL ADD A PAGE TO SCIENTIFIC HISTORY A WHOLE BIG CHAPTER THAT WILL MAKE US FAMOUS MAN THIS IS SO BIG IT'S SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET
LOOK AND HE HELD OUT A THIN ARISTOCRATIC BROWN HAND BEFORE MY EYES A HAND THAT SHOOK WITH NERVOUS EXCITEMENT I DON'T BLAME YOU I SAID QUICKLY
LET'S GET BUSY WHAT CAN I DO MERCER REACHED AROUND THE DOOR INTO THE LABORATORY AND PRESSED A BUTTON FOR CARSON HE EXPLAINED WE'LL NEED HIS HELP IN THE MEANTIME WE'LL LOOK OVER THE SET UP THE APPARATUS IS STREWN ALL OVER THE PLACE
WITH THIN BLACK FINGERS THAT PULSED AND TREMBLED BEHIND THE PANEL WAS A TALL CYLINDER WOUND WITH SHINING COPPER WIRE AND BESIDE IT ANOTHER PANEL UPRIGHT FAIRLY BRISTLING WITH KNOBS CONTACT POINTS POTENTIOMETERS RHEOSTATS AND SWITCHES
THE WORDS WERE NOT SPOKEN I DID NOT HEAR THEM I KNEW THEM WHAT I GLANCED AT MERCER AND HE LAUGHED ALOUD WITH PLEASURE AND EXCITEMENT IT WORKED HE CRIED
I RECEIVED YOUR THOUGHT REGARDING CARSON AND THEN TURNED THE SWITCH SO THAT YOU RECEIVED MY THOUGHT AND YOU DID RATHER GINGERLY I REMOVED THE THING FROM MY HEAD AND LAID IT ON THE TABLE IT'S WIZARDRY MERCER IF IT WILL WORK AS WELL ON HER IT WILL I KNOW IT WILL
THE OTHER TWO RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON THE FIRST CONTACT NUMBER ONE SENDS AND NUMBERS TWO AND THREE RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON NUMBER TWO THEN HE SENDS THOUGHTS AND NUMBERS ONE AND THREE RECEIVE THEM AND SO ON
SHE WAS SUCH A SLIM GRACEFUL ALMOST DELICATE LITTLE THING THE THOUGHT THAT THREE STRONG MEN MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL HER SEEMED ALMOST AMUSING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN ACTION YET SAID MERCER GRIMLY
NO MEAN FEAT UNDER WATER SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN HER EYES FIXED ON MINE
I'VE ALREADY STARTED HE CALLED BACK AND I HURRIEDLY DONNED MY OWN INSTRUMENT
I WAS AWARE OF THE SOFT LITTLE TICK IN THE CENTER OF MY BRAIN THAT ANNOUNCED THAT THE SWITCH HAD BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER CONTACT POINT I GLANCED DOWN AT HER SHE WAS STARING UP AT ME WITH HER GREAT CURIOUS EYES
A DIM BLUISH LIGHT FILTERED DOWN ON A SCENE SUCH AS MORTAL EYES HAVE NEVER SEEN ALL AROUND WERE STRANGE STRUCTURES OF JAGGED CORAL ROUGHLY CIRCULAR AS TO BASE AND ROUNDED ON TOP RESEMBLING VERY MUCH THE IGLOOS OF THE ESKIMOS
OR AT TIMES SHOT OVERHEAD LIKE VERITABLE TORPEDOES THERE WERE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN MOVING THERE THE MEN WERE BROADER OF SHOULDER AND THEIR HAIR WHICH THEY WORE TO THEIR KNEES WAS SOMEWHAT DARKER IN COLOR THAN THAT OF THE WOMEN BOTH SEXES WERE SLIM
THE CLINGING TRESSES WERE CINCTURED AT THE WAIST WITH A SORT OF CORD OF TWISTED ORANGE COLORED MATERIAL AND SOME OF THE YOUNGER WOMEN WORE BANDS OF THE SAME MATERIAL AROUND THEIR BROWS NEAREST OF ALL THE FIGURES WAS THE GIRL WHO WAS VISUALIZING ALL THIS FOR US
THE WHITE FIGURE OF THE GIRL SHOT ONWARD THROUGH THE SCARLET FLOOD BLINDED SHE DID NOT SEE THAT THE JUTTING RIBS OF THE ANCIENT SHIP WERE IN HER PATH I SEEMED TO SEE HER CRASH HEAD ON INTO ONE OF THE MASSIVE TIMBERS
AND I CRIED OUT INVOLUNTARILY AND GLANCED DOWN AT THE GIRL IN THE WATER AT MY FEET HER EYES WERE GLOWING SHE KNEW THAT I HAD UNDERSTOOD HAZILY THEN I SEEMED TO VISUALIZE HER BODY FLOATING LIMPLY IN THE WATER IT WAS ALL VERY VAGUE AND INDISTINCT
HER GREAT WEIRDLY BLUE EYES SEEMED TO BORE INTO MY BRAIN I COULD FEEL THEM THROBBING THERE I FORGOT TIME AND SPACE I SAW ONLY THAT PALE SMILING FACE AND THOSE GREAT DARK EYES
MERCER WAS BENDING OVER ME SPEAKING SOFTLY I WAS WATCHING OLD MAN HE SAID GENTLY I CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED A MOMENTARY PSYCHIC FUSING OF AN ANCIENT LONG SINCE BROKEN LINK YOU TOGETHER WITH ALL MANKIND CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA
I ASKED HESITANTLY I BELIEVE REPLIED MERCER THAT SHE CAN GIVE US THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE IF WE CAN ONLY MAKE HER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WISH GOD IF WE ONLY COULD
AND WHICH LAY AT THAT TIME UNDER PROROGATION BUT BEING TOLD THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD APPEAR UNUSUAL HE ISSUED WRITS FOR SUMMONING A NEW PARLIAMENT ON THE SEVENTH OF MAY AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA
UNEXPERIENCED AND IMPOLITIC REGARDED AS SINCERE ALL THE PRAISES AND CARESSES WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN LOADED WHILE ACTIVE IN PROCURING THE RUPTURE WITH THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AND BESIDES THAT HE LABORED UNDER GREAT NECESSITIES
THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT THE PRESENT WAR WAS VERY LATELY THE RESULT OF THEIR OWN IMPORTUNATE APPLICATIONS AND ENTREATIES AND THAT THEY HAD SOLEMNLY ENGAGED TO SUPPORT THEIR SOVEREIGN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF IT
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONDUCTED BY THE WISEST AND ABLEST SENATORS THAT HAD EVER FLOURISHED IN ENGLAND THOUGHT PROPER TO CONFER ON THE KING A SUPPLY OF TWO SUBSIDIES
THE LAST PARLIAMENT OF JAMES AMIDST ALL THEIR JOY AND FESTIVITY HAD GIVEN HIM A SUPPLY VERY DISPROPORTIONED TO HIS DEMAND AND TO THE OCCASION AND AS EVERY HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH WAS ELECTED DURING FORTY YEARS
THE NATION WAS VERY LITTLE ACCUSTOMED AT THAT TIME TO THE BURDEN OF TAXES AND HAD NEVER OPENED THEIR PURSES IN ANY DEGREE FOR SUPPORTING THEIR SOVEREIGN EVEN ELIZABETH NOTWITHSTANDING HER VIGOR AND FRUGALITY
OF REDUCING THE PREROGATIVE WITHIN MORE REASONABLE COMPASS THOUGH THEIR ANCESTORS HAD BLINDLY GIVEN WAY TO PRACTICES AND PRECEDENTS FAVORABLE TO KINGLY POWER AND HAD BEEN ABLE NOTWITHSTANDING TO PRESERVE SOME SMALL REMAINS OF LIBERTY
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THEY THOUGHT WHEN ALL THESE PRETENSIONS WERE METHODISED AND PROSECUTED BY THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGE TO MAINTAIN ANY SHADOW OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SUCH UNLIMITED AUTHORITY IN THE SOVEREIGN
AN ABATEMENT OF THE MORE RIGOROUS LAWS WAS ALL HE INTENDED AND HIS ENGAGEMENTS WITH FRANCE NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THEIR REGULAR EXECUTION HAD NEVER BEEN PROMISED OR EXPECTED REQUIRED OF HIM SOME INDULGENCE
AND WHICH THEY SANCTIFIED BY THE MOST MELANCHOLY INDOLENCE IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT THE DIFFERENT APPELLATIONS OF THIS FESTIVAL WERE AT THAT TIME KNOWN SYMBOLS OF THE DIFFERENT PARTIES
THE ARMY WAS LANDED AND A FORT TAKEN BUT THE UNDISCIPLINED SOLDIERS FINDING STORE OF WINE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM THE UTMOST EXCESSES FURTHER STAY APPEARING FRUITLESS THEY WERE REEMBARKED AND THE FLEET PUT TO SEA
WAS OBLIGED AGAIN TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A PARLIAMENT THOUGH THE ILL SUCCESS OF HIS ENTERPRISES DIMINISHED HIS AUTHORITY AND SHOWED EVERY DAY MORE PLAINLY THE IMPRUDENCE OF THE SPANISH WAR THOUGH THE INCREASE OF HIS NECESSITIES
THE SUPPLY WAS ONLY VOTED BY THE COMMONS THE PASSING OF THAT VOTE INTO A LAW WAS RESERVED TILL THE END OF THE SESSION A CONDITION WAS THEREBY MADE IN A VERY UNDISGUISED MANNER WITH THEIR SOVEREIGN
BUT HIS URGENT NECESSITIES OBLIGED HIM TO SUBMIT
BUT FINDING THEM ALL FRUITLESS AND OBSERVING CHARLES TO BE ENTIRELY GOVERNED BY BUCKINGHAM HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMY HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO KEEP ANY MEASURES WITH THE COURT A NEW SPIRIT HE SAW AND A NEW POWER ARISING IN THE NATION
NOTHING LESS THAN FATAL EXPERIENCE COULD ENGAGE THE ENGLISH PRINCES TO PAY A DUE REGARD TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THAT FORMIDABLE ASSEMBLY THE EARL OF SUFFOLK CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE DYING ABOUT THIS TIME
DROPPED FROM THESE MEMBERS UPON INQUIRY IT APPEARED THAT NO SUCH EXPRESSIONS HAD BEEN USED THE MEMBERS WERE RELEASED AND THE KING REAPED NO OTHER BENEFIT FROM THIS ATTEMPT THAN TO EXASPERATE THE HOUSE STILL
HE TOO EITHER FROM VANITY OR POLITICS HAD VENTURED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN BUT A PRIEST PAST MIDDLE AGE OF A SEVERE CHARACTER AND OCCUPIED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION OR VENGEANCE
CONTRARY TO THE ARTICLES OF THE MARRIAGE TREATY HE ENCOURAGED THE ENGLISH SHIPS OF WAR AND PRIVATEERS TO SEIZE VESSELS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS
THAT FORTS WERE ERECTED IN ORDER TO BRIDLE ROCHELLE THE MOST CONSIDERABLE BULWARK OF THE PROTESTANTS THAT THE REFORMED IN FRANCE CAST THEIR EYES ON CHARLES AS THE HEAD OF THEIR FAITH
AND CONSIDERED HIM AS A PRINCE ENGAGED BY INTEREST AS WELL AS INCLINATION TO SUPPORT THEM THAT SO LONG AS THEIR PARTY SUBSISTED CHARLES MIGHT RELY ON THEIR ATTACHMENT AS MUCH AS ON THAT OF HIS OWN SUBJECTS BUT IF THEIR LIBERTIES WERE ONCE RAVISHED FROM THEM
THE POWER OF FRANCE FREED FROM THIS IMPEDIMENT WOULD SOON BECOME FORMIDABLE TO ENGLAND AND TO ALL THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS THOUGH CHARLES PROBABLY BORE BUT SMALL FAVOR TO THE HUGONOTS WHO SO MUCH RESEMBLED THE PURITANS IN DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP
AND BOTH OF THEM INTRUSTED TO THE COMMAND OF THE DUKE WHO WAS ALTOGETHER UNACQUAINTED BOTH WITH LAND AND SEA SERVICE THE FLEET APPEARED BEFORE ROCHELLE BUT SO ILL CONCERTED WERE BUCKINGHAM'S MEASURES THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THAT CITY
THIS THEORY RECEIVED SOMETHING OF A CHECK WHEN OUR FLOCK COUNTED ONLY TWENTY NINE THE NEXT MORNING THERE WERE MORE FOX TRACKS AND A GREAT MANY MORE FEATHERS UNDER THE TREE THIS PUT A NEW AND ALTOGETHER UGLY ASPECT ON THE MATTER
FROM THERE WE MARCHED TO SUPERIOR STREET WHERE CHEERS GREETED US ON EVERY HAND THE PAPERS HAD HERALDED MY ADVENT AND AS IN THE OTHER TOWNS AND CITIES
THAT THEATRE PUT ME WAY AHEAD FINANCIALLY THURSDAY MORNING I CALLED ON THE MAYOR MARK HANNA AND SENATOR GARFIELD AND ADDED THE AUTOGRAPHS OF ALL THREE TO MY ALBUM
I NEVER SHALL FORGET THE KINDNESSES OF ITS LANDLADY THE VILLAGE DATES BACK TO PIONEER DAYS IT IS BUILT ON THE HUNTING GROUNDS OF THE OLD CUYAHOGA INDIANS MONDAY MARCH FIRST AT TWELVE THIRTY P M
I SAW A MEADOW LARK ON THE FIRST OF MARCH THIS DAY I HEARD BLUE BIRDS AND ROBINS SINGING GAILY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH SPRING HAD COME TO STAY I EXPECTED THAT DAY TO REACH DALTON ONLY EIGHT MILES DISTANT
THE VILLAGE TREASURER WORE A BOILED SHIRT AND BRASS COLLAR BUTTONS BUT NO COLLAR OR COAT HIS COMPANIONS WERE GENERALLY ATTIRED IN FLANNEL SHIRTS OF DIFFERENT HUES AND PATTERNS
JUST WHEN EVERYTHING WAS ON THE TABLE AND THE GUESTS WERE FINDING STONES AND TIN PLATES TO SIT ON DON NOT HAVING HAD A THING TO EAT FOR AN HOUR COOLLY PULLED THE HOT STEAK OFF THE PLATTER AND DROPPED IT ON THE GROUND
A BOARD SIGN INFORMED US IT WAS SIMPLY TURKEY CREEK I COULDN'T SEE ANY TURKEYS BUT THERE WAS GOOD PASTURAGE AROUND THE HOT TRIP THROUGH THE TIMBER MADE US ALL HUNGRY
POD WENT FISHING THAT AFTERNOON WITH A GUN AND TOOK THE WHOLE ARSENAL ALONG WITH HIM INCLUDING THE AXE SOMEWHERE ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK POD CAME INTO CAMP WITH A GOOD MESS OF TROUT AFTER CLEANING THE FISH HE TOOK OFF HIS GUNS
THE SHOUTING SOUNDED NEARER EVERY SECOND AND I SOON DISTINGUISHED COONSKIN'S VOICE POD GOT UP FROM THE GROUND EXCITEDLY COONSKIN'S IN TROUBLE PLAIN ENOUGH SAID POD ALOUD TO HIMSELF I MUST RUN TO HIS AID
MEMORY OF HIS IDENTITY OF WHERE HE WAS OF WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF HIS STRENGTH WERE SHAKEN
A MIST LAY OVER HIS MIND AND MEMORY HE FELT DAZED AND HIS FORCES SCATTERED THE DEEPS WITHIN WERE TOO TROUBLED FOR HEALING POWER TO COME OUT OF THEM IT WAS GLAMOUR OF COURSE HE REALISED AFTERWARDS
SOMETHING FROM THE REGION OF UTTER COLD WAS UPON HIM AND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY THROUGH THE CONFUSED MISTS ABOUT HIM THERE SLOWLY ROSE UP THE PERSONALITY THAT HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME DIRECTING THE BATTLE SOME FORCE ENTERED HIS BEING
THAT SHOOK HIM AS THE TEMPEST SHAKES A LEAF AND CLOSE AGAINST HIS EYES CLEAN LEVEL WITH HIS FACE HE FOUND HIMSELF STARING INTO THE WRECK OF A VAST DARK COUNTENANCE A COUNTENANCE THAT WAS TERRIBLE EVEN IN ITS RUIN
THE INNER FORCES STIRRED AND TREMBLED IN RESPONSE TO HIS CALL THEY DID NOT AT FIRST COME READILY AS WAS THEIR HABIT FOR UNDER THE SPELL OF GLAMOUR THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN DIABOLICALLY LULLED INTO INACTIVITY BUT COME THEY EVENTUALLY DID
BY CEASING TO RESIST AND ALLOWING THE DEADLY STREAM TO POUR INTO HIM UNOPPOSED HE USED THE VERY POWER SUPPLIED BY HIS ADVERSARY AND THUS ENORMOUSLY INCREASED HIS OWN FOR THIS SPIRITUAL ALCHEMY HE HAD LEARNED HE UNDERSTOOD THAT FORCE
AND THE WHIRL OF RUSHING SHADOW CATS DISAPPEARED WHENCE THEY CAME AND WITH THE RETURN OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS OWN IDENTITY JOHN SILENCE WAS RESTORED TO THE FULL CONTROL OF HIS OWN WILL POWER IN A DEEP MODULATED VOICE
CLEARLY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE MISCHIEF TO WHICH HE HAD UNWITTINGLY LENT HIMSELF OWING TO HIS SUBTLE AND ELECTRIC CONSTITUTION STILL UTTERING HIS SHARP HIGH PURRINGS HE MARCHED UP TO HIS MASTER AND RUBBED VIGOROUSLY AGAINST HIS LEGS
AND PAWED HIS KNEES AND STARED BESEECHINGLY UP INTO HIS FACE HE TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE CORNER WHERE THE COLLIE STILL LAY THUMPING HIS TAIL FEEBLY AND PATHETICALLY JOHN SILENCE UNDERSTOOD HE BENT DOWN AND STROKED THE CREATURE'S LIVING FUR
BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY VERY WEAK AND OVERCOME SMOKE CONTINUED TO RUB AGAINST ITS CHEEK AND NOSE AND EYES SOMETIMES EVEN STANDING ON ITS BODY AND KNEADING INTO THE THICK YELLOW HAIR FLAME REPLIED FROM TIME TO TIME BY LITTLE LICKS OF THE TONGUE
MOST OF THEM CURIOUSLY MISDIRECTED BUT DOCTOR SILENCE FELT INTUITIVELY THAT SOMETHING DISASTROUS HAD HAPPENED AND HIS HEART WAS WRUNG HE STROKED THE DEAR BODY FEELING IT OVER FOR BRUISES OR BROKEN BONES BUT FINDING NONE
AND WOULD NOT GIVE FORTH A CHEERFUL FLAME
SAT ON HIS STONE TO LISTEN NEVER YET HAD SUCH SWEET STRAINS BEEN HEARD IN THE WORLD OF GLOOM THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME TEARS MOISTENED THE CHEEKS OF THE FURIES AND EVEN THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE DEAD WERE MOVED TO PITY
AND THE WELCOMING LIGHT OF THE UPPER AIR BEGAN TO PENETRATE THE DARKNESS THEN A SUDDEN FEAR STRUCK HIS HEART
HE SAT ON THE FURTHER BANK WITHOUT FOOD OR DRINK
THE TREES SHED THEIR LEAVES WITH GRIEF AND THE DRYADS AND NAIADS TORE THEIR HAIR AND PUT ON THE GARB OF SORROW ONLY THE PITILESS REVELERS KNEW NO REMORSE THEY SEIZED THE SINGER'S HEAD
I HAVE NO CAUSE TO FEAR BUT THOUGH LOKI REPEATED THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO HIMSELF HE WAS AFRAID HE WANDERED FAR INTO THE THICK WOODS AND COVERED HIMSELF WITH THE DEEP WATERS
BY MAKING A FISHING NET HE SPIED IN THE DISTANCE THE WHOLE COMPANY OF THE GODS APPROACHING HIS HOUSE THE SIGHT OF THEM COMING ALL TOGETHER BEAUTIFUL AND NOBLE AND FREE PIERCED LOKI WITH A PANG THAT WAS WORSE THAN DEATH
A ROPE WAS MADE OF THE DEAD WOLVES SINEWS AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHED LOKI'S BODY IT TURNED INTO BANDS OF IRON
JEFF THE INQUISITIVE BY GENERAL RUSH C HAWKINS AMONG THE GUNBOATS DOING DUTY ON THE INLAND WATERS OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE EARLY SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
WHICH COMPOSED WHAT COMMODORE GOLDSBOROUGH DESIGNATED HIS PASTEBOARD FLEET WAS THE LOUISIANA COMMANDED BY COMMANDER ALEXANDER MURRAY WHO WAS NOTED FOR HIS EFFICIENCY AND GOOD NATURE HIS TREATMENT OF HIS CREW
HE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN IN THE LAP OF ONE OF THE SAILORS HAVING HIS BACK STROKED HIS PLEASURE UPON THOSE OCCASIONS WAS EVINCED BY THE EMISSION OF FREQUENT GOOD NATURED GRUNTS AND LOOKING UP INTO THE FACE OF THE FRIENDLY STROKER
MORE THAN TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND THEN PATRIOTICALLY DECORATED IN HIS RIGHT EAR WAS A RED RIBBON IN HIS LEFT A WHITE ONE AROUND HIS NECK ANOTHER OF BLUE
HOGS OF THIS PARTICULAR KIND ARE FAMOUS SNAKE KILLERS A BIG RATTLER OR A GARTER SNAKE IS ALL THE SAME TO THEM THEY ADVANCE TO THE ATTACK WITH THE GREATEST IMPETUOSITY AND A FEAST UPON SNAKE IS THE USUAL REWARD OF EXCEPTIONAL BRAVERY
THE BUTTERFLY'S CHILDREN BY MISSUS ALFRED GATTY LET ME HIRE YOU AS A NURSE FOR MY POOR CHILDREN SAID A BUTTERFLY TO A QUIET CATERPILLAR WHO WAS STROLLING ALONG A CABBAGE LEAF IN HER
YOU MUST GIVE THEM EARLY DEW AND HONEY FROM THE FLOWERS AND YOU MUST LET THEM FLY ABOUT ONLY A LITTLE WAY AT FIRST FOR OF COURSE ONE CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO USE THEIR WINGS PROPERLY ALL AT ONCE
WAS LEFT STANDING ALONE BY THE SIDE OF THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS A PRETTY NURSE SHE HAS CHOSEN INDEED POOR LADY EXCLAIMED SHE AND A PRETTY BUSINESS I HAVE IN HAND WHY HER SENSES MUST HAVE LEFT HER
BUT I DON'T WANT TO CHATTER ANY MORE WITH YOU JUST NOW I HAVE HAD TO TROT A MILE ON ACCOUNT OF A CONFOUNDED HUNTER WHO STRUCK ME ON ONE OF MY HIND LEGS WITH AN ARROW NOW I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SLEEP
BUT IN THIS THE OLD OAK WAS WRONG FOR THEY DID COME TOWARDS AUTUMN THE BEAR CAME BACK AND LAY DOWN UNDER THE OLD OAK MY FRIENDS DOWN THERE WISH ME TO PRESENT THEIR COMPLIMENTS HE SAID
A GREAT OAK CALLED OUT AND SHOOK HIS BOUGHS IN TERROR BUT THE OLD OAK TOOK HIS FOSTER CHILDREN UNDER HIS PROTECTION IT SERVES HIM RIGHT HE SAID HE IS PAID OUT FOR HIS BOASTING
BE GOOD ENOUGH TO MOVE YOUR LEAVES A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE THERE HAVE BEEN SCARCELY ANY BUDS ON MY LOWEST BRANCHES THIS YEAR YOU OVERSHADOW ME SO I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CONCERNS US ANSWERED THE BEECHES
AND AM GLAD TO DO YOU A GOOD TURN AND THE FOX ROLLED ON THE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF THE BEECH TREES AND GOT HIS FUR FULL OF THE PRICKLY FRUITS AND RAN WITH THEM FAR OUT INTO THE COUNTRY THE BEAR DID THE SAME
BY THIS TIME THERE WERE MANY MORE HUMAN BEINGS IN THE LAND THAN THERE WERE BEFORE AND THEY MADE HASTE TO HEW DOWN THE OAKS WHILE THERE WERE STILL SOME REMAINING OAK TIMBER IS BETTER THAN BEECH TIMBER THEY SAID
BESIDES NUMBERLESS VEXATIONS AND PERSECUTIONS WHICH THE CLERGY UNDERWENT FROM THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE LOWER HOUSE THE PEERS WHILE THE KING WAS IN SCOTLAND
AND ENDOWED WITH THAT DIGNIFIED PRIDE WHICH SO WELL BECAME HIS RANK AND STATION THE EARL OF ESSEX WHO INHERITED ALL HIS FATHER'S POPULARITY AND HAVING FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH SOUGHT RENOWN IN ARMS
HOWEVER RIDICULOUS WERE WILLINGLY ATTENDED TO AND WERE DISPERSED AMONG THE MULTITUDE TO WHOSE CAPACITY THEY WERE WELL ADAPTED BEALE A TAILOR INFORMED THE COMMONS THAT WALKING IN THE FIELDS
HE HAD HEARKENED TO THE DISCOURSE OF CERTAIN PERSONS UNKNOWN TO HIM AND HAD HEARD THEM TALK OF A MOST DANGEROUS CONSPIRACY A HUNDRED AND EIGHT RUFFIANS AS HE LEARNED HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO MURDER A HUNDRED AND EIGHT LORDS AND COMMONERS
AND WERE PROMISED REWARDS FOR THESE ASSASSINATIONS
MESSENGERS WERE EMPLOYED TO SEARCH FOR THEM AND ARREST THEM THEIR TRUNKS CHAMBERS AND STUDIES WERE SEALED AND LOCKED THE HOUSE VOTED ALL THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO BE BREACHES OF PRIVILEGE
THE PERSONS WHOM HE HAD ACCUSED THIS RESOLUTION WAS DISCOVERED TO THE COUNTESS OF CARLISLE SISTER TO NORTHUMBERLAND A LADY OF SPIRIT WIT AND INTRIGUE SHE PRIVATELY SENT INTELLIGENCE TO THE FIVE MEMBERS
YESTERDAY I SENT A SERJEANT AT ARMS TO DEMAND SOME WHO BY MY ORDER WERE ACCUSED OF HIGH TREASON INSTEAD OF OBEDIENCE I RECEIVED A MESSAGE I MUST HERE DECLARE TO YOU
THAT THOUGH NO KING THAT EVER WAS IN ENGLAND COULD BE MORE CAREFUL OF YOUR PRIVILEGES THAN I SHALL BE YET IN CASES OF TREASON NO PERSON HAS PRIVILEGE
WHO WERE APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE OR PERHAPS ACTUATED BY THEIR OWN TERRORS RAN FROM GATE TO GATE CRYING OUT THAT THE CAVALIERS WERE COMING TO BURN THE CITY AND THAT THE KING HIMSELF WAS AT THEIR HEAD
NEXT MORNING CHARLES SENT TO THE MAYOR AND ORDERED HIM TO CALL A COMMON COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK HE HIMSELF ATTENDED ONLY BY THREE OR FOUR LORDS WENT TO GUILDHALL
ALL THIS CONSIDERED THERE IS A JUDGMENT OF HEAVEN UPON THIS NATION IF THESE DISTRACTIONS CONTINUE GOD SO DEAL WITH ME AND MINE AS ALL MY THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS ARE UPRIGHT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE TRUE PROTESTANT PROFESSION
IT WILL HAZARD THE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY OF ALL HIS KINGDOMS UNLESS SOME SPEEDY REMEDY BE APPLIED BY THE WISDOM AND AUTHORITY OF BOTH HOUSES AND THAT SUCH OF THE SUBJECTS AS HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE AGAINST THE COMMON DANGER
HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF MANY AND TO RECOVER THEM FROM THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH AT FIRST THEY HAD BEEN SEIZED
GARRISONS AND FORTS OF THE KINGDOM HE ISSUED PROCLAMATIONS AGAINST THIS MANIFEST USURPATION
NEVER WERE THERE INDIVIDUALS WHO POSSESSED MORE CAPACITY MORE COURAGE MORE PUBLIC SPIRIT MORE DISINTERESTED ZEAL THE INFUSION OF ONE INGREDIENT IN TOO LARGE A PROPORTION HAD CORRUPTED ALL THESE NOBLE PRINCIPLES
THOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY LEVIED A GUARD FOR THEMSELVES HAD ATTEMPTED TO SEIZE ALL THE MILITARY POWER ALL THE NAVY AND ALL THE FORTS OF THE KINGDOM AND HAD OPENLY EMPLOYED THEIR AUTHORITY IN EVERY KIND OF WARLIKE PREPARATIONS YET IMMEDIATELY VOTED
AND THE COMMAND OF THEM WAS GIVEN TO THE EARL OF ESSEX IN LONDON NO LESS THAN FOUR THOUSAND MEN ENLISTED IN ONE DAY AND THE PARLIAMENT VOTED A DECLARATION WHICH THEY REQUIRED EVERY MEMBER TO SUBSCRIBE
IN ORDER TO REMOVE ALL JEALOUSY HE HAD RESOLVED THAT THEIR USURPATIONS AND ILLEGAL PRETENSIONS SHOULD BE APPARENT TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND THOUGHT THAT TO RECOVER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS A POINT MUCH MORE MATERIAL TO HIS INTEREST
THAN THE COLLECTING OF ANY MAGAZINES STORES OR ARMIES WHICH MIGHT BREED APPREHENSIONS OF VIOLENT OR ILLEGAL COUNSELS BUT THE URGENT NECESSITY OF HIS SITUATION NO LONGER ADMITTED OF DELAY
MANNERS PERSONS PURSES AND PROPENSITIES OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WHICH SURROUNDED HIM AN INFLUENCE THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND DESPOTIC YET AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST INDEFINITE AND ALTOGETHER UNACCOUNTABLE
WHICH UPON EACH SUCH FAILURE OF HIS PRAISE WORTHY ENDEAVORS WOULD SUFFUSE EVERY LINEAMENT OF HIS COUNTENANCE LEFT NOT THE SLIGHTEST ROOM FOR DOUBT OF HIS SINCERITY IN THE BOSOMS OF EVEN HIS MOST SKEPTICAL COMPANIONS
BUT IT WAS UPON HIS MINUTE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ETIQUETTE OF THE DUELLO AND THE NICETY OF HIS SENSE OF HONOR THAT HE MOST ESPECIALLY PRIDED HIMSELF THESE THINGS WERE A HOBBY WHICH HE RODE TO THE DEATH TO RITZNER
I WOULD SAY SIR THAT YOUR OPINIONS ARE NOT THE OPINIONS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A GENTLEMAN AS HERMANN COMPLETED THIS EQUIVOCAL SENTENCE ALL EYES WERE TURNED UPON THE BARON
THE LANGUAGE YOU HAVE THOUGHT PROPER TO EMPLOY
THIS BEING DONE THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY WHATEVER I SHALL DISCHARGE THIS DECANTER OF WINE AT YOUR IMAGE IN YONDER MIRROR AND THUS FULFIL ALL THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE EXACT LETTER OF RESENTMENT FOR YOUR INSULT
BRANTOME'S MEMOIRS OF DUELS PUBLISHED AT COLOGNE SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX
HE HANDED ME THE VOLUME AND ASKED ME TO LOOK OVER SOME PORTION OF IT I DID SO BUT TO LITTLE PURPOSE NOT BEING ABLE TO GATHER THE LEAST PARTICLE OF MEANING HE THEN TOOK THE BOOK HIMSELF AND READ ME A CHAPTER ALOUD TO MY SURPRISE
HE NOW EXPLAINED THE MYSTERY
HIS SPINE GAVE NOTICE OF WHAT ETIQUETTE DEMANDED IN THE EVENT OF OUTDOOR APPARITION IF A MAN FAILED TO BARE HIS HEAD IN AWE THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR REMINDED HIM OF HIS REMISSNESS
AND HAVE CHIVALROUSLY SPARED THE GENTLER SHADES AND THERE ARE VERY FEW FUNNY CHILD GHOSTS YOU MIGHT ALMOST SAY NONE IN COMPARISON WITH THE NUMBER OF GROWN UPS
AND INDULGING IN GREATER FREEDOM A GHOST CAN CALL HIS SHADE HIS OWN NOW AND EXHIBIT ANY MOOD HE PLEASES EVEN YOUNG FEMALE WRAITHS DEMANDING LATCHKEYS REFUSE TO OBEY THE FROWNING FACE OF THE CLOCK
HE KNOWS THAT THERE'S NO WEAPON NO THREAT IN HORROR TO BE COMPARED WITH RIDICULE THINK WHAT A SOLEMN CREATURE THE GOTHIC GHOST WAS
HIS JEST IS LIKELY TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE POINT TO IT AND HE CAN HAUNT SO INSIDIOUSLY CAN MAKE HIMSELF SO AT HOME IN HIS HOST'S STUDY OR BEDROOM THAT A MAN ACTUALLY WELCOMES A CHAT WITH HIM
GHOSTS NOT ONLY HAVE APPALLINGLY LONG MEMORIES BUT THEY POSSESS A MEAN ADVANTAGE OVER THE LIVING IN THAT THEY HAVE ONCE BEEN MORTAL
THE MODERN HUMOROUS GHOST SATIRIZES EVERYTHING FROM THE OLD FASHIONED SPECTER HE'S VERY FOND OF TAKING POT SHOTS AT HIM TO THE LATEST PSYCHIC MANIFESTATIONS
HE LAUGHS AT GHOSTS THAT AREN'T EXPERTS IN EFFICIENCY HAUNTING AND HE HAS A LOT OF FUN OUT OF MORTALS FOR BEING SCARED OF SPECTERS HE LOVES TO SHAKE THE LUGUBRIOUS TERRORS OF THE PAST BEFORE YOU
KICKING HIS HEELS AGAINST THE RAILING AND HEARS HIS ADMONITION THAT HE'D BETTER HURRY UP AS THE LIVE UNCLE IS COMING IN SIGHT
HAS NEVER BEEN A GHOST NOR USED A WOODEN LEG BUT A TERRIFYING LEG ACY WHILE YOU DO BELIEVE IN IT THE NEW GHOST HAS A MORE NIMBLE AND VERSATILE TONGUE AS WELL AS WIT
IN THE OLDER FICTION AND DRAMA APPARITIONS SPOKE SELDOM
AND GHOSTS LIKE KINGS IN DRAMA WERE OF A DIGNITY AND MUST PRESERVE IT IN THEIR SPEECH OR PERHAPS THE AUTHORS WERE DOUBTFUL AS TO THE DIALOGUE OF SHADES
BUT THE SPOOK THAT PROVIDES A JOKE ON HIS HOST OR ON HIMSELF IS YANKEE IN ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT THE DRY HUMOR THE COMIC SENSE OF THE INCONGRUOUS THE WILLINGNESS TO LAUGH AT HIMSELF AS AT OTHERS
TILL THE PHANTOM COUPLE TAKE A LIKING TO EACH OTHER AND DECIDE TO LET THE LIVING BURY THEIR DEAD THIS IS SUGGESTIVE OF BRANDER MATTHEWS'S EARLIER AND CLEVERER STORY OF A SPECTRAL COURTSHIP IN THE RIVAL GHOSTS
JOHN KENDRICK BANGS HAS MADE THE DARKER REGIONS SEEM COMFORTABLE AND HOMELIKE FOR US AND HAS CREATED GHOSTS SO HUMAN AND SO FUNNY THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ONE OR MORE
HE SAID ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE STARTING WE AREN'T STARTING SAID THE VOICE WHAT'S THE MATTER WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE BUSHES FOR WHATEVER'S THE MATTER UDO
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT HE WAS SAVE THAT THERE WAS AN IMPRESSION OF MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIS PERSON SUCH MAGNIFICENCE ANYHOW AS IS GIVEN BY AN ASTRAKHAN TRIMMED FUR COAT
SAID UDO NERVOUSLY THEN FRANKLY YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS LOOKS FUNNY VERY FUNNY SAID UDO WISTFULLY VERY FUNNY SAID CORONEL HIS HIGHNESS SIGHED
HE ADDED BITTERLY HOW DID IT HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW CORONEL I JUST WENT TO SLEEP
THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME HE BEGAN TO LOOK SO MUCH HAPPIER THAT CORONEL THOUGHT IT WAS A FAVOURABLE MOMENT IN WHICH TO WITHDRAW SHALL I GO NOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY
THE CONTRAST WAS TOO STRIKING BUT HE ALONE HYACINTH'S ONLY HELP SURELY SHE WOULD APPRECIATE HIS MAGNANIMITY ALSO AS HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF A MOMENT AGO
ARE SAID TO BE UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED FATHOMS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA ON THE SIDES OF WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT VARIETY OF TALL NOBLE TREES LOADED WITH MARINE FRUIT SUCH AS LOBSTERS CRABS OYSTERS SCOLLOPS
FRUIT SHOOK OFF THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE IT GROWS UPON BY THE MOTION OF THE WATER AS THOSE IN OUR GARDENS ARE BY THAT OF THE WIND THE LOBSTER TREES APPEARED THE RICHEST BUT THE CRAB AND OYSTERS WERE THE TALLEST
AND MANY OF THEM BEING SEPARATED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE SHOCK THEY FELL UPON A CRAB TREE WHICH WAS GROWING BELOW THEM THEY HAVE LIKE THE FARINA OF PLANTS UNITED AND PRODUCED A FISH RESEMBLING BOTH
AS WE DREW NEAR THE DUTCH SHORE AND THE BODY OF WATER OVER OUR HEADS DID NOT EXCEED TWENTY FATHOMS I THOUGHT I SAW A HUMAN FIGURE IN A FEMALE DRESS THEN LYING ON THE SAND BEFORE ME WITH SOME SIGNS OF LIFE
OF LONDON TREATED HER PROPERLY AND SHE RECOVERED SHE WAS THE RIB OF A MAN WHO COMMANDED A VESSEL BELONGING TO HELVOETSLUYS HE WAS JUST GOING OUT OF PORT ON A VOYAGE WHEN SHE HEARING HE HAD GOT A MISTRESS WITH HIM
THIS WAS WHAT MARIUS PERCEIVED MOST CLEARLY OF ALL A SORT OF HORRIBLE FASCINATION HELD HIM NAILED TO HIS POST FROM WHICH HE WAS OBSERVING AND COMMANDING THIS WHOLE SCENE THERE HE STOOD
THINK THAT THE LARK REALLY IS YOUR DAUGHTER
THEY WILL BOTH ENTER THE CARRIAGE WITH MY COMRADE BEHIND SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THE BARRIER THERE IS A TRAP HARNESSED TO TWO VERY GOOD HORSES YOUR YOUNG LADY WILL BE TAKEN TO IT SHE WILL ALIGHT FROM THE FIACRE
IT WAS BY THE PERIL OF THE ONE HE LOVED THAT HE FELT HIMSELF RESTRAINED THIS FRIGHTFUL SITUATION WHICH HAD ALREADY LASTED ABOVE HALF AN HOUR WAS CHANGING ITS ASPECT EVERY MOMENT
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT SWUNG HIS RIGHT FOOT WHICH HUNG DOWN AND STARED AT THE BRAZIER WITH AN AIR OF SAVAGE REVERY
STARED AT HIM IN STUPEFACTION AS ALMOST FREE AND IN A FORMIDABLE ATTITUDE HE BRANDISHED ABOVE HIS HEAD THE RED HOT CHISEL WHICH EMITTED A THREATENING GLOW
THEY ALSO FOUND A TINY SAW OF BLUE STEEL WHICH WOULD FIT THE SOU IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRISONER HAD THIS SOU PIECE ON HIS PERSON AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE RUFFIANS SEARCHED HIM THAT HE CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IT IN HIS HAND
AS HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEND DOWN FOR FEAR OF BETRAYING HIMSELF HE HAD NOT CUT THE BONDS OF HIS LEFT LEG THE RUFFIANS HAD RECOVERED FROM THEIR FIRST SURPRISE BE EASY
THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME WRITE WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO WRITE THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME SAY WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO SAY HE STRIPPED UP HIS LEFT SLEEVE AND ADDED SEE HERE
AT THE SAME MOMENT HE EXTENDED HIS ARM AND LAID THE GLOWING CHISEL WHICH HE HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND BY ITS WOODEN HANDLE
THE HORRIBLE GLOWING TOOL DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT WHIRLING AS IT FLEW AND FELL FAR AWAY ON THE SNOW THE PRISONER RESUMED DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH ME HE WAS DISARMED
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO CUT HIS THROAT THAT'S IT IT WAS THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TAKING COUNSEL TOGETHER THENARDIER WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE TABLE
SHE HANDED IT TO HER HUSBAND WHERE DID THIS COME FROM DEMANDED THENARDIER PARDIE EJACULATED HIS WIFE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE IT CAME FROM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING YOU UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS FOR INSTANCE HATS BABY LINEN GLOVES SILKS LACE OR CURTAINS
WE COULD SHOW YOU SOMETHING BETTER OF COURSE NO TROUBLE MADAM I ASSURE YOU SUCH WERE THE SIMPLE COUNTERS OF HIS INTERCOURSE SO I SAY
SAYN THEN A PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE COME INTO VIEW
HAVE SCRIBBLED A STILL MORE FLOURISHING J M ALL OVER THE DOCUMENT HAVE ASKED YOU IF THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HAVE STOOD BY YOU SUPPOSING THAT YOU WERE PAYING CASH UNTIL THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY REAPPEARED WITH THE CHANGE
CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OTHER ABRASIONS AND CONTUSIONS POINTED UNMISTAKABLY TO THE VIOLENT IMPACT OF THE MOUNTING BEGINNER UPON THE BICYCLING SADDLE AND THAT THE RUINOUS STATE OF THE RIGHT KNEE WAS EQUALLY ELOQUENT
THE SHOP WALKER BRINGS UP PARALLEL TO THE COUNTER ANY PARTICULAR TIME WHEN YOU WANT YOUR HOLIDAYS HE ASKS HOOPDRIVER PULLS AT HIS SKIMPY MOUSTACHE NO DON'T WANT THEM TOO LATE SIR OF COURSE
AND ALWAYS LIGHT UP BEFORE DARK YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT HOOPDRIVER AND NOTHING MUCH CAN'T HAPPEN TO YOU YOU TAKE MY WORD RIGHT YOU ARE SAID HOOPDRIVER GOOD NIGHT OLD MAN GOOD NIGHT SAID BRIGGS
AFTER A PAUSE BECHAMEL WENT BACK TO THE DINING ROOM THEY HEARD A CHAIR CREAK UNDER HIM INTERLUDE OF CONVERSATIONAL EYEBROWS I'M GOING UP SAID STEPHEN TO BREAK THE MELANCHOLY NEWS TO HIM BECHAMEL LOOKED UP FROM A WEEK OLD NEWSPAPER
AS WITHOUT KNOCKING STEPHEN ENTERED BECHAMEL'S FACE SUGGESTED A DIFFERENT EXPECTATION BEG PARDON SIR SAID STEPHEN WITH A DIPLOMATIC COUGH WELL SAID BECHAMEL WONDERING SUDDENLY IF JESSIE HAD KEPT SOME OF HER THREATS
SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE OFF WITH HIM AND THAT LITTLE BUSINESS WAS OVER AND HE WAS HERE STRANDED AND SOLD
AND HIS ONLY RAY OF HOPE WAS THAT IT SEEMED MORE PROBABLE AFTER ALL THAT THE GIRL HAD ESCAPED THROUGH HER STEPMOTHER IN WHICH CASE THE BUSINESS MIGHT BE HUSHED UP YET AND THE EVIL HOUR OF EXPLANATION WITH HIS WIFE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED
THEY SCARCELY HEEDED WHITHER THEY RODE AT FIRST BEING ONLY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY TURNING ONCE WESTWARD WHEN THE SPIRE OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL ROSE SUDDENLY NEAR THEM OUT OF THE DEWY NIGHT PALE AND INTRICATE AND HIGH
ALMOST KNEELING IN FRONT OF HER WITH AN UNREASONABLE APPROBATION IN HER EYES IT WAS AS I HAVE INDICATED THE HOUR AND SEASON OF THE FULL MOON
QUITE A MISUNDERSTANDING SAID HOOPDRIVER WITH SPLENDID READINESS MY SISTER HAD GONE TO BOGNOR BUT I BROUGHT HER BACK HERE I'VE TOOK A FANCY TO THIS PLACE AND THE MOONLIGHT'S SIMPLY DEE VINE WE'VE HAD SUPPER THENKS AND WE'RE TIRED SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER
WHEN THE QUEEN HEARD THIS NEWS SHE SENT FOR MILLINERS DRESSMAKERS JEWELLERS AND DECKED TROUTINA FROM HEAD TO FOOT BUT TO FLORINA SHE ALLOWED NOT A SINGLE NEW FROCK THE POOR PRINCESS HAD TO PUT ON HER OLD ONE
BUT CONVERSED WITH FLORINA FOR THREE HOURS WITHOUT STOPPING INDEED HIS ADMIRATION OF HER WAS SO PLAIN THAT THE QUEEN AND TROUTINA BEGGED OF THE KING THAT SHE MIGHT BE SHUT UP IN A TOWER DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF HIS VISIT
BUT PIERCED BY ONE ONLY THE MOTTO BEING SHE ALONE THE HEART WAS MADE OF A SINGLE RUBY AS BIG AS AN OSTRICH'S EGG
WHEN HE WAS ALONE HE SENT FOR ONE OF HIS ATTENDANTS WHOM HE TRUSTED VERY MUCH AND BEGGED HIM TO GAIN INFORMATION FROM SOME COURT LADY ABOUT THE PRINCESS FLORINA THIS SCHEME SUCCEEDED SO WELL
BUT AS HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO WISH TO SAIL ABOUT FOR EVER HE AT LAST PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD DESCEND TO EARTH AND BE MARRIED TROUTINA AGREED WITH ALL HER HEART BUT WISHED THAT THE CEREMONY SHOULD BE PERFORMED AT HER GODMOTHER'S
IF YOU WILL ONLY GIVE ME BACK MY PRINCESS AM NOT I SHE SAID TROUTINA IT WAS TO ME YOU GAVE THIS RING TO ME YOU SPOKE AT THE WINDOW I HAVE BEEN WICKEDLY DECEIVED CRIED THE KING
HIS BODY WASTED INTO THE SLENDER SHAPE OF A BIRD AND WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT BLUE FEATHERS HIS EYES BECAME ROUND AND BEADY HIS NOSE AN IVORY BEAK AND HIS CROWN WAS A WHITE PLUME ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD
HE BEGAN TO SPEAK IN A SINGING VOICE AND THEN UTTERING A DOLEFUL CRY FLED AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THE FATAL PALACE OF SOUSSIO BUT THOUGH HE LOOKED ONLY A BLUE BIRD
WHO LIKED TO SEE HER LOVELY AND SHE HAD ADORNED HERSELF WITH ALL THE PRETTY THINGS HE HAD GIVEN HER HE PERCHED ON THE WINDOW SILL AND SHE SAT AT THE WINDOW AND THEY WERE SINGING TOGETHER A DUET WHICH THE QUEEN HEARD OUTSIDE
AND VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED THE QUEEN LEFT HER AND WENT TO HOLD COUNSEL WITH TROUTINA AS TO WHAT WAS TO BE DONE THEY AGREED TO PUT IN FLORINA'S CHAMBER A WAITING MAID WHO SHOULD WATCH HER FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT
WHO WARBLED IN HER EAR AND TOUCHED HER GENTLY WITH HIS BEAK THE SPY LISTENED AND HEARD ALL THEIR CONVERSATION VERY MUCH ASTONISHED THAT A PRINCESS COULD BE SO FOND OF A MERE BIRD WHEN DAY CAME
RESTORED FLORINA'S HEALTH AND GAVE HER STRENGTH TO CALL A COUNCIL AND ARRANGE ALL THE AFFAIRS OF HER KINGDOM THEN SHE DEPARTED BY NIGHT AND ALONE TO GO OVER THE WORLD IN SEARCH OF HER BLUE BIRD THE MAGICIAN
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE MAGICIAN THOUGHT IT BEST TO AGREE WITH SOUSSIO THAT KING CHARMING SHOULD BE RESTORED TO HIS KINGDOM AND HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SIX MONTHS ON CONDITION THAT TROUTINA SHOULD REMAIN IN HIS PALACE
BUT HE THOUGHT LESS OF THESE THINGS THAN HOW TO ESCAPE FROM THE HORROR OF MARRYING TROUTINA MEANWHILE THE QUEEN FLORINA IN A PEASANT'S DRESS WITH A STRAW HAT ON HER HEAD AND A CANVAS SACK ON HER SHOULDER
GREATLY COMFORTED PUT THE EGGS IN HER SACK
UNDISTURBED BY HER LAMENTATION SLEPT WITHOUT WAKING TILL DAWN THE THIRD DAY ONE OF THE PALACE VALETS PASSING HER BY SAID YOU STUPID PEASANT GIRL IT IS WELL THE KING TAKES OPIUM EVERY NIGHT
BAKED AND MADE READY FOR THE TABLE SANG AS BEAUTIFULLY AS BIRDS THAT ARE ALIVE TROUTINA CHARMED WITH THIS MARVELLOUS NOVELTY BOUGHT IT AT THE SAME PRICE AS THE REST ADDING GENEROUSLY A SMALL PIECE OF GOLD
AND THEY EMBRACED AND WEPT TOGETHER FOR WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF ALL THEIR LOVE WHEN THEY WERE STILL IN THE POWER OF THE FAIRY SOUSSIO BUT AT THIS MOMENT APPEARED THE FRIENDLY ENCHANTER WITH A FAIRY STILL GREATER THAN SOUSSIO
THIS FAMILY LIKENESS MAY BE TRACED IN THE FAIRY TALES OF ALL COUNTRIES I MERELY REFER TO IT TO SHOW THAT THE REPETITION OF INCIDENTS WAS NOT UNOBSERVED OR UNINTENTIONAL
ARE LONG SLENDER SHARP NOSED SLIPPERY PEOPLE WITH A FRINGE OF FINS ALONG THEIR BACKS AND ANOTHER FRINGE ALONG THEIR BELLIES THEY BREATHE THROUGH VERY SMALL GILL OPENINGS IN THE BACKS OF THEIR HEADS
JIGGLING THE YOUNG CLAMS AND RACING WITH EACH OTHER WHERE THE BOTTOM WAS SMOOTH BEAT YOU RUNNING BACKWARD CRIED THE SAUCY CRAYFISH TO THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH AND THEY SCAMPERED ALONG BACKWARD IN THE MOONLIT WATER THERE WAS AN OLD LOG ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POND
THAN FOR MINKS TO HAVE WHITE UPPER LIPS AND THAT HAPPENS ONLY ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE THIS MINK WAS A BACHELOR AND NOBODY KNEW WHY SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS WAITING TO FIND A WIFE WITH A WHITE TIP ON HER TAIL
YET THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOR HE WAS TOO WISE TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT NEVER HAPPEN HOWEVER IT WAS HE LIVED ALONE AND FISHED AND HUNTED JUST FOR HIMSELF HE COULD DIVE MORE QUICKLY
STAY UNDER WATER LONGER AND HUNT BY SCENT BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MINK ROUND THERE HIS FUR WAS SLEEKER AND MORE SHINING THAN THAT OF HIS FRIENDS AND IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE SISTERS OF HIS FRIENDS THOUGHT THAT HE OUGHT TO MARRY
AND THE BROTHERS WERE BIGGER THAN THE SISTERS AS MINK BROTHERS ALWAYS ARE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL THE SAME AGE ONE WAS VERY MUCH LARGER THAN ANY OF THE REST AND SO THEY CALLED HIM BIG BROTHER
HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NEVER SUCH A FINE MINK AS THE BACHELOR AND HE USED TO FOLLOW HIM AROUND
AND HE PRETENDED NOT TO KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT BY IT A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS THE BACHELOR WAS CAUGHT IN A TRAP A COMMON CLUMSY WOODEN TRAP PUT TOGETHER WITH NAILS AND TWINE
I HAVE GOOD TEETH SAID HE TELL ME WHAT TO DO IF YOU WILL HELP ME OUT SAID THE BACHELOR I WILL GIVE YOU MY LUCK AND WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE TAIL I HAVE ASKED THE YOUNG MINK
COME FOR THE TRAP AND THE MINK IN IT BEFORE HE FINISHED NOW TRY IT SAID HE AFTER HE HAD GNAWED FOR QUITE A WHILE THE BACHELOR BACKED OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD BUT HIS BODY STUCK IN THE HOLE
AND HE RAISED ONE OF HIS HIND FEET TO SHOW WHERE HE MEANT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL HINDFOOT THICKLY PADDED AND WITH SHORT PARTLY WEBBED TOES AND NO HAIR AT ALL GROWING BETWEEN THEM THE CLAWS WERE SHORT SHARP AND CURVED
THEN YOU WILL HAVE GOOD LUCK WHEN THEIRS IS POOR YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY TO EAT WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY YOU CAN BEAT IN EVERY FIGHT YOU CAN HAVE SLEEK SHINING FUR
AND ARE AWAKE AT NIGHT WE WISH IT WOULD ALWAYS BE WARM WEATHER SAID THE YOUNG MUSKRATS WHAT'S THE USE OF WINTER HARD TO TELL ANSWERED ONE MUSKRAT
WHO HAD LIVED IN THE MARSH LONGER THAN THE REST HARD TO TELL I KNOW IT ALWAYS GIVES ME A GOOD APPETITE THOUGH THEN ALL THE MUSKRATS LAUGHED THEY WERE A JOLLY GOOD NATURED COMPANY AND EASY TO GET ALONG WITH
LIKE ALL YOUNG MUSKRATS THEY WERE FULL OF FUN AND THERE WERE FEW PLEASANTER SIGHTS THAN TO SEE THEM FROLICKING ON A WARM MOONLIGHT EVENING WHEN THEY LOOKED LIKE BROWN BALLS ROLLING AND BOUNDING AROUND ON THE SHORE OR PLUNGING INTO THE WATER
IF THEY HAD ALL BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN PLEASANTER FOR THE OLDEST FIVE WOULD PUT ON AIRS AND CALL THE OTHERS THE CHILDREN AND THE NEXT FIVE WOULD CALL THE YOUNGEST FIVE
THE OTHERS SAID YOU MIGHT GIVE UP TO US BECAUSE WE'RE THE YOUNGEST THEY PUSHED AND SCRAMBLED SOME MORE AND ONE OF THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN SAID TO ONE OF THE OLDEST WELL I DON'T CARE I'M JUST AS BIG AS YOU ARE
WHICH WAS SO AND THE OLDER ONE ANSWERED BACK WELL YOU'RE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE THEN PART OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
TOOK SIDES WITH ONE AND PART TOOK SIDES WITH THE OTHER WHAT HAD BEEN A LOVELY FROLIC BECAME AN UNPLEASANT DISGRACEFUL QUARREL AND THEY SAID SUCH THINGS AS THESE
FOR THEY KNEW THAT THE MUSKRAT WHO IS HURT IN WINTER NEVER GETS WELL AFTER SHE HAD LET THEM THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE SHE SAID I SHALL PUNISH YOU ALL FOR THIS
THEY THOUGHT IT SOUNDED VERY MUCH THE SAME AS BEING SENT TO BED FOR BEING NAUGHTY THEY DID NOT DARE SAY ANYTHING FOR THEY KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER WAS GENTLE AS MUSKRATS ARE MOST OF THE TIME SHE COULD BE VERY SEVERE
IN LATITUDE FORTY SEVEN DEGREES
SO THE FLOOR OF THIS SEA HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A BATTLEFIELD WHERE EVERY SHIP DEFEATED
AND IN ONLY A FEW YEARS HOW MANY VICTIMS HAVE BEEN FURNISHED TO THE OBITUARY NOTICES BY THE ROYAL MAIL INMAN AND MONTREAL LINES BY VESSELS NAMED THE SOLWAY THE ISIS THE PARAMATTA
OF THEIR GLOOMY RUBBLE THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED
AND RARE AMONG ITS BRETHREN IN THAT IT PRACTICES MONOGAMY A GOOD SIZED EELPOUT A TYPE OF EMERALD MORAY WHOSE FLAVOR IS EXCELLENT WOLFFISH WITH BIG EYES
CAN PROTECT ITS RESPIRATORY ORGANS FROM ANY PARCHING CONTACT WITH THE AIR AND CAN LIVE OUT OF WATER FOR A GOOD WHILE AND I'LL MENTION FOR THE RECORD SOME LITTLE BANDED BLENNIES
THAT FOLLOW SHIPS INTO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS SHARP SNOUTED CARP EXCLUSIVE TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC SCORPIONFISH AND LASTLY
OF A CORK FLOAT THE NAUTILUS HAD TO MANEUVER SHREWDLY IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNDERWATER SPIDERWEB BUT THE SHIP DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THESE HEAVILY TRAVELED WATERWAYS IT WENT UP TO ABOUT LATITUDE FORTY TWO DEGREES
THIS BROUGHT IT ABREAST OF SAINT JOHN'S IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND HEART'S CONTENT WHERE THE ATLANTIC CABLE REACHES ITS END POINT INSTEAD OF CONTINUING NORTH THE NAUTILUS TOOK AN EASTERLY HEADING
AFTER TRANSMITTING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TELEGRAMS IT WENT DEAD IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ENGINEERS BUILT A NEW CABLE THAT MEASURED
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND THIS ELECTRIC CABLE IN MINT CONDITION AS IT LOOKED ON LEAVING ITS PLACE OF MANUFACTURE THE LONG SNAKE WAS COVERED WITH SEASHELL RUBBLE AND BRISTLING WITH
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY KILOMETERS WIDE INTO WHICH YOU COULD FIT MT BLANC WITHOUT ITS SUMMIT POKING ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES THIS VALLEY IS CLOSED OFF TO THE EAST BY A SHEER WALL
I LOOKED TO PORT AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE IMMENSENESS OF THESE TRANQUIL WATERS TO STARBOARD A PROMINENT BULGE ON THE SEA BOTTOM CAUGHT MY ATTENTION YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
OF THE ISLAND OF GRENADA ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE UNDER THE COUNT DE GRASSE IT TOOK PART IN THE BATTLE OF CHESAPEAKE BAY IN SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR
THE NEW REPUBLIC OF FRANCE CHANGED THE NAME OF THIS SHIP ON APRIL SIXTEENTH OF THAT SAME YEAR IT JOINED THE SQUADRON AT BREST UNDER REAR ADMIRAL
AND LONGITUDE SEVENTEEN DEGREES
AS THEY CAME NEAR THE POND THEY FLEW LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL ALL SWEPT DOWN TO THE EARTH AND ALIGHTED TALL AND STATELY BY THE EDGE OF THE WATER THEY HAD EATEN NOTHING FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND WERE SOON HUNTING FOR FOOD SOME ON LAND
HE WOULD BEND HIS BODY STRETCH OUT HIS NECK OPEN HIS LONG SLENDER BILL AND SWALLOW IT AT ONE GULP THEN HE WOULD SEEM TO FALL ASLEEP AGAIN WHILE MOST OF THE CRANES WERE STILL FEEDING SOME OF THEM WERE STALKING THROUGH THE WOODS AND LOOKING THIS WAY AND THAT
THEY WERE THOSE WHO THOUGHT OF STAYING THERE FOR THE SUMMER WHEN THE FLOCK AROSE TO FLY ON AGAIN EIGHT CRANES STAYED BEHIND THEY WATCHED THEIR FRIENDS FLY AWAY AND STOOD ON THE GROUND WITH THEIR NECKS AND BILLS UPLIFTED AND MOUTHS OPEN
AND THEIR LONG LEGS GAVE THEM A VERY GENTEEL LOOK THE TOPS OF THEIR HEADS WERE COVERED WITH WARTY RED SKIN FROM WHICH GREW SHORT BLACK FEATHERS THAT LOOKED MORE LIKE HAIRS ONE MORNING WHEN THE CRANES AWAKENED
THEN HE THOUGHT THAT IF SHE LIKED THE PLACE SO WELL SHE MIGHT COME THERE AGAIN THE NEXT DAY HE WONDERED WHY HE COULD NOT COME TOO ALTHOUGH EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT A CRANE CATCHES MORE IF HE FISHES ALONE THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE CRANES DANCED
IF HE HAD BEEN AN OLDER CRANE AND UNDERSTOOD THE WAYS OF THE WORLD A LITTLE BETTER HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE MEANT AREN'T YOU COMING TO THAT FISHING PLACE I AM GOING NOW
AND THAT HE HAD A BAD HABIT OF USING HIS STOUT SUCKING TUBE TO STING WITH STILL BELOSTOMA DID NOT CARE HE SAID A GIANT WATER BUG DOES NOT ALWAYS LIVE IN THE WATER I SHALL HAVE MY WINGS SOON AND LEAVE THE WATER AND MARRY
SHE COULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING AND SHE KNEW IT SHE TALKED ABOUT IT TOO AND THAT SHOWED BAD TASTE AND WAS ONE REASON WHY SHE WAS NOT LIKED BETTER SHE COULD SWIM VERY FAST COULD CREEP GLIDE
I THINK THE DUCKS SPOIL THEIR CHILDREN SAID SHE THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS OVER THEM AND THEY ARE NOT NEARLY SO BRIGHT AS MY CHILDREN WHY MINE HATCH AS SOON AS THE EGGS ARE LAID AND GO HUNTING AT ONCE THEY ARE NO TROUBLE AT ALL
THEY CERTAINLY ARE AGREED THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHO WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MUCH BETTER NATURED WHAT DID YOU SAY ASKED THE ADDER WHO LIKE ALL HER FAMILY WAS A LITTLE DEAF OUCH EXCLAIMED THE SNAPPING TURTLE
OUCH OUCH WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED THE MUD TURTLE THEN HE BEGAN TO SLAP THE WATER WITH HIS SHORT STOUT TAIL AND SAY OUCH
BUT THEN YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT STUPID OF COURSE NOT REPLIED THE MUD TURTLE
ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS OF WHICH HE TOLD HAD HAPPENED BEFORE HE CAME TO THE MEADOW
SHE PUT ME IN A VERY QUEER PRISON AT FIRST WHEN SHE PUT ME DOWN ON A STONE IN SOME WATER I DID NOT KNOW THAT I WAS IN PRISON I TRIED TO HOP AWAY AND BUMP WENT MY HEAD AGAINST SOMETHING
I HAD ENOUGH TO EAT BUT ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN FREE CANNOT BE HAPPY SHUT IN I WATCHED MY CHANCE AND THREE TIMES I GOT OUT WHEN THE LITTLE DOOR WAS NOT QUITE CLOSED TWICE I WAS CAUGHT AND PUT BACK
BUT FOR A LONG TIME I COULD NOT SLEEP WITHOUT DREAMING THAT I WAS BACK IN PRISON AND I WOULD CROAK IN MY SLEEP AT THE THOUGHT OF IT I HEARD YOU CRIED THE KATYDID AND I WONDERED WHAT WAS THE MATTER MATTER ENOUGH SAID THE TREE FROG
THE DIGNIFIED WALKING STICKS THREE WALKING STICKS FROM THE FOREST HAD COME TO LIVE IN THE BIG MAPLE TREE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE MEADOW NOBODY KNEW EXACTLY WHY THEY HAD LEFT THE FOREST WHERE ALL THEIR SISTERS AND COUSINS AND AUNTS LIVED
PERHAPS THEY CAN'T HELP BEING FAT BUT THEY MIGHT AT LEAST ACT GENTEEL WHAT IS IT TO BE GENTEEL ASKED A GRASSHOPPER SUDDENLY HE HAD HEARD EVERY WORD THAT THE WALKING STICK SAID WHY SAID THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK
TO THE FINAL EXECUTION OF THE LAW SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD FOLLOW IT ALL IN HIS MOVEMENTS AND THE EXPRESSIONS OF HIS COUNTENANCE AT A CERTAIN POINT THE COLD DEW ALWAYS APPEARED ON HIS FOREHEAD
THE NEXT A GUSH OF GLADNESS WOULD SWELL HER HEART AT THE THOUGHT THAT NOW SHE HAD HIM AT LEAST SAFER FOR A WHILE AND THAT HE MIGHT DIE AND SO ESCAPE THE WHOLE CROWD OF HORRIBLE POSSIBILITIES
BUT AMONGST THE REST A FEELING WHICH HAD BUT LATELY BEGUN TO INDICATE ITS FAR OFF PRESENCE NOW THREATENED TO BRING WITH IT A DEEPER AND MORE PERMANENT SORROW IT BECAME MORE AND MORE PLAIN TO HER
HE BECAME MORE AND MORE INTERESTED IN THE WOMAN WHO COULD LOVE SO STRONGLY AND YET NOT ENTIRELY WHO SUFFERED AND MUST STILL SUFFER SO MUCH AND WHO A FAITH EVEN NO GREATER THAN HIS OWN MIGHT RENDER COMPARATIVELY BLESSED
THEN WOULD MEN SOON UNDERSTAND THAT NOT THE FORM OF EVEN SOUNDEST WORDS AVAILETH ANYTHING BUT A NEW CREATURE WHEN WINGFOLD WAS IN THE PULPIT THEN HE COULD SPEAK AS FROM THE SECRET TO THE SECRET BUT ELSEWHERE HE FELT
IN REGARD TO HELEN LIKE A TRANSPORT SHIP FILLED WITH TROOPS WHICH MUST GO SAILING AROUND THE SHORES OF AN INVADED ALLY
CONSCIOUS LIFE SPRINGING THEREFROM BUT WAS HE NOT NOW MAKING PEOPLE SUPPOSE HIM MORE CERTAIN OF THE FACT OF THESE THINGS THAN HE WAS
NO HARM WOULD FOLLOW WAS A MAN NEVER TO TALK FROM THE HIGHEST IN HIM TO THE FORGETTING OF THE LOWER WAS A MAN NEVER TO BE CARRIED BEYOND HIMSELF AND THE REGIONS OF HIS KNOWLEDGE IF SO THEN FAREWELL POETRY AND PROPHECY
NOTHING COULD SATISFY HIM OF THAT LESS THAN THE CONSCIOUS PRESENCE OF THE PERFECT CHARITY WITHOUT THAT HE WAS STILL OUTSIDE THE KINGDOM WANDERING IN A DREAM AROUND ITS WALLS
AND WITH EVERY FRESH CONFLICT EVERY FRESH GLEAM OF DOUBTFUL VICTORY THE ESSENTIAL IDEA OF THE MASTER LOOKED MORE AND MORE LOVELY AND HE BEGAN TO SEE THE WORKING OF HIS DOUBTS ON THE GROWTH OF HIS HEART AND SOUL
CHAPTER EIGHT DUCO VAN DER STAAL HAD TAKEN A LARGE VAULT LIKE STUDIO WITH A CHILLY NORTH LIGHT UP THREE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS IN THE VIA DEL BABUINO HERE HE PAINTED MODELLED AND STUDIED
IN THE LITTLE SHOPS ALONG THE TIBER OR IN THE MERCATO DEI FIORI THAT WAS HIS PASSION TO HUNT THROUGH ROME FOR A PANEL OF AN OLD TRIPTYCH OR A FRAGMENT OF ANCIENT SCULPTURE
IN THIS WAY HIS STUDIO HAD NOT REMAINED THE LARGE CHILLY VAULT LIKE WORKROOM BEARING WITNESS TO ZEALOUS AND SERIOUS STUDY BUT HAD BECOME A REFUGE FOR DIM COLOURED REMNANTS OF ANTIQUITY
ROMAN LIFE CAME INTO BEING WITH A TOGA'D GESTURE A LINE OF HORACE A SUDDEN VISION OF AN EMPEROR'S MURDER
EATEN UP WITH AGE CRUMBLED MARTYRED MUTILATED WITH HAMMERS TILL ONLY A FEW OCCASIONAL PILLARS LIFTED AND BORE A TREMBLING ARCHITRAVE THAT THREATENED TO COME CRASHING TO THE GROUND
AND EVEN AS HE LOVED ROAMING ALONE AMONG THE RUINS AND ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS SO HE CHERISHED THE PRIVACY OF HIS LONELY STUDIO WITH THE MANY SILENT FIGURES ON AN OLD PANEL OF SOME TRIPTYCH
OR A SHADOWY ANTIQUE CABINET AND IN BETWEEN ALL THIS LIVED HIS CHINA AND BRONZE AND OLD SILVER WHILE THE FADED GOLD EMBROIDERY OF AN ECCLESIASTICAL VESTMENT GLEAMED FAINTLY
BEING BY NATURE A LITTLE SHY OF BAEDEKERED TOURISTS OF SHORT SKIRTED ENGLISH LADIES WITH THEIR PERSISTENT LITTLE EXCLAMATIONS OF UNIFORM ADMIRATION AND FEELING ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE IN THE HALF ITALIAN
AGAINST THE PRERAPHAELITE STIFFNESS OF LINE
CAREFULLY WINNOWING AWAY THE CHAFF OF HYPOTHESIS AND DISCARDING THE TARES OF FABLE WHICH ARE TOO APT TO SPRING UP AND CHOKE THE SEEDS OF TRUTH AND WHOLESOME KNOWLEDGE HAD I BEEN ANXIOUS TO CAPTIVATE THE SUPERFICIAL THRONG
THEY HAVE PERISHED FROM REMEMBRANCE FOR WANT OF A HISTORIAN THE PHILANTHROPIST MAY WEEP OVER THEIR DESOLATION THE POET MAY WANDER AMONG THEIR MOULDERING ARCHES AND BROKEN COLUMNS
SALVATION ARMY A DRUM POUNDS OUT THE HYMN LOUD WITH GAUDY ANGELS TINSEL CHERUBIM TO DROWN THE FANFARE OF THE STREET AND WITH EXULTANT LILTING BEAT
AN OLD ITALIAN PAINTER LABORIOUSLY HAS PLAYED HIS SOUL AWAY HIS LOVE ALL HIS DESIRE FOR FRAGRANT THINGS AFAR FROM EARTH SHINES THE MADONNA AS WITH A VEIL OVERLAID BY INCENSE SMOKE AND DUST AGE OLD
EDUCATION AGREED THAT UNLESS SOMETHING WERE CHANGED DISASTER WOULD COME TO THE NATION YOU SMILED WHEN I POINTED WHERE A GROUP OF BIRCHES SHIVERED IN THE GREEN WOOD SHADOW UP TO THEIR KNEES IN WATER
THE LAKE WAVES WERE FLAKES OF RED GOLD BURNISHED TO COPPER GOLD RED AS THE TANGLED GLEAM OF SUNLIGHT IN YOUR HAIR SATURNALIA
TO EARTH'S BROOD OF SOULS OF OLD WITH COVERED HEADS AND ASPEN WANDS MIST SHROUDED PRIESTS DO ANCIENT RITES THE BLACK RAM'S FLEECE IS STAINED WITH BLOOD THAT STEAMS DULL RED ON THE FROZEN GROUND
AND PALE VOTARIES SHIVER WITH THE COLD THAT NUMBS THE EARTH AND ETCHES PATTERNED MIRRORS ON THE PONDS WHAN THAT APRILLE
IS IT THE SONG OF A MEADOW LARK OFF THE BROWN SERE SALT MARSHES OR THE EAGER PATCHES IN DOORYARDS OF YELLOW AND PALE LILAC CROCUSES
I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS EVEN IF HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO READ WHAT WAS IN MY HEART HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR MY VOICE I WAS EVEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO WISH I KNEW GREEK BECAUSE PERHAPS HE WOULD UNDERSTAND ME BETTER IF I WERE TO PRAY IN GREEK
SHE TRIED HARD BUT COULD NOT PREVENT A SOB
THEREFORE SURELY THE FIRST STEP FOR ANYONE WHO HAS COMMITTED SUCH A CRIME MUST BE TO HUMBLE HIMSELF BEFORE GOD CONFESS THE SIN AND ASK FORGIVENESS AND CLEANSING
THEN YOU THINK CONFESSION TO GOD IS ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IF THERE BE NO ONE ELSE WRONGED TO WHOM CONFESSION CAN BE MADE IF THE CASE WERE MINE
BUT SHE MUST TAKE CARE THAT FOOLISH EXTRAVAGANT CURATE SHOULD NOT COME NEAR HIM THERE WAS NO KNOWING TO WHAT HE MIGHT PERSUADE HIM POOR POLDIE WAS SO EASILY LED BY ANY SHOW OF NOBILITY ANYTHING THAT LOOKED GRAND OR SELF SACRIFICING
SKELETONS THEY WERE AND NO HUMAN BEINGS AT ALL HER FATHER
SUDDENLY HOWEVER IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT THE CURATE HAD HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND HAD THEREFORE BEEN COMPELLED TO TALK AT RANDOM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE SHOULD SUSPECT THE CRIME OF WHICH HER BROTHER HAD BEEN GUILTY
NO SHE WOULD VENTURE NO FARTHER SOONER WOULD SHE GO TO GEORGE BASCOMBE FROM WHOM SHE NOT ONLY COULD LOOK FOR NO SPIRITUAL COMFORT BUT WHOSE THEORIES WERE SO CRUEL AGAINST CULPRITS OF ALL SORTS
ALAS ALAS SHE WAS ALONE ABSOLUTELY ALONE IN THE GREAT WASTE DEATH EYED UNIVERSE BUT FOR A MAN TO TALK SO OF THE TENDERNESS OF JESUS CHRIST
INSTEAD OF ANY WORD OR THOUGHT EVEN COMING TO HER THAT MIGHT BE FANCIED AN ANSWER SHE WAS SCARED FROM HER KNEES BY AN APPROACHING STEP
HELEN ROSE AND HASTENED TO HER BROTHER WITH A HEART OF LEAD IN HER BODY SHE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW HIM SOME CHANGE HAD PASSED ON HIM SINCE THE MORNING
WHAT WAS THAT POLDIE ASKED HELEN WITH A PANG OF FEAR WHY THOSE WORDS OF COURSE WHAT ELSE YOU SANG THEM TO ME AFTERWARDS YOU KNOW HELEN
OH I WISH I HADN'T RUN AWAY BUT HAD LET THEM TAKE ME AND HANG ME HELEN FELT HERSELF GROW WHITE SHE TURNED AWAY AND PRETENDED TO SEARCH FOR SOMETHING SHE HAD DROPPED
NOT IF I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING LEOPOLD HISSED FROM BETWEEN HIS TEETH IN THE STRUGGLE TO KEEP DOWN A SHRIEK NO NOT IF YOU TOLD HIM EVERYTHING SHE ANSWERED AND FELT LIKE A JUDGE CONDEMNING HIM TO DEATH
AND WALKED WITH HIM THROUGH THE GARDEN WINGFOLD DID NOT SPEAK YOU DON'T THINK VERY BADLY OF MY POOR BROTHER DO YOU MISTER WINGFOLD SAID HELEN MEEKLY IT IS A TERRIBLE FATE HE RETURNED
INTO THE LIFE I HOPE YOUR BROTHER WILL ENTER I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T HATE HIM HATE HIM WHO BUT A DEMON COULD HATE HIM HELEN LIFTED A GRATEFUL LOOK FROM EYES THAT SWAM IN TEARS
WAS IT RUDIMENTARY THANKFULNESS TO THE FATHER OF HER SPIRIT AS SHE STOOD GAZING WITH THE LOOK OF A MOTHER OVER HER SICK CHILD HE LIFTED HIS EYELIDS AND SMILED A SAD SMILE WHEN DID YOU COME INTO THE ROOM HE SAID A MINUTE AGO SHE ANSWERED
I DID NOT HEAR YOU HE RETURNED NO YOU WERE ASLEEP NOT I MISTER WINGFOLD IS ONLY JUST GONE I HAVE LET HIM OUT ON THE MEADOW SINCE LEOPOLD STARED LOOKED HALF ALARMED AND THEN SAID
I KNOW I TOOK TO YOU AT FIRST SIGHT I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU WHEN I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY A LONELY LITTLE FOREIGNER AND YOU A GREAT BEAUTIFUL LADY FOR SUCH YOU SEEMED TO ME THOUGH YOU HAVE TOLD ME SINCE YOU WERE ONLY A GREAT GAWKY GIRL
GOOD AND KIND AND STRONG AS HE IS EVEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE ME FORGET YOU HELEN BUT NEITHER YOU NOR I CAN DO WITHOUT MISTER WINGFOLD ANY MORE I FANCY I WISH YOU LIKED HIM BETTER
AND NOT AT ALL TOO CLOSE THEN THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE CAME HURRYING OVER THE SAND WITH A RATHER CROSS LOOK IN HIS EYES AND PUTTING HIS FEET DOWN A LITTLE HARDER THAN HE NEEDED TO QUITE AS THOUGH HE WERE OUT OF PATIENCE ABOUT SOMETHING WHY DIDN'T YOU TURTLES WAIT FOR ME
WHY ARE YOU NOT UP HERE WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE ASKED SUDDENLY OF THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE WHO WAS TRYING TO MAKE A PLACE FOR HIMSELF ON THE LOG THEY DIDN'T WAIT FOR ME HE SAID I WAS COMING RIGHT ALONG BUT THEY WOULDN'T WAIT I THINK THEY ARE JUST AS MEA
YET DOWN IN HIS LITTLE TURTLE HEART HE THOUGHT NOW THEY ARE GOING TO CATCH IT HE WAS SURE HIS MOTHER WAS GOING TO SCOLD THE OTHER TURTLE CHILDREN FOR LEAVING HIM HE WANTED TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD DO SO HE LOOKED OUT OF HIS RIGHT EYE AT THE TEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON THAT SIDE
AND THE NINE BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON HIS LEFT SIDE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF THEIR RIGHT EYES HE DREW IN HIS HEAD AND HIS TAIL AND HIS LEGS UNTIL ALL THEY COULD SEE WAS HIS ROUNDED UPPER SHELL HIS SHELL SIDE WALLS AND THE YELLOW EDGE OF HIS FLAT LOWER SHELL
AND YOU SHE ADDED TURNING TO HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS MUST BE PATIENT WITH HIM WE SHALL NOT HAVE HIM WITH US LONG
THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED BY WHAT HIS MOTHER HAD SAID AND FOR A FEW DAYS HE TRIED TO KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM AND SO HE GREW CARELESS AND MADE PEOPLE WAIT FOR HIM JUST BECAUSE HE WAS NOT QUITE READY TO GO WITH THEM
THEIR MOTHER WAS WITH SOME OF HER FRIENDS ON ANOTHER LOG NEAR BY SHE LOOKED OFTEN AT HER CHILDREN AND THOUGHT HOW HANDSOME THEIR ROUNDED UP BACK SHELLS WERE IN THE SUNSHINE WITH THE LITTLE RED AND YELLOW MARKINGS SHOWING ON THE BLACK
SHE COULD SEE THEIR STRONG LITTLE POINTED TAILS TOO AND THEIR WEBBED FEET WITH A STOUT CLAW ON EACH TOE SHE WAS SO PROUD THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP TALKING ABOUT THEM
AND SLID INTO THE WATER ALL HER FRIENDS FOLLOWING HER THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE SAW THESE GREAT ANIMALS COMING TOWARD HIM HE SPRAWLED OFF THE END OF HIS LOG AND SLID INTO THE WATER AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS FOLLOWED HIM EXCEPT THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
HE WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO SLIP FROM THE LOG TO THE WATER IF ANYTHING SCARED THEM AND WHEN ONE DAY A STRANGE TURTLE FROM ANOTHER POND CAME TO VISIT HE SAID TO THE TURTLES WHO HAD ALWAYS LIVED THERE
ON THE OCCASION OF THE RETURN OF THE AMISTAD CAPTORS TO THEIR NATIVE LAND AND NOW DOING SO MUCH FOR THE FREEDMEN OF THE SOUTH WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY ESTABLISHED BY HIS EFFORTS DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF SLAVERY MUCH WAS DONE BY THIS SOCIETY
THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FOR AIDING AND BEFRIENDING FUGITIVES OF WHICH I WAS TREASURER FOR MANY YEARS HAD NO BETTER OR WARMER FRIEND THAN HE HE WAS ALMOST ALWAYS AT THEIR MEETINGS WHICH WERE KNOWN ONLY TO THE ELECT FOR WE DARED NOT HOLD THEM TOO PUBLICLY
AS WE ALMOST ALWAYS HAD SOME OF THE TRAVELERS TOWARD THE NORTH STAR PRESENT WHOSE MASTERS OR THEIR AGENTS WERE FREQUENTLY IN THE CITY IN HOT PURSUIT AT FIRST WE SENT THEM TO CANADA BUT AFTER A WHILE SENT THEM ONLY TO SYRACUSE AND THE CENTRE OF THE STATE
BUT HEARING THAT THERE WERE A FEW LOADED MUSKETS THERE THEY TOOK IT OUT IN THREATS BUT THEIR MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENT WAS ALMOST OSTRACISED AT THIS TIME BY THE DRY GOODS MERCHANTS
WHOM THEY HAD HIRED TO CONDUCT THEM WITHOUT THE LIMITS OF THE CITY IN THE EVENING WHEN THE POLICE FORCE WAS CHANGED THEY CAME THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW JERSEY TO MY OFFICE
AND BY DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO CANADA TWO
IF I WOULD COME TO HIM IN THE EVENING I DID SO AND WAS HID AND FED BY HIM AND ON LANDING AT NEW YORK HE CONDUCTED ME TO MISSUS SMITH'S HOUSE WHERE I AM NOW STAYING
MOST OF THE TEACHERS WERE WARM HEARTED ABOLITIONISTS AND THE WHOLE NUMBER TAUGHT IN THIS SCHOOL DURING THIS PERIOD WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED
HE TOLD ME I SHOULD BE FREE ONE SUNDAY MORNING I RECEIVED A LETTER INFORMING ME THAT AN OFFICER BELONGING TO SAVANNAH GA HAD STARTED FOR NEW YORK IN PURSUIT OF TWO YOUNG MEN OF NINETEEN OR TWENTY
AND WHO HAD ESCAPED AND WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN NEW YORK THE LETTER REQUESTED ME TO FIND THEM AND GIVE THEM WARNING AS THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST I CONCLUDED TO GO OVER TO NEW YORK NOTWITHSTANDING THE DOUBTFULNESS OF ATTEMPTING TO FIND THEM IN SO LARGE A CITY
I STATED MY ERRAND TO HIM WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE YOUNG MEN WHY SAID HE I MUST HAVE ONE OF THEM IN MY SCHOOL HE TOOK ME TO A CLASS WHERE I FOUND ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN TO WHOM I GAVE THE NEEDFUL INFORMATION
AND THIS WAS THE CASE WITH MOTHER MAGPIE SHE WAS ALWAYS FULL OF EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS BUT HER OWN UP AND DOWN HERE AND THERE EVERYWHERE BUT IN HER OWN NEST KNOWING EVERYONE'S AFFAIRS TELLING WHAT EVERYBODY HAD BEEN DOING OR OUGHT TO DO
AND READY TO CAST HER ADVICE GRATIS AT EVERY BIRD AND BEAST OF THE WOODS NOW SHE BUSTLED UP TO THE PARSONAGE AT THE TOP OF THE OAK TREE TO TELL OLD PARSON TOO WHIT WHAT SHE THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO PREACH FOR HIS NEXT SERMON AND HOW DREADFUL THE MORALS OF THE PARISH WERE BECOMING
NOW YOU COMPLAIN ALWAYS THAT YOUR HEAD ACHES WHENEVER I CALL UPON YOU IT'S ALL ON ACCOUNT OF THIS WAY OF SWINGING AND SWAYING ABOUT IN SUCH AN ABSURD MANNER BUT MY DEAR
O MISSUS MAGPIE PRAY DON'T SPEAK TO MY HUSBAND HE WILL THINK I'VE BEEN COMPLAINING NO NO HE WON'T LET ME ALONE I UNDERSTAND JUST HOW TO SAY THE THING I'VE ADVISED HUNDREDS OF YOUNG HUSBANDS IN MY DAY AND I NEVER GAVE OFFENCE
BUT THEN HE HAD A WEAKNESS FOR CONCERTS AND GENERAL SOCIETY BECAUSE HE WAS HELD TO BE BY ALL ODDS THE HANDSOMEST BIRD IN THE WOODS AND SUNG LIKE AN ANGEL AND SO THE TRUTH WAS HE DIDN'T CONFINE HIMSELF SO MUCH TO THE DOMESTIC NEST AS TOM TITMOUSE OR BILLY WREN
THE FACT IS QUOTH TOMMY I AM A SOCIETY BIRD AND NATURE HAS MARKED OUT FOR ME A COURSE BEYOND THE RANGE OF THE COMMONPLACE AND MY WIFE MUST LEARN TO ACCOMMODATE IF SHE HAS A BRILLIANT HUSBAND
MY WIFE WAS ALL WELL ENOUGH CONTENT TILL OLD MOTHER MAGPIE INTERFERED IT IS QUITE MY DUTY TO TAKE STRONG GROUND AND SHOW THAT I CANNOT BE DICTATED TO
LIVED THE OLD MUSIC TEACHER DOCTOR BULLFROG THE POOR OLD DOCTOR WAS A SIMPLE MINDED GOOD AMIABLE CREATURE WHO HAD PLAYED THE DOUBLE BASS AND LED THE FOREST CHOIR ON ALL PUBLIC OCCASIONS SINCE NOBODY KNOWS WHEN
LATTERLY SOME YOUNGSTERS HAD ARISEN WHO SNEERED AT HIS PERFORMANCES AS BEHIND THE AGE IN FACT SINCE A GREAT CITY HAD GROWN UP IN THE VICINITY OF THE FOREST TRIBES OF WANDERING BOYS BROKE UP THE SIMPLE TASTES AND QUIET HABITS
ADAPT IT TO MODERN TIMES EVERYBODY NOW IS A LITTLE TOUCHED WITH THE OPERATIC FEVER AND THERE'S TOMMY ORIOLE HAS BEEN TO NEW ORLEANS AND BROUGHT BACK A TOUCH OF THE ARTISTIC IF YOU WOULD TRY HIS STYLE A LITTLE SOMETHING TYROLEAN YOU SEE
DEAR MADAM CONSIDER MY VOICE I NEVER COULD HIT THE HIGH NOTES HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S ALL PRACTICE TOMMY ORIOLE SAYS SO JUST TRY THE SCALES AS TO YOUR VOICE YOUR MANNER OF LIVING HAS A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH IT
I ALWAYS DID TELL YOU THAT YOUR PASSION FOR WATER INJURED YOUR SINGING SUPPOSE TOMMY ORIOLE SHOULD SIT HALF HIS DAYS UP TO HIS HIPS IN WATER AS YOU DO HIS VOICE WOULD BE AS HOARSE AND ROUGH AS YOURS COME UP ON THE BANK AND LEARN TO PERCH AS WE BIRDS DO
THEIR INTERLOCKING BRANCHES HIDING THE GIRL TOM DID SEE CROWDS OF OTHER PERSONS THOUGH THRONGING THE STREETS OF SHOPTON FOR THOUGH THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD MADE MANY FLIGHTS THERE WAS ALWAYS A NOVELTY ABOUT THEM THAT BROUGHT OUT THE CURIOUS
COMPLIMENTED MISTER PARKER IS IT ALWAYS AS EASY AS THIS STARTING ALWAYS IS WAS THE ANSWER THOUGH AS THE IRISHMAN SAID COMING DOWN ISN'T SOMETIMES QUITE SO COMFORTABLE BLESS MY GIZZARD THAT'S SO
OBSERVED THE DIAMOND MAN AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WOULD BE FRIGHTENED BUT I'M NOT A BIT IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN SOMETHING IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN SOON SAID MISTER PARKER SUDDENLY
AND TOM COULD NOT HELP WISHING THAT THE SCIENTIST WOULD KEEP HIS GLOOMY FOREBODINGS TO HIMSELF HOWEVER THE STORM HAD NOT DEVELOPED UP TO NOON WHEN TOM WITH MISTER DAMON'S HELP SERVED A FINE MEAL IN THE DINING ROOM IN THE AFTERNOON THE SPEED OF THE SHIP WAS INCREASED
AND BY NIGHT THEY HAD COVERED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES THROUGH THE DARKNESS THE RED CLOUD KEPT ON MAKING GOOD TIME TOM GOT UP OCCASIONALLY TO LOOK TO THE MACHINERY
HE WAS READY TO SERVE HIS GUESTS BEFORE HE FORWARDED HIS OWN WIRELESS NOTES JUST TELL MY WIFE THAT I'M ENJOYING MYSELF REQUESTED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY FOOTSTOOL BUT THIS IS GREAT WE'RE OFF THE EARTH YET
CONNECTED WITH IT MISTER JENKS HAD NO ONE TO WHOM HE WANTED TO SEND ANY WORD BUT MISTER PARKER WISH TO WIRE TO A FELLOW SCIENTIST THE RESULT OF SOME OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THE UPPER AIR TOM NOTED ALL THE MESSAGES DOWN
I THINK THAT ALL HE IS WAITING FOR IS A FAVORABLE CHANCE DECLARED THE DIAMOND SEEKER HE WOULD DESTROY THE CRAFT AND US TOO IF HE COULD PREVENT US FROM DISCOVERING THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN I BELIEVE
THEN WE MUST GET AHEAD OF HIM DECIDED TOM QUIETLY I HAVE JUST FLASHED TO DAD A MESSAGE TELLING HIM THAT WE WILL HEED HIS WARNING NOW TO CAPTURE THE STOWAWAY
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CAPTURE HIM ASKED MISTER PARKER IF HE HAS A GUN IT WON'T BE ANY TOO EASY TO GO IN THE STOREROOM AND DRAG HIM OUT WE'LL HAVE TO USE A LITTLE STRATEGY DECIDED TOM AND THEN THEY DISCUSSED SEVERAL PLANS
THEN I'LL HELP YOU GET IT OUT BLESS MY FRYING PAN BUT I AM VERY FOND OF LOBSTER EXCLAIMED MISTER DAMON IN AS NATURAL TONES AS WAS POSSIBLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
HE WAS AWARE OF A MOVEMENT IN A LITTLE SPACE FORMED BY ONE BOX WHICH WAS PLACED ON TOP OF TWO OTHERS THE LAD SAW A DARK FIGURE MOVING AS IF TO GET FARTHER OUT OF SIGHT I'VE GOT HIM CRIED TOM MAKING A DIVE FOR THE SHADOW
THE CORDS WERE PRODUCED AND THE MAN WHO HAD NOW CEASED TO STRUGGLE WAS TIGHTLY BOUND HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT HE SMILED GRIMLY WHEN MISTER DAMON REMARKED I GUESS I'LL GO BACK IN THE STOREROOM TOM AND SEE HOW MUCH FOOD HE ATE
HE WAS IN WITH THE DIAMOND MAKERS SAID MISTER JENKS HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO TOOK ME TO THE SECRET CAVE BUT IT WILL BE THE LAST TIME HE EVER GOES THERE HOW HIGH UP ARE WE TOM ABOUT TWO MILES WHY
THROW ME OVER WITH THE AIRSHIP TWO MILES HIGH ARE YOU GASPED THE MAN WILL YOU TELL US WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IF WE DON'T ASKED MISTER JENKS
WAS DROPPED OFF THE AIRSHIP WHEN IT WAS SENT DOWN TO WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE EARTH IT WILL TAKE YOU SOME TIME TO GET TO A TELEGRAPH OFFICE SAID MISTER JENKS AS A PACKAGE OF FOOD AND A FLASK OF WATER WAS TOSSED DOWN TO THE STOWAWAY
HE SHOOK HIS FIST AT THOSE IN THE AIRSHIP AND SHOUTED AFTER THEM YOU'LL NEVER DISCOVER THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN
MARTHA WITHDREW WITH THE CHILD AND JUST THEN CAROLINE CAME IN FULL OF EAGERNESS MISS CHANNING MAMMA SAYS SHE SHALL TAKE ONE OF US TO THE MISSIONARY MEETING WHICHEVER YOU CHOOSE TO FIX UPON MIND YOU FIX UPON ME
AND COME HERE AT SEVEN VERY WELL SAID LADY AUGUSTA I SUPPOSE THIS WILL ONLY APPLY TO THE SUMMER MONTHS ONE OF THE GIRLS SHALL GO WITH US TO DAY WHICHEVER DESERVES IT BEST YOU ARE NOT LEAVING ONE OF THEM AT HOME TO MAKE ROOM FOR ME I HOPE LADY AUGUSTA
IT WILL BE ONLY RIGHT TO DO SO SUPPOSE WE ARE BOTH GOOD AND MERIT IT EQUALLY SUGGESTED FANNY
THERE IS SO MUCH ILL TO UNDO CAROLINE IS THE WORST THE WEEDS WITH HER HAVE HAD LONGER TIME TO GET AHEAD I THINK PERHAPS IF I COULD KEEP HER WHOLLY WITH ME FOR A TWELVEMONTH OR SO WATCHING OVER HER CONSTANTLY A GREAT DEAL MIGHT BE EFFECTED
REPLIED MISTER CHANNING I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HIS EXPERIENCE IN ANOTHER LINE MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU CONTINUED MISTER YORKE
BUT HE HAS BEEN RESTORED IN A WONDERFUL MANNER AND IS IN SOUND HEALTH AGAIN AND WHAT REMEDIES DID HE USE EAGERLY ASKED MISTER CHANNING A THREE MONTHS RESIDENCE AT SOME MEDICINAL SPRINGS IN GERMANY NOTHING ELSE WHEN I SAY NOTHING ELSE OF COURSE I MUST IMPLY THAT HE WAS UNDER MEDICAL TREATMENT THERE
IT IS THE VERY THING YOU SEE SIR THAT HAS BEEN ORDERED FOR YOU AY SIGHED MISTER CHANNING FEELING HOW VERY FAINT APPEARED TO BE THE HOPE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING IT I WAS MENTIONING YOUR CASE TO HIM OBSERVED MISTER YORKE
DOCTOR LAMB SAYS THE COST WAS SO TRIFLING AS SCARCELY TO BE CREDITED CONTINUED MISTER YORKE IN A TONE OF REMONSTRANCE ARTHUR DON'T YOU CARE TO HELP TO SAVE HIM I WOULD MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO SAVE MY FATHER IMPULSIVELY SPOKE ARTHUR
DID YOU THINK I WAS LOST I WAS SEDUCED INTO JOINING YOUR MISSIONARY MEETING PEOPLE AND HAVE HAD TO STOP LATE AT THE OFFICE TO MAKE UP FOR IT
I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED THAT I WAS ABLE TO RISE ABOUT NOON AND GO INTO MY STUDY THOUGH I WAS VERY WEAK AND HAD NOT YET BEEN OUT WHEN ONE MORNING MISSUS PEARSON CAME INTO THE ROOM AND SAID PLEASE SIR
CONFIDENT THERE MUST BE A GOOD REASON FOR IT AND SO TOLD MISSUS PEARSON TO SHOW HIM IN OH SIR I KNOW YOU WOULD BE VEXED IF YOU HADN'T BEEN TOLD HE EXCLAIMED AND I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR TROUBLING YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER TOM I SAID
THERE WAS A LITTLE CHAPEL DOWN A LANE LEADING FROM THE MAIN STREET OF THE VILLAGE IN WHICH THERE WAS SERVICE THREE TIMES EVERY SUNDAY
PARTLY OF A DREAD LEST WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ON TOGETHER AND SO THE ATTEMPT SHOULD RESULT IN SOMETHING UNPLEASANTLY AWKWARD I DARESAY LIKEWISE THAT THE NATURAL SHELLINESS OF THE ENGLISH HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AT ALL EVENTS I HAD NOT MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE
I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND BUT THE BROKER WAS BEFORE ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE POCKETED THE MONEY JUMPED INTO HIS CART WITH HIS MAN AND DROVE OFF LEAVING THE CHURCHWARDEN AND THE PARSON STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE DISSENTING MINISTER WITH HIS MAHOGANY TABLE ON THE PATH BETWEEN THEM NOW MISTER BROWNRIGG I SAID
LEND ME A HAND TO CARRY THIS TABLE IN AGAIN HE YIELDED NOT GRACIOUSLY THAT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED BUT IN SILENCE OH SIR INTERPOSED YOUNG TOM WHO HAD STOOD BY DURING THE DISPUTE LET ME TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO LIFT IT
BUT WHEN WE ENTERED HE ROSE HE WAS A MAN OF MIDDLE SIZE ABOUT FORTY WITH SHORT BLACK HAIR AND OVERHANGING BUSHY EYEBROWS HIS MOUTH INDICATED GREAT FIRMNESS NOT UNMINGLED WITH SWEETNESS AND EVEN WITH HUMOUR HE SMILED AS HE ROSE BUT LOOKED EMBARRASSED
OUR LORD DID NOT REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR AUTHORITY NOTWITHSTANDING THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THEY HAD DEGRADED THE RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES OF THE JEWISH CHURCH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF A CHILD OF THE CHURCH BUT SAID THAT AS A CHILD HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE AS HE PLEASED
OR WHAT CAME TO THE SAME THING MAKE A SERVANT OF HIS FATHER NAMELY A FISH IN THE SEA OF GALILEE
MAY I HOPE THAT YOU WILL DO ME THE CREDIT TO BELIEVE THAT IF I SAW CLEARLY THAT THEY WERE THE SAME THING I WOULD NOT HESITATE A MOMENT TO FOLLOW OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE I BELIEVE IT PERFECTLY THEREFORE HOWEVER WE MAY DIFFER WE ARE IN REALITY AT NO STRIFE
A SILENCE FOLLOWED FOR I HAD TO DEAL WITH AN HONEST MAN WHO WAS THINKING I RESUMED A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES WILL NO DOUBT COME UP TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE MATTER DO NOT SUPPOSE I AM ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU I BELIEVE THAT OUR FATHER OUR ELDER BROTHER
WHICH ONLY COMES FROM YEARS OF SELF CONTROL WERE TOO LATELY AWAKENED IN HIS BREAST TO SUSTAIN HIM NOW AS STROKE AFTER STROKE FELL ON THE EAR HE FELT HIMSELF YIELDING BEYOND RECOVERY
WHEN FREDERICK LEAPING WITH A BOUND TO HIS FEET DREW ALL EYES TOWARDS HIMSELF WITH THE CRY LET ME BE PUT ON MY OATH I HAVE TESTIMONY TO GIVE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE THE CORONER WAS ASTOUNDED
HE DID NOT LOSE HIS DETERMINED ATTITUDE HE HAD OBSERVED A CHANGE IN AMABEL AND A CHANGE IN AGNES AND IF ONLY TO DISAPPOINT THE VILE TRIUMPH OF THE ONE
I CANNOT SAY I KNEW SHE HAD MONEY IN HER HOUSE THIS I HAD UNHAPPILY BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH IN AN ACCIDENTAL WAY
BUT THEY PASSED THANK GOD AND WITH NO MORE DESPERATE FEELING THAN A SULLEN INTENTION OF HAVING MY OWN WAY ABOUT THIS MONEY I LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE FRONT DOOR AND STEPPED IN
I SLIPPED UP THE NARROW STAIRCASE
GIVE THEN I WANT HUNDREDS THOUSANDS NOW NOW TO SAVE MYSELF DISGRACE SHAME PRISON AWAIT ME IF I DON'T HAVE THEM GIVE GIVE AND MY HAND WENT OUT TOWARD IT NOT TOWARD HER
MORE THAN THE OUTWARD SEEMING OF HER LIFE CAN HARDLY MEASURE PLUNGED AGAINST IT AND I CAN TELL YOU NO MORE HER BLOOD AND BATSY'S SHRIEK FROM THE ADJOINING ROOM SWAM THROUGH MY CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN SHE FELL AS I SUPPOSED
AND I IN SCARCELY BETTER CASE FELL ALSO THIS AS GOD LIVES IS THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE WOUND FOUND IN THE BREAST OF THIS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN WOMAN THE FEELING THE PATHOS THE ANGUISH EVEN TO BE FOUND IN HIS TONE MADE THIS STORY
SEEMED APPEAR FOR THE MOMENT PLAUSIBLE AND BATSY ASKED THE CORONER MUST HAVE FALLEN WHEN WE DID FOR I NEVER HEARD HER VOICE AFTER THE FIRST SCREAM BUT I SHALL SPEAK OF HER AGAIN
AND SHE PRIZED EVERY MOMENT REMAINING TO HER BECAUSE OF THE BLISS SHE ENJOYED OF SEEING
AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES CALCULATED TO DECEIVE MISTER SUTHERLAND CONSEQUENTLY HE HAD NEVER KNOWN I WAS NOT HIS OWN CHILD
BUT WHEN I ROSE TO LOOK FOR BATSY I FOUND THAT THE SHOCK OF HER MISTRESS'S FATAL ACT HAD KILLED HER
JAMES ZABEL MUCH LESS THAT IT BORE HIS INITIALS ON THE HANDLE HE PAUSED AND THE AWE OCCASIONED BY THE SCENE HE HAD DESCRIBED WAS SO DEEP AND THE SILENCE SO PROLONGED THAT A SHUDDER PASSED OVER THE WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE
BUT AS I HASTENED ON TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE ZABELS LIVED I WAS SEIZED BY SUCH COMPUNCTION FOR HIS DESOLATE STATE THAT I FALTERED IN MY RAPID FLIGHT AND DID NOT ARRIVE AT THE PLACE OF MY DESTINATION AS QUICKLY AS I INTENDED WHEN I DID
BUT I DID NOT TURN AWAY REMEMBERING MY MOTHER'S ANXIETY AN ANXIETY SO EXTREME IT DISTURBED HER FINAL MOMENTS I APPROACHED THE FRONT DOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO KNOCK WHEN I FOUND IT OPEN GREATLY ASTONISHED I AT ONCE PASSED IN
AS I DID SO HE GAVE A SIGH BUT DID NOT WAKE
I HASTENED AWAY AND TOOK THE SHORTEST PATH HOME HAD I BEEN MORE OF A MAN OR IF MY VISIT TO MISSUS WEBB HAD BEEN ACTUATED BY A MORE COMMUNICABLE MOTIVE I WOULD HAVE GONE AT ONCE TO THE GOOD MAN WHO BELIEVED ME TO BE OF HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
AND TOLD HIM OF THE STRANGE AND HEART RENDING ADVENTURE WHICH HAD CHANGED THE WHOLE TENOR OF MY THOUGHTS AND LIFE
AND THAT SOMETHING BESIDES JUSTICE HAD ACTUATED AMABEL IN HER TREATMENT OF THIS YOUNG MAN THIS FEELING WAS SHARED BY OTHERS AND A REACTION SET IN IN FREDERICK'S FAVOUR WHICH EVEN AFFECTED THE OFFICIALS WHO WERE CONDUCTING THE INQUIRY
THEY BUT EMPHASISED FACTS ALREADY KNOWN AND PRODUCED BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN THE GENERAL FEELING
WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO RESUME HIS SEAT
THAT SHE WAS STILL IN THE MAZE OF THE NUMBERLESS CONFLICTING EMOTIONS WHICH THESE REVELATIONS WERE CALCULATED TO CALL OUT IN ONE WHO HAD RISKED ALL ON THE HAZARD OF A DIE AND LOST SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW AT THIS MOMENT WHETHER SHE WAS GLAD OR SORRY HE COULD EXPLAIN SO CLEVERLY
HOW CONDUCT HERSELF UNDER QUESTIONS WHICH WOULD BE MUCH MORE SEARCHING NOW THAN BEFORE SHE COULD NOT EVEN DECIDE IN HER OWN MIND SHE MUST LET IMPULSE HAVE ITS WAY HAPPILY SHE TOOK THE RIGHT STAND AT FIRST
SHE DID NOT ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE ANY CORRECTIONS IN HER FORMER TESTIMONY ONLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE FLOWER WHOSE PRESENCE ON THE SCENE OF DEATH HAD BEEN SUCH A MYSTERY HAD FALLEN FROM HER HAIR AT THE BALL AND THAT SHE HAD SEEN FREDERICK PICK IT UP AND PUT IT IN HIS BUTTONHOLE
CHAPTER FIVE HOW AUGUSTINE WENT TO CARTHAGE AND HOW PATRICIUS DIED A CHRISTIAN DEATH AUGUSTINE'S YEAR AT HOME DID NOT DO FOR HIM WHAT MONICA HAD HOPED
BUT IT IS HARD TO TURN BACK ON THE DOWNHILL ROAD HE TELLS US HOW HE WENT ONE NIGHT WITH A BAND OF THESE WILD COMPANIONS TO ROB THE FRUIT TREE OF A POOR NEIGHBOUR IT WAS LADEN WITH PEARS
BUT HER TEACHING WAS NOT YET CLEAR TO HIM HIS OWN FEET WERE NOT FIRM ENOUGH IN THE WAYS OF CHRIST TO ENABLE HIM TO STRETCH A STEADYING HAND TO ANOTHER HIS MOTHER WAS FAILING FAST
HE SUPPOSED IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FULL OF SYMPATHY AND ALWAYS MADE ALLOWANCES AND THEN SHE SEEMED TO THINK TO BE SURE EVEN THAT IF ONE WENT ON TRYING FAILURES DID NOT MATTER
PATRICIUS WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT AUGUSTINE'S FUTURE ALL HIS EFFORTS HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN SAVING THE SUM REQUIRED FOR HIS FIRST YEAR AT CARTHAGE
SAID ROMANIANUS IT WAS AN HONOUR TO BE ALLOWED TO HELP IN HIS EDUCATION MONICA WAS ALMOST GLAD TO SEE HER SON DEPART THE OLD BOYISH LAZINESS HAD GIVEN WAY
EVERY DAY HIS SOUL WAS OPENING MORE AND MORE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF SPIRITUAL THINGS WHILE MONICA WATCHED THE TRANSFORMATION WITH A HEART THAT OVERFLOWED WITH GRATITUDE AND LOVE
THE SORROWS OF THE PAST WERE ALL FORGOTTEN IN THE JOY OF THE PRESENT THAT HAPPY UNION AT THE FEET OF CHRIST THERE WAS BUT ONE CAUSE FOR SADNESS PATRICIUS'S HEALTH WAS FAILING
HE DID NOT DECEIVE HIMSELF HE SPOKE OF HIS APPROACHING DEATH TO MONICA AND ASKED HER TO HELP HIM TO MAKE A WORTHY PREPARATION FOR BAPTISM WHICH HE DESIRED TO RECEIVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
A WONDERFUL PEACE POSSESSED HIM THE OLD LIFE WITH ALL ITS STAINS HAD PASSED FROM HIM IN THOSE CLEANSING WATERS THE NEW LIFE WAS AT HAND ONCE MORE HE ASKED HER
CHAPTER SIX HOW SAINT MONICA LIVED IN THE DAYS OF HER WIDOWHOOD AND HOW SHE PUT ALL HER TRUST IN GOD PATRICIUS HAD NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF WORLDLY GOODS TO LEAVE TO HIS WIFE
OF ACTING A FATHER'S PART TO AUGUSTINE UNTIL HE WAS FAIRLY LAUNCHED IN LIFE HE HAD A CHILD OF HIS OWN
IF MONICA WOULD BEFRIEND HIS BOY THEY WOULD BE QUITS THE GRATITUDE OF BOTH MOTHER AND SON TOWARDS THIS GENEROUS FRIEND AND BENEFACTOR LASTED THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
YOU IT WAS WHO WHEN I HAD THE SORROW TO LOSE MY FATHER COMFORTED ME BY YOUR FRIENDSHIP HELPED ME WITH YOUR ADVICE AND ASSISTED ME WITH YOUR FORTUNE
IN THEIR TASK OF WASHING AND ATTENDING TO THE SICK WATCHING BY THEIR BEDS AND CLEANING THEIR ROOMS THEIR MINISTRATIONS DID NOT EVEN CEASE THERE WITH REVERENT CARE THEY PREPARED THE DEAD FOR BURIAL
THEY CALLED HER MOTHER IT SEEMED SUCH A NATURAL NAME TO GIVE HER FOR SHE WAS A MOTHER TO THEM ALL AND GAVE THEM A MOTHER'S LOVE TO SOME OF THE POOR CREATURES FRIENDLESS SLAVES AS THEY OFTEN WERE
SHE WOULD KEEP THEM IN HER OWN HOUSE FEED THEM AT HER OWN TABLE AND CLOTHE THEM WITH HER OWN HANDS IF I AM A MOTHER TO THESE MOTHERLESS ONES SHE WOULD SAY TO HERSELF HE WILL HAVE MERCY AND GIVE ME BACK MY BOY
BUT GAVE IT ALL AWAY TO THE POOR OFTEN INDEED SHE WENT COLD AND HUNGRY THAT THEY MIGHT BE CLOTHED AND FED HER LOVE OF PRAYER TOO COULD NOW FIND FULL SCOPE
AND YET IN HER HEART OF HEARTS THERE WAS A DEEP CONVICTION THAT NO SAD NEWS OF HIS LIFE AT CARTHAGE COULD SHAKE HIS WAS NOT THE NATURE TO FIND CONTENTMENT IN THE THINGS OF EARTH
EVEN WITH THE HELP OF THE MOST LEARNED PROFESSORS AUGUSTINE EAGER TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS WONDERFUL WORK PROCURED IT AT ONCE AND READ IT IT SEEMED TO HIM PERFECTLY SIMPLE IT WAS UNNECESSARY HE FOUND
AND I KNEW NOT THAT IT WAS THOU THAT WAST WORKING IN ME ONE THING COOLED MY ARDOUR HE GOES ON TO SAY IT WAS THAT THE NAME OF CHRIST WAS NOT THERE AND THIS NAME BY THY MERCY LORD
OF THY SON MY SAVIOUR MY HEART HAD DRAWN IN WITH MY MOTHER'S MILK AND KEPT IN ITS DEPTHS AND EVERY DOCTRINE WHERE THIS NAME DID NOT APPEAR FLUENT ELEGANT AND TRUTH LIKE THOUGH IT MIGHT BE
COULD NOT MASTER ME ALTOGETHER HE THEN TURNED TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES BUT THEY APPEARED TO HIM INFERIOR IN STYLE TO CICERO MY PRIDE HE WRITES
AFTER THE DANCE AND OTHER GRAND REJOICINGS BOTH OF THE SINGING AND THE FLAMING FORTH EFFULGENCE WITH EFFULGENCE BLITHE AND TENDER TOGETHER AT ONCE WITH ONE ACCORD HAD STOPPED EVEN AS THE EYES THAT AS VOLITION MOVES THEM MUST NEEDS TOGETHER SHUT AND LIFT THEMSELVES
WHEN THE EMPEROR WHO REIGNETH EVERMORE PROVIDED FOR THE HOST THAT WAS IN PERIL THROUGH GRACE ALONE AND NOT THAT IT WAS WORTHY AND AS WAS SAID HE TO HIS BRIDE BROUGHT SUCCOUR WITH CHAMPIONS TWAIN AT WHOSE DEED AT WHOSE WORD THE STRAGGLING PEOPLE WERE TOGETHER DRAWN
SILENT AND WAKEFUL MANY A TIME WAS HE DISCOVERED BY HIS NURSE UPON THE GROUND AS IF HE WOULD HAVE SAID FOR THIS I CAME O THOU HIS FATHER FELIX VERILY O THOU HIS MOTHER VERILY JOANNA IF THIS INTERPRETED MEANS AS IS SAID
AND PETER MANGIADOR AND PETER OF SPAIN WHO DOWN BELOW IN VOLUMES TWELVE IS SHINING NATHAN THE SEER AND METROPOLITAN CHRYSOSTOM
THE MOMENT WHEN SHE FELT THE FROST OF DEATH AND ONE TO HAVE ITS RAYS WITHIN THE OTHER AND BOTH TO WHIRL THEMSELVES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE SHOULD FORWARD GO THE OTHER BACKWARD
THEN BROKE THE SILENCE OF THOSE SAINTS CONCORDANT THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE ADMIRABLE LIFE OF GOD'S OWN MENDICANT WAS TOLD TO ME AND SAID
THAT IT WEIGHS DOWN THE BALANCE OF ALL SIN WHATE'ER OF LIGHT IT HAS TO HUMAN NATURE BEEN LAWFUL TO POSSESS WAS ALL INFUSED BY THE SAME POWER THAT BOTH OF THEM CREATED AND HENCE AT WHAT I SAID ABOVE DOST WONDER
AFTER ITS KIND BEARS WORSE AND BETTER FRUIT AND YE ARE BORN WITH CHARACTERS DIVERSE IF IN PERFECTION TEMPERED WERE THE WAX AND WERE THE HEAVEN IN ITS SUPREMEST VIRTUE THE BRILLIANCE OF THE SEAL WOULD ALL APPEAR BUT NATURE GIVES IT EVERMORE DEFICIENT
AND THE GOOD ARE RARE WITH THIS DISTINCTION TAKE THOU WHAT I SAID AND THUS IT CAN CONSIST WITH THY BELIEF OF THE FIRST FATHER AND OF OUR DELIGHT AND LEAD SHALL THIS BE ALWAYS TO THY FEET TO MAKE THEE LIKE A WEARY MAN MOVE SLOWLY
BOTH TO THE YES AND NO THOU SEEST NOT FOR VERY LOW AMONG THE FOOLS IS HE WHO AFFIRMS WITHOUT DISTINCTION OR DENIES AS WELL IN ONE AS IN THE OTHER CASE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS THAT FULL OFTEN BENDS CURRENT OPINION IN THE FALSE DIRECTION
AS FROM WITHOUT TIS STRUCK OR FROM WITHIN INTO MY MIND UPON A SUDDEN DROPPED WHAT I AM SAYING AT THE MOMENT WHEN SILENT BECAME THE GLORIOUS LIFE OF THOMAS BECAUSE OF THE RESEMBLANCE THAT WAS BORN OF HIS DISCOURSE AND THAT OF BEATRICE WHOM AFTER HIM IT PLEASED THUS TO BEGIN
BUT BEATRICE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING APPEARED TO ME THAT WITH THE OTHER SIGHTS THAT FOLLOWED NOT MY MEMORY I MUST LEAVE HER THEN TO UPLIFT THEMSELVES MINE EYES RESUMED THE POWER AND I BEHELD MYSELF TRANSLATED TO HIGHER SALVATION WITH MY LADY ONLY
A WILL BENIGN IN WHICH REVEALS ITSELF EVER THE LOVE THAT RIGHTEOUSLY INSPIRES AS IN THE INIQUITOUS CUPIDITY SILENCE IMPOSED UPON THAT DULCET LYRE AND QUIETED THE CONSECRATED CHORDS
AND SEEMS TO BE A STAR THAT CHANGETH PLACE EXCEPT THAT IN THE PART WHERE IT IS KINDLED NOTHING IS MISSED AND THIS ENDURETH LITTLE SO FROM THE HORN THAT TO THE RIGHT EXTENDS UNTO THAT CROSS'S FOOT THERE RAN A STAR OUT OF THE CONSTELLATION SHINING THERE
SO THAT FIRE SEEMED IT BEHIND ALABASTER THUS PITEOUS DID ANCHISES SHADE REACH FORWARD IF ANY FAITH OUR GREATEST MUSE DESERVE WHEN IN ELYSIUM HE HIS SON PERCEIVED
OF THE SAME WEIGHT FOR EACH OF YOU BECAME FOR IN THE SUN WHICH LIGHTED YOU AND BURNED WITH HEAT AND RADIANCE THEY SO EQUAL ARE THAT ALL SIMILITUDES ARE INSUFFICIENT BUT AMONG MORTALS WILL AND ARGUMENT FOR REASON THAT TO YOU IS MANIFEST
NOT YET THE DAUGHTER AT HER BIRTH STRUCK FEAR INTO THE FATHER FOR THE TIME AND DOWER DID NOT O'ERRUN THIS SIDE OR THAT THE MEASURE NO HOUSES HAD SHE VOID OF FAMILIES NOT YET HAD THITHER COME SARDANAPALUS TO SHOW WHAT IN A CHAMBER CAN BE DONE
AS CINCINNATUS OR CORNELIA NOW TO SUCH A QUIET SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LIFE OF THE CITIZEN TO SUCH A SAFE COMMUNITY AND TO SO SWEET AN INN DID MARY GIVE ME WITH LOUD CRIES INVOKED AND IN YOUR ANCIENT BAPTISTERY AT ONCE CHRISTIAN AND CACCIAGUIDA I BECAME
AND I BEGAN YOU ARE MY ANCESTOR YOU GIVE TO ME ALL HARDIHOOD TO SPEAK YOU LIFT ME SO THAT I AM MORE THAN I SO MANY RIVULETS WITH GLADNESS FILL MY MIND THAT OF ITSELF IT MAKES A JOY BECAUSE IT CAN ENDURE THIS AND NOT BURST
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND THIRTY MORE TO REINFLAME ITSELF BENEATH HIS PAW MY ANCESTORS AND I OUR BIRTHPLACE HAD WHERE FIRST IS FOUND THE LAST WARD OF THE CITY BY HIM WHO RUNNETH IN YOUR ANNUAL GAME SUFFICE IT OF MY ELDERS TO HEAR THIS
SOME WHO TURN FLORENTINES AND TRADE AND DISCOUNT WOULD HAVE GONE BACK AGAIN TO SIMIFONTE THERE WHERE THEIR GRANDSIRES WENT ABOUT AS BEGGARS AT MONTEMURLO STILL WOULD BE THE COUNTS THE CERCHI IN THE PARISH OF ACONE PERHAPS IN VALDIGRIEVE
IN THE LIKE MANNER FORTUNE DOES WITH FLORENCE THEREFORE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A MARVELLOUS THING WHAT I SHALL SAY OF THE GREAT FLORENTINES OF WHOM THE FAME IS HIDDEN IN THE PAST I SAW THE UGHI
EVEN IN THEIR FALL ILLUSTRIOUS CITIZENS AND SAW AS MIGHTY AS THEY ANCIENT WERE WITH HIM OF LA SANNELLA HIM OF ARCA AND SOLDANIER ARDINGHI AND BOSTICHI NEAR TO THE GATE THAT IS AT PRESENT LADEN WITH A NEW FELONY OF SO MUCH WEIGHT
ALREADY RISING WAS BUT FROM LOW PEOPLE SO THAT IT PLEASED NOT UBERTIN DONATO THAT HIS WIFE'S FATHER SHOULD MAKE HIM THEIR KIN ALREADY HAD CAPONSACCO TO THE MARKET FROM FESOLE DESCENDED AND ALREADY GIUDA AND INFANGATO WERE GOOD BURGHERS
BUT NOW THAT SHE TASTED THE SWEETS OF POWER SHE WAS NOT DISPOSED TO ALLOW JULIUS TO TREAT HER AS HE CHOSE MISSUS GILROY CAME BACK FROM HER VISIT TO THE LAWYER
KNOWING THAT SHE HAD MARRIED WALTER GORE AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A FLAW IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES UPON WHICH SHE BUILT HER CLAIM YET SHE TRUSTED TO HER OWN CLEVERNESS TO CONCEAL THIS FROM THE TOO CLEVER LAWYER BUT APART FROM THIS
SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN MEEKER AND ALTHOUGH MISS RANDOLPH DID NOT LIKE OR TRUST THE WOMAN SHE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH HER IN ANY WAY LUCY SUFFERED SEVERELY FROM THE SHOCK OF SIR SIMON'S TRAGIC DEATH
AND I WILL GIVE YOU A TONIC NATURALLY YOU SUFFER FROM THE TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SIR SIMON'S DEATH HE THOUGHT A MOMENT
PROBABLY BUT SHE BEARS UP WONDERFULLY BUT THAT SHE IS IN MOURNING ONE WOULD HARDLY GUESS SHE HAD SUSTAINED SUCH A LOSS WAS SHE VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MISTER GORE YES
RISING TO TAKE HIS LEAVE IF HE WAS GUILTY AH SAID LUCY RAISING HERSELF WITH ANIMATION FROM THE SOFA UPON WHICH SHE WAS LYING IF HE WAS GUILTY
POOR BERNARD'S DEATH HAS SHAKEN ME IT IS JUST AS WELL HE DID DIE THOUGH I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT SAID PAYNE BUT I MUST TAKE MY LEAVE I WILL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN MISS RANDOLPH AND REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU
SIR SIMON IS NOT YOUR UNCLE SAID BERYL JEALOUSLY YOU ARE ONLY A DISTANT RELATIVE PERHAPS MY MARRIAGE WITH YOU MAY MAKE ME A NEARER ONE
IF WE EVER DO MARRY SAID JULIUS GLOOMILY SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I SHOULD LIKE TO BREAK THE ENGAGEMENT JULIUS WE WERE NEVER SUITED TO ONE ANOTHER BERYL'S VANITY WAS HURT
NO BERNARD AND I ARE LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER BUT HE IS DEAD
HE MUST KNOW THAT BERNARD IS DEAD SEEING THAT THE COAT AND HAT WERE FOUND ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER NO MAN COULD HAVE LIVED IN THE COLD AND THE FOG YET IF DURHAM WAS SURE HE WOULD NOT HOLD THE ESTATE AGAINST BERNARD'S COMING
THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT HE MAY HAVE ESCAPED I SINCERELY TRUST NOT AH YOU ALWAYS HATED BERNARD ON THE CONTRARY I SPEAK FOR HIS GOOD
I AM NOT HARD HEARTED SNAPPED BERYL I ALWAYS DO GOOD
THIS BOY IS A GRANDSON OF LORD CONNISTON'S HOUSEKEEPER MISSUS MOON AT COVE CASTLE SAID LUCY WITH SOME COLOR IN HER FACE I KNOW DO YOU KNOW LORD CONNISTON ASKED JULIUS SUSPICIOUSLY I HAVE MET HIM ONCE
LUCY IF YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT BEGAN BERYL AND THEN RESTRAINED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT IT IS NO USE OUR QUARRELLING LET ME SHOW YOU THAT I AM NOT SO CARELESS OF OTHERS OR SO HARD HEARTED AS I SEEM TO BE
LUCY IF YOU CAN FIND OUT FROM LORD CONNISTON OR DURHAM THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE LET ME KNOW AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP HIM HOW CAN YOU HELP HIM WHEN YOU BELIEVE HIM GUILTY I MIGHT HELP HIM TO ESCAPE
AND OF ALL THE PROPERTY AND OF THE TITLE ALSO
I WILL NO LONGER BE BOUND TO YOU I NEVER LOVED YOU BUT I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO SEE THE BEST SIDE OF YOU BUT YOU HAVE NO GOOD SIDE YOU ARE A MEAN COWARDLY SERPENT AND IF BERNARD IS ALIVE I SHALL DO MY BEST TO DEFEND HIM
JULIUS IN ORDER THAT THE LAD MIGHT MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON MISS PLANTAGENET HAD DRESSED HIM IN A NEW SUIT AND PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR MUCH OF THE BOY REMAINED IN THIS PRECOCIOUS CRIMINAL YOUNG JERRY TROTTED ALONG SMILING
AND DULL SAID JERRY PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LORD WHAT A BORE STOPPING WITH HER WILL BE BUT I CAN NIP OVER AND SEE VICTORIA WHEN I LIKE AND KEEP AN EYE ON LORD CONNISTON AS I TOLD YOU
ON DURHAM AND ON ALICE MALLESON FOR THIS LAST REASON HE WAS INTRODUCING HIM INTO THE HOUSE IF BERNARD WERE ALIVE AS JULIUS BEGAN TO SUSPECT HE WOULD COME TO ONE OF THESE THREE PEOPLE AND THEN JERRY WOULD AT ONCE BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT
AND BUT FOR THE SAKE OF ALICE SHE WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO LET HIM ENTER THE BOWER AS IT WAS AND WITH GREAT DIPLOMACY SO GREAT THAT IT DECEIVED EVEN THE ASTUTE BERYL SHE ASKED HIM TO COME INTO THE HOUSE
HE IS A LAD I WISH YOU TO HELP SAID BERYL BLANDLY LAST TIME WE MET MISS PLANTAGENET YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANTED A PAGE NOT EXACTLY A PAGE SAID THE OLD DAME RUBBING HER NOSE
A SURE SIGN SHE WAS PERPLEXED MERELY A BOY TO SEE AFTER THE FOWLS AND TO WAIT ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN NECESSARY I LOVE FOWLS SAID JERRY SWEETLY AND LOOKING AS INNOCENT AS A BABE AND DOGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
YOU SEEM A NICE LAD WHO IS HE MISTER BERYL A POOR BOY WHO SOLD MATCHES IN LONDON BUT I DIDN'T ALWAYS PIPED JERRY SHIFTING FROM ONE LEG TO THE OTHER IN FEIGNED EMBARRASSMENT AND PLAYING HIS PART PERFECTLY
I LIVED WITH GRANDMOTHER AT COVE CASTLE THAT'S LORD CONNISTON'S PLACE SAID MISS BERENGARIA MORE PERPLEXED THAN EVER WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE I LIVED WITH GRANDMOTHER MY NAME IS JERRY MOON
I SAW HIS LORDSHIP DRESSED AS A SOLDIER HE SNUFFLED AND I TOLD MISTER BERYL HIS LORDSHIP WAS SO ANGRY THAT HE GOT ME TURNED OFF SAYING I WAS UNGRATEFUL
JERRY GRINNED AND DUCKED TOWARDS THE DOOR GOOD BYE JERRY SAID BERYL KINDLY DON'T FORGET ME IF I DO MAY I BE OH NO KIND LADY I MEAN MA'AM I WON'T SWEAR
AS OURS IS TO US AS YOU HAVE READ ON AN EARLIER PAGE WHEN ABE GREW TO BE A BIG STRONG BOY HE SAVED A DRUNKEN MAN FROM FREEZING IN THE MUD BY CARRYING HIM TO A CABIN
THIS IS THE ONE HUNDRED AND TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF WASHINGTON WE ARE MET TO CELEBRATE THIS DAY WASHINGTON IS THE MIGHTIEST NAME OF EARTH LONG SINCE THE MIGHTIEST IN THE CAUSE OF CIVIL LIBERTY
IT WOULD BE LIKE THE POPE'S BULL OR DECREE AGAINST THE COMET A DELEGATION OF CHICAGO MINISTERS CAME TO BEG MISTER LINCOLN TO FREE THE SLAVES HE PATIENTLY EXPLAINED TO THEM
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S RATHER ODD THAT HE SHOULD SEND SUCH A MESSAGE BY WAY OF THAT AWFUL WICKED CITY OF CHICAGO THE MINISTERS WERE SHOCKED AT SUCH AN ANSWER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
THE PRESIDENT HAD NOT HELD A MEETING OF HIS CABINET FOR SOME TIME HE THOUGHT OF THE OCCASION WHEN AS A YOUNG MAN HE WENT ON A FLATBOAT TRIP TO NEW ORLEANS AND SAW
WHICH WAS TO TAKE EFFECT THE FIRST OF JANUARY FOLLOWING SECRETARY STANTON CONTINUED I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE CALM BUT I THINK I LOST MY CALMNESS FOR A MOMENT AND WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM I AROSE
APPROACHED THE PRESIDENT EXTENDED MY HAND AND SAID MISTER PRESIDENT IF THE READING OF CHAPTERS OF ARTEMUS WARD IS A PRELUDE TO SUCH A DEED AS THIS THE BOOK SHOULD BE FILED AMONG THE ARCHIVES OF THE NATION
AND THE AUTHOR SHOULD BE CANONIZED HENCEFORTH I SEE THE LIGHT AND THE COUNTRY IS SAVED AND ALL SAID AMEN AND LINCOLN SAID TO ME IN A DROLL WAY JUST AS I WAS LEAVING
MISTER LINCOLN SEATED HIMSELF AT HIS TABLE TOOK UP THE PEN DIPPED IT IN THE INK HELD THE PEN A MOMENT THEN LAID IT DOWN AFTER WAITING A WHILE HE WENT THROUGH THE SAME MOVEMENTS AS BEFORE
ACCOUNTED VICTORY ENOUGH FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ISSUE HIS EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION PROVED TO BE A DRAWN BATTLE WITH TERRIFIC LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES LEE WAS DRIVEN BACK FROM MARYLAND THEN IT IS TRUE
BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE GUNBOAT AT CAIRO ILLINOIS WITH THE GLAD TIDINGS FROM VICKSBURG WHICH ADDED NEW LUSTER TO THE PATRIOTIC JOY OF INDEPENDENCE DAY THE TELEGRAPH WIRES
HE REACHED OUT TOOK HER UP AND KISSED HER SAYING YOU'RE A SWEET LITTLE ROSEBUD YOURSELF I HOPE YOUR LIFE WILL OPEN INTO PERPETUAL BEAUTY AND GOODNESS
WREATHED WITH SMILES AND A CHUCKLING IN HIS THROAT OF PAPA DAY MY PAPA DAY NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE BOY MEANT BY PAPA DAY IT WAS HIS PET NAME FOR THE DEAREST MAN ON EARTH
AND THE COUNTRY ANY GOOD BUT IT HURT HIM DEEP IN HIS HEART TO KNOW THAT SOME OF HIS BELOVED CHILDREN MISUNDERSTOOD HIM SO THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO KILL HIM IT WAS NO ONE'S BULLET WHICH MADE ABRAHAM LINCOLN A MARTYR
AND WILL BE DULY PROMULGATED GIVE US DIXIE BOYS THEN HE WENT ON OUTLINING A POLICY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TOWARD THE SOUTH SHOWING A SPIRIT FAR HIGHER
BUT STILL HE ANSWERED NOT A WORD THE SEPARATION OF THE TWO BOYS AT A LATE HOUR GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT THAT SAME WEEK LITTLE TAD CAME IN ALONE AT A BASEMENT DOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE FROM THE NATIONAL THEATER
HIS SENSE OF LONELINESS PENETRATED HIS DREAMS SOMETIMES HE WOULD CHUCKLE AND GURGLE IN AN ECSTACY AS HE HAD DONE WHEN RIDING ON HIS FATHER'S BACK ROMPING THROUGH THE STATELY ROOMS
FOR THIS AS FOR ALL THE INEQUITIES THE GREAT HEART OF THE WHITE HOUSE WAS PREPARED HIS SPIRIT HAD SHONE THROUGH HIS WHOLE LIFE AS IF IN LETTERS OF LIVING FIRE WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE WITH CHARITY FOR ALL
MEN WERE OFFERING EGGS AND CHICKENS AND FRUIT FOR SALE UPON THE STREET AND BREAD AS I LIVE BREAD IN SMALL ROUND LOAVES OR BUNS I RODE ON INTO THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE A TOILING POPULATION WAS IN EVIDENCE
THE HOUSES AND WALLS WERE STRONG AND SUBSTANTIAL STONE AND BRICK REPLACED THE MUD WALLS OF THE KOREAN DWELLINGS TWILIGHT FELL AND DEEPENED AND STILL THE PLOUGHS WENT UP AND DOWN THE FIELDS THE SOWERS FOLLOWING AFTER
AND HERE THE TANNERS WERE AT WORK MAKING LEATHER I BOUGHT A MEASURE OF CORN FROM MINE HOST FOR MY HORSES AND HE OVERCHARGED ME THIRTY CENTS I WAS IN CHINA ANTUNG WAS JAMMED WITH JAPANESE TROOPS
HE DID THIS NOT FROM A SENSE OF PATRIOTISM BUT FOR THE INVADING FOREIGN DEVILS BECAUSE THEY PAID HIM A DAILY WAGE OF FIFTY CENTS HE IS NOT FRIGHTENED BY WAR HE ACCEPTS IT AS HE DOES RAIN AND SUNSHINE THE CHANGING OF THE SEASONS AND OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA
NOR IS THE CHINESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE WHICH HE HAS BEEN SO OFTEN DESIGNATED HE IS NOT SO ILL DISPOSED TOWARD NEW IDEAS AND NEW METHODS AS HIS HISTORY WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE TRUE
TRULY WOULD HE OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE THE MUCH HERALDED YELLOW PERIL WERE IT NOT FOR HIS PRESENT MANAGEMENT THIS MANAGEMENT HIS GOVERNMENT IS SET CRYSTALLIZED IT IS WHAT BINDS HIM DOWN TO BUILDING AS HIS FATHERS BUILT
THE GOVERNING CLASS ENTRENCHED BY THE PRECEDENT AND POWER OF CENTURIES AND BY THE STAMP IT HAS PUT UPON HIS MIND WILL NEVER FREE HIM IT WOULD BE THE SUICIDE OF THE GOVERNING CLASS AND THE GOVERNING CLASS KNOWS IT
THE JAPANESE IS PREPARED AND FIT TO UNDERTAKE THIS MANAGEMENT NOT ONLY HAS HE PROVED HIMSELF AN APT IMITATOR OF WESTERN MATERIAL PROGRESS A STURDY WORKER AND A CAPABLE ORGANIZER BUT HE IS FAR MORE FIT TO MANAGE THE CHINESE THAN ARE WE
WE HAVE HAD AFRICA FOR THE AFRIKANDER AND AT NO DISTANT DAY WE SHALL HEAR ASIA FOR THE ASIATIC FOUR HUNDRED MILLION INDEFATIGABLE WORKERS DEFT INTELLIGENT AND UNAFRAID TO DIE AROUSED AND REJUVENESCENT
IT REQUIRED NO REVOLUTION OF HIS NATURE TO LEARN TO CALCULATE THE RANGE AND FIRE A FIELD GUN OR TO MARCH THE GOOSE STEP IT WAS A MERE MATTER OF TRAINING OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF OUR INTELLECT
IT IS THE SACRED ABODE OF THE GODS THE SPIRIT OF OUR FOREFATHERS TO US THE EMPEROR IS MORE THAN THE ARCH CONSTABLE OF A REICHSSTAAT OR EVEN THE PATRON OF A KULTURSTAAT HE IS THE BODILY REPRESENTATIVE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH
WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR OUR CHILDREN'S TIME NOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WE SHALL OURSELVES SEE AND LARGELY DETERMINE THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN FENG WANG CHENG MANCHURIA
THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT ME INTO THE PAINFUL POSITION OF HAVING TO REFUSE YOU HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND WALKED WITH OFFENDED DIGNITY OUT OF THE SURGERY THE STUDENT SMILED BITTERLY AND TURNED TO HIS WORK OF MAKING UP THE MORNING PRESCRIPTIONS
BUT AFTER A TIME HE HAD GROWN CALLOUS TO IT AND ACCEPTED IT AS IT WAS MEANT BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT WAS INSOLENCE BRUTAL OVERBEARING INSOLENCE WITH PHYSICAL MENACE BEHIND IT WHAT NAME HE ASKED COLDLY
THE BLOWS WERE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS A SAVAGE SWING WHICH WHISTLED PAST MONTGOMERY'S EAR AND A STRAIGHT DRIVE WHICH TOOK THE WORKMAN ON THE CHIN LUCK WAS WITH THE ASSISTANT THAT SINGLE WHIZZING UPPERCUT AND THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS DELIVERED
LOOSENED HIS COLLAR AND SQUEEZED THE SURGERY SPONGE OVER HIS FACE HE SAT UP AT LAST WITH A GASP AND A SCOWL DOMN THEE THOU'S SPOILT MY NECK TIE SAID HE MOPPING UP THE WATER FROM HIS BREAST
YET ALL DAY HE WAS AWARE OF A SENSE OF VAGUE UNEASINESS WHICH SHARPENED INTO DISMAY WHEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HE WAS INFORMED THAT THREE GENTLEMEN HAD CALLED AND WERE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE SURGERY A CORONER'S INQUEST
ABOVE ALL WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT FROM HIM WAS A MOST INEXPLICABLE PROBLEM THE FIRST WAS SORLEY WILSON THE SON OF THE OWNER OF THE NONPAREIL COALPIT HE WAS A YOUNG BLOOD OF TWENTY HEIR TO A FORTUNE A KEEN SPORTSMAN
NO IT'S OFF IT'S NOWT STAND OOP LAD LET'S SEE THEE STANDIN IT WAS THE PUBLICAN WHO SPOKE MONTGOMERY OBEYED HE WOULD LEARN ALL ABOUT IT NO DOUBT IF HE WERE PATIENT
IF YOU CAN LICK TED BARTON YOU MAY LICK THE MASTER OF CROXLEY BUT IF YOU DON'T WE'RE DONE FOR THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WHO IS IN THE SAME STREET WITH HIM IN THIS DISTRICT IT'S TWENTY ROUNDS TWO OUNCE GLOVES QUEENSBERRY RULES AND A DECISION ON POINTS IF YOU FIGHT TO THE FINISH
OR ANY OTHER SHAPE WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST ITSELF TO YOU YOU SEE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR HAVING LOST OUR CHAMPION SO WE REALLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE A CLAIM UPON YOU GIVE ME A MOMENT GENTLEMEN IT IS VERY UNEXPECTED
THOU'LL RISE IN ONE DAY FROM BEING JUST A COMMON DOCTOR TO THE BEST KNOWN MON TWIXT HERE AND BRADFORD THOU ART A WITHERIN TYKE THOU ART AND NO MISTAKE AND IF THOU BEAT THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL THE BEER THOU WANT FOR THE REST OF THY LIFE WAITING FOR THEE AT THE FOUR SACKS
THEN YOU'LL WANT A SPARRING PARTNER OGILVY HAS BEEN ACTING FOR BARTON BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT HE IS CLASS ENOUGH BARTON BEARS YOU NO GRUDGE HE'S A GOOD HEARTED FELLOW THOUGH CROSS GRAINED WITH STRANGERS HE LOOKED UPON YOU AS A STRANGER THIS MORNING BUT HE SAYS HE KNOWS YOU NOW
IT WAS TRUE THAT HIS TEACHER WAS LONG PAST HIS PRIME SLOW UPON HIS FEET AND STIFF IN HIS JOINTS BUT EVEN SO HE WAS STILL A TOUGH ANTAGONIST BUT MONTGOMERY HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT HE COULD MORE THAN HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIM HE HAD WON THE UNIVERSITY MEDAL AND HIS TEACHER
IN WHICH HE HAD THE WORST OF IT BUT HAD MADE THE PRIZE FIGHTER STRETCH HIMSELF TO THE UTTERMOST THERE WAS HIS WHOLE RECORD AND WAS IT ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO STAND UP TO THE MASTER OF CROXLEY HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE MASTER BEFORE
COMPOUND FOR SINS WE'RE MOST INCLINED TO BY DAMNING THOSE WE HAVE NO MIND TO IN ANY CASE MONTGOMERY FELT THAT OF ALL THE MEN CONCERNED IN SUCH A FIGHT PROMOTERS BACKERS SPECTATORS IT IS THE ACTUAL FIGHTER
BROKE HIS LEG HAS HE YES AND IT SET BADLY THEY CA HIM OWD K BEHIND HIS BACK FOR THAT IS HOW HIS TWO LEGS LOOK BUT HIS ARMS WELL IF THEY WAS BOTH STROPPED TO A BENCH AS THE SAYIN IS
BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN SAID THE PROVINCIAL BIOGRAPHER SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN IN SPORTING CIRCLES AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY IS NOW IN HIS FORTIETH YEAR HANG IT I'M ONLY TWENTY THREE
IT WAS OWING TO THIS THAT HE WAS DEFEATED IN SEVEN ROUNDS BY WILLOX THE MAN WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEATEN AND AFTERWARDS BY JAMES SHAW OF LONDON THOUGH THE LATTER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD FOUND THE TOUGHEST CUSTOMER OF HIS CAREER UNDISMAYED BY HIS REVERSES
MEANWHILE IF HIS OPPONENT WERE THE BEST MAN WHO EVER JUMPED THE ROPES INTO A RING HIS OWN DUTY WAS CLEAR HE MUST PREPARE HIMSELF CAREFULLY THROW AWAY NO CHANCE AND DO THE VERY BEST THAT HE COULD BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE WHICH EXISTS IN BOXING AS IN EVERY SPORT
BETWEEN THE AMATEUR AND THE PROFESSIONAL THE COOLNESS THE POWER OF HITTING ABOVE ALL THE CAPABILITY OF TAKING PUNISHMENT COUNT FOR SO MUCH THOSE SPECIALLY DEVELOPED GUTTA PERCHA LIKE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES OF THE HARDENED PUGILIST
GAINING AS MUCH PROFIT AS COULD BE GOT FROM A RUSHING TWO HANDED SLOGGER BARTON WAS FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR HIS CLEVERNESS AND QUICKNESS BUT DOUBTFUL ABOUT HIS STRENGTH HARD HITTING WAS THE FEATURE OF HIS OWN STYLE AND HE EXACTED IT FROM OTHERS
HE'S SIMPLY RIPPING SAID THE UNDERGRADUATE
THAT'S ONLY THREE PUND OFF IN A WEEK'S TRAININ SAID THE HORSE BREAKER HE SAID RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS IN CONDITION WELL IT'S FINE STUFF ALL THERE IS OF IT BUT I'M NONE SO SURE AS THERE IS ENOUGH
HOW CAME YOU TO KNOW SO MUCH WHO ARE YOU I'M HIS SON SIR WILSON WHISTLED AND WHO SENT YOU TO US MY MOTHER I MAUN GET BACK TO HER AGAIN TAKE THIS HALF CROWN NO SIR I DON'T SEEK MONEY IN COMIN HERE
THE NEXT DAY THE WEATHER WAS SPLENDID THE SKY AND THE SEA HAD SUNK INTO SUDDEN REPOSE EVERY TRACE OF THE AWFUL STORM HAD DISAPPEARED
ON MY ARRIVAL ON THE SHORE I FOUND HANS SURROUNDED BY AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ARTICLES ALL ARRANGED IN GOOD ORDER MY UNCLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WITH A LIVELY GRATITUDE THIS MAN WITH ALMOST SUPERHUMAN DEVOTION
FOUR MONTHS CRIED THE PROFESSOR WE HAVE TIME TO GO AND TO RETURN
LET IT BE AXEL ISLAND THEN WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LEAGUES OF SEA AND WE WERE SIX HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM ICELAND VERY WELL ANSWERED MY UNCLE LET US START FROM THAT POINT AND COUNT FOUR DAYS STORM
WELL REPLIED MY UNCLE WE MAY EASILY ASCERTAIN THIS BY CONSULTING THE COMPASS LET US GO AND SEE WHAT IT SAYS THE PROFESSOR MOVED TOWARDS THE ROCK UPON WHICH HANS HAD LAID DOWN THE INSTRUMENTS
AND QUESTIONED THE NEEDLE WHICH AFTER A FEW OSCILLATIONS PRESENTLY ASSUMED A FIXED POSITION MY UNCLE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AGAIN HE RUBBED HIS EYES
WE HAD GONE BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS BUT MY UNCLE RAPIDLY RECOVERED HIMSELF AHA WILL FATE PLAY TRICKS UPON ME WILL THE ELEMENTS LAY PLOTS AGAINST ME
SHALL FIRE AIR AND WATER MAKE A COMBINED ATTACK AGAINST ME WELL THEY SHALL KNOW WHAT A DETERMINED MAN CAN DO I WILL NOT YIELD I WILL NOT STIR A SINGLE FOOT BACKWARDS AND IT WILL BE SEEN WHETHER MAN OR NATURE IS TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND
JUST LISTEN TO ME I SAID FIRMLY AMBITION MUST HAVE A LIMIT SOMEWHERE WE CANNOT PERFORM IMPOSSIBILITIES WE ARE NOT AT ALL FIT FOR ANOTHER SEA VOYAGE WHO WOULD DREAM OF UNDERTAKING A VOYAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES UPON A HEAP OF ROTTEN PLANKS
TO THE RAFT HE SHOUTED SUCH WAS HIS ONLY REPLY IT WAS NO USE FOR ME TO ENTREAT SUPPLICATE GET ANGRY OR DO ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WAY OF OPPOSITION
THE ICELANDER SEEMED TO HAVE RENOUNCED ALL WILL OF HIS OWN AND MADE A VOW TO FORGET AND DENY HIMSELF I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF A SERVANT SO FEUDALISED AS IT WERE TO HIS MASTER MY ONLY COURSE WAS TO PROCEED
I WAS THEREFORE GOING WITH AS MUCH RESIGNATION AS I COULD FIND TO RESUME MY ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON THE RAFT WHEN MY UNCLE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WE SHALL NOT SAIL UNTIL TO MORROW HE SAID
I ALSO SAW IMMENSE CARAPACES MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER
THIS LIQUID MASS WOULD BE LOST BY DEGREES FARTHER AND FARTHER WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH AND IT CERTAINLY HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE WATERS OF THE OCEAN OVERHEAD WHICH HAD MADE THEIR WAY HITHER THROUGH SOME FISSURE YET
IT MUST BE BELIEVED THAT THAT FISSURE IS NOW CLOSED AND THAT ALL THIS CAVERN OR IMMENSE RESERVOIR WAS FILLED IN A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS EVEN THIS WATER SUBJECTED TO THE FIERCE ACTION OF CENTRAL HEAT HAD PARTLY BEEN RESOLVED INTO VAPOUR
AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ELECTRICITY WHICH RAISED SUCH TEMPESTS WITHIN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH THIS THEORY OF THE PHENOMENA WE HAD WITNESSED SEEMED SATISFACTORY TO ME FOR HOWEVER GREAT AND STUPENDOUS THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE
FIXED PHYSICAL LAWS WILL OR MAY ALWAYS EXPLAIN THEM WE WERE THEREFORE WALKING UPON SEDIMENTARY SOIL THE DEPOSITS OF THE WATERS OF FORMER AGES THE PROFESSOR WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINING EVERY LITTLE FISSURE IN THE ROCKS
BUT MORE WAS TO COME WHEN
NEAR ABBEVILLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOMME FOUND A HUMAN JAWBONE FOURTEEN FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE IT WAS THE FIRST FOSSIL OF THIS NATURE THAT HAD EVER BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT NOT FAR DISTANT
AND AGREEING IN THAT WITH CUVIER HE REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT THE HUMAN SPECIES COULD BE CONTEMPORARY WITH THE ANIMALS OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD MY UNCLE LIEDENBROCK ALONG WITH THE GREAT BODY OF THE GEOLOGISTS HAD MAINTAINED HIS GROUND DISPUTED AND ARGUED UNTIL
OF CERTAIN GROTTOES IN FRANCE SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM AS WELL AS WEAPONS TOOLS EARTHEN UTENSILS BONES OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS THE EXISTENCE THEREFORE OF MAN IN THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BECOME DAILY MORE CERTAIN
NOR WAS THIS ALL FRESH DISCOVERIES OF REMAINS IN THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION HAD EMBOLDENED OTHER GEOLOGISTS TO REFER BACK THE HUMAN SPECIES TO A HIGHER ANTIQUITY STILL IT IS TRUE THAT THESE REMAINS WERE NOT HUMAN BONES
OTTO LIEDENBROCK YIELDING TO HIS NATURE FORGOT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EVENTFUL JOURNEY FORGOT WHERE WE WERE STANDING FORGOT THE VAULTED CAVERN WHICH CONTAINED US NO DOUBT HE WAS IN MIND BACK AGAIN IN HIS JOHANNAEUM
HE COULD GET NO FURTHER
IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE THE UNLUCKY WORD WOULD NOT COME OUT AT THE JOHANNAEUM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LAUGH GIGANTOSTEOLOGIE AT LAST THE PROFESSOR BURST OUT BETWEEN TWO WORDS WHICH I SHALL NOT RECORD HERE
HAVE RECOGNISED IN THESE BONES NOTHING MORE REMARKABLE THAN THE BONES OF THE MAMMOTH AND OTHER MAMMALS OF THE POST TERTIARY PERIOD BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SPECIMEN TO DOUBT WOULD BE TO INSULT SCIENCE THERE STANDS THE BODY YOU MAY SEE IT TOUCH IT
YOU SEE HE SAID THAT IT IS NOT SIX FEET LONG AND THAT WE ARE STILL SEPARATED BY A LONG INTERVAL FROM THE PRETENDED RACE OF GIANTS
IT IS EVIDENTLY CAUCASIAN IT IS THE WHITE RACE OUR OWN THE SKULL OF THIS FOSSIL IS A REGULAR OVAL OR RATHER OVOID IT EXHIBITS NO PROMINENT CHEEKBONES NO PROJECTING JAWS
HOW THOSE STRATA ON WHICH HE LAY SLIPPED DOWN INTO THIS ENORMOUS HOLLOW IN THE GLOBE I CONFESS I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION
IT WAS OF CEDAR CURIOUSLY INLAID WITH SOME DARKER WOOD AND RAISED ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND ON A CARVED STAND OF THE SAME THE LOCK WAS SILVER THOUGH TARNISHED FROM AGE
BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER STARTING QUIT HER HOLD AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE THIS ILL TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF USE TO MISS MORLAND AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER
ENTERED THE ROOM AND TO THE RISING SHAME OF HAVING HARBOURED FOR SOME MINUTES AN ABSURD EXPECTATION WAS THEN ADDED THE SHAME OF BEING CAUGHT IN SO IDLE A SEARCH
AND MOST HEARTILY DID SHE REJOICE IN THE HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER ENTRANCE WITHIN WALLS SO SOLEMN SHE HAD NOTHING TO DREAD FROM MIDNIGHT ASSASSINS OR DRUNKEN GALLANTS
SHE WAS ENABLED ESPECIALLY ON PERCEIVING THAT MISS TILNEY SLEPT ONLY TWO DOORS FROM HER TO ENTER HER ROOM WITH A TOLERABLY STOUT HEART AND HER SPIRITS WERE IMMEDIATELY ASSISTED BY THE CHEERFUL BLAZE OF A WOOD FIRE
IMMEDIATELY RUSHED ACROSS HER AND THOUGH THERE COULD BE NOTHING REALLY IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHIMSICAL IT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE SHE TOOK HER CANDLE AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE CABINET IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY EBONY AND GOLD
ALARMED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY A BOLT FLEW AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SUCCESSFUL BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER
TO RETIRE TO BED HOWEVER UNSATISFIED ON SUCH A POINT WOULD BE VAIN SINCE SLEEP MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CABINET SO MYSTERIOUSLY CLOSED IN HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY AGAIN THEREFORE SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO THE KEY
SHE SEIZED WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND THE PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPT
AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH AWFUL SENSATIONS THIS STRIKING EXEMPLIFICATION OF WHAT HENRY HAD FORETOLD RESOLVED INSTANTLY TO PERUSE EVERY LINE BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTED TO REST THE DIMNESS OF THE LIGHT HER CANDLE EMITTED MADE HER TURN TO IT WITH ALARM
TO CLOSE HER EYES IN SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE FELT MUST BE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH A CURIOSITY SO JUSTLY AWAKENED AND FEELINGS IN EVERY WAY SO AGITATED REPOSE MUST BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE THE STORM TOO ABROAD SO DREADFUL
INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW
AND HOW MIGHT YOU LEARN BY ACCIDENT OR ARGUMENT
BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY SUCH PURSUIT TO GET ME OUT OF DOORS THE PLEASURE OF WALKING AND BREATHING FRESH AIR IS ENOUGH FOR ME
MAMMA SAYS I AM NEVER WITHIN
THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
HAS HIS PROFESSION THE IMPOSING EFFECT OF THIS LAST ARGUMENT WAS EQUAL TO HIS WISHES THE SILENCE OF THE LADY PROVED IT TO BE UNANSWERABLE SOMETHING HAD BEEN SAID THE EVENING BEFORE OF HER BEING SHOWN OVER THE HOUSE AND HE NOW OFFERED HIMSELF AS HER CONDUCTOR
HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY AND WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CATHERINE WITH A DISAPPOINTED ANXIOUS FACE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN INCLINATION UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER
IF HENRY HAD BEEN WITH THEM INDEED BUT NOW SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHEN SHE SAW IT SUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF AND PUT ON HER BONNET IN PATIENT DISCONTENT SHE WAS STRUCK HOWEVER BEYOND HER EXPECTATION BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE ABBEY
AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN THE WHOLE BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE RICH IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION THE REMAINDER WAS SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS
AS HE SOON FORCED HER TO TELL HIM IN WORDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY GARDENS AT ALL EQUAL TO THEM BEFORE
WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF THAT SORT HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT HE DID BELIEVE THEM TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM IF HE HAD A HOBBY HORSE IT WAS THAT HE LOVED A GARDEN THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING HE LOVED GOOD FRUIT
HE IS A HAPPY MAN SAID THE GENERAL WITH A LOOK OF VERY HAPPY CONTEMPT HAVING TAKEN HER INTO EVERY DIVISION AND LED HER UNDER EVERY WALL TILL SHE WAS HEARTILY WEARY OF SEEING AND WONDERING
BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING ELEANOR WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THAT COLD DAMP PATH TO IT MISS MORLAND WILL GET WET OUR BEST WAY IS ACROSS THE PARK
A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PRESENT A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT FRIEND
WAS SHE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN WAS SHE HANDSOME WAS THERE ANY PICTURE OF HER IN THE ABBEY
HER PICTURE I SUPPOSE BLUSHING AT THE CONSUMMATE ART OF HER OWN QUESTION HANGS IN YOUR FATHER'S ROOM NO IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE DRAWING ROOM BUT MY FATHER WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE PAINTING AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAD NO PLACE
IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXCITED AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE WAS NOW ABSOLUTE AVERSION YES AVERSION HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM ODIOUS TO HER
AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN OBLIGED TO WALK WITH HIM LISTEN TO HIM AND EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE SMILED BEING NO LONGER ABLE HOWEVER TO RECEIVE PLEASURE FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS SHE SOON BEGAN TO WALK WITH LASSITUDE
THE GENERAL PERCEIVED IT AND WITH A CONCERN FOR HER HEALTH WHICH SEEMED TO REPROACH HER FOR HER OPINION OF HIM WAS MOST URGENT FOR RETURNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HOUSE HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
BUT THIS WORK HAS NOT UP TO THE PRESENT TIME BEEN UNDERTAKEN THE ANTIQUITY INTO WHICH THE DREAM WORK CARRIES US BACK IS OF A DOUBLE ASPECT FIRSTLY THE INDIVIDUAL ANTIQUITY CHILDHOOD AND SECONDLY IN SO FAR AS EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN HIS CHILDHOOD
THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE WHICH PART OF THE LATENT PSYCHIC PROCEEDING HAS ITS SOURCE IN THE INDIVIDUAL
THEY DO NOT BESPEAK NECESSARILY IMPORTANT EXPERIENCES OF CHILDHOOD NOT EVEN SUCH AS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CHILD NEED APPEAR OF IMPORTANCE THEY ARE OFTEN SO BANAL AND INTRINSICALLY SO MEANINGLESS THAT WE ASK OURSELVES IN WONDER WHY JUST THESE DETAILS
HAVE ESCAPED BEING FORGOTTEN I ONCE ENDEAVORED TO APPROACH THE RIDDLE OF CHILDHOOD AMNESIA AND THE INTERRUPTED MEMORY REMNANTS WITH THE HELP OF ANALYSIS AND I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT IN THE CASE OF THE CHILD TOO
AND IN SO FAR AS THE CURE IS TO ANY DEGREE SUCCESSFUL WE ARE ABLE AGAIN TO BRING TO LIGHT THE CONTENT OF THE CHILDHOOD YEARS THUS CLOUDED IN FORGETFULNESS THESE IMPRESSIONS HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN FORGOTTEN THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN INACCESSIBLE LATENT
NOT UNTIL LATER DOES THE LOVE IMPULSE BECOME INDEPENDENT OF EGOISM IN BRIEF EGOISM HAS TAUGHT THE CHILD TO LOVE IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS INSTRUCTIVE TO COMPARE THE CHILD'S REGARD
TO FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN A NEW LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER ARRIVES THE LATTER IS USUALLY RECEIVED IN A FAR FROM FRIENDLY MANNER EXPRESSIONS SUCH AS I DON'T WANT HIM LET THE STORK TAKE HIM AWAY AGAIN ARE VERY USUAL
AND RIVALRY AMONG THEM BUT HOW MAY FEELINGS OF HATRED FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DAUGHTER AND MOTHER PARENTS AND CHILDREN THIS RELATIONSHIP IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE MORE FAVORABLE EVEN WHEN LOOKED AT FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CHILD
WHICH IN THE OTHER CASE WE PERMITTED TO REMAIN PROFANE
I DO NOT WISH TO MAINTAIN THAT THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX COVERS ENTIRELY THE RELATION OF THE CHILD TO ITS PARENTS THIS RELATION CAN BE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED FURTHERMORE THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX IS MORE OR LESS WELL DEVELOPED IT MAY EVEN EXPERIENCE A REVERSAL
WHO WERE SO FORTUNATE AS TO ESCAPE IN LATER LIFE THESE CONFLICTS WITH THEIR PARENTS AND INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED THEREWITH WE FIND WHAT WE CALL THE CASTRATION COMPLEX THE REACTION TO SEXUAL INTIMIDATION OR RESTRICTION ASCRIBED TO THE FATHER
BEING INSENSIBLE TO THE CONVENTIONAL FEELING OF DISGUST THIRD THE INCEST LIMITATION BEING PROHIBITED FROM SEEKING SEXUAL SATISFACTION WITH NEAR BLOOD RELATIONS FOURTH HOMOSEXUALITY AND FIFTH
WHEN WE REDISCOVER IN THE BACKGROUND OF OUR DISTORTED DREAMS ALL THESE PERVERSE WISH IMPULSES IT MEANS ONLY THAT THE DREAM HAS IN THIS FIELD
INFANTILE SIDE OF PSYCHIC LIFE WHICH WE MAY FIND IN ACTION IN CHILDREN WHICH WE OVERLOOK PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE SLIGHTNESS OF ITS DIMENSIONS PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS LIGHTLY CONSIDERED SINCE WE DEMAND NO ETHICAL HEIGHTS OF THE CHILD
BUT BEING REASONABLE IS ONLY A PART OF PSYCHIC LIFE MANY THINGS ARE TAKING PLACE THERE THAT ARE NOT REASONABLE AND SO IT HAPPENS THAT WE ARE ASHAMED OF SUCH DREAMS AND UNREASONABLY WE TURN THEM OVER TO THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
AND IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT UPON FURTHER STUDY OF THE EVIL IN THE DREAM WE SHALL COME TO SOME OTHER DECISION AND ARRIVE AT ANOTHER VALUATION OF HUMAN NATURE AS A RESULT OF THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION WE GRASP TWO FACTS
WHICH HOWEVER DISCLOSE ONLY THE BEGINNINGS OF NEW RIDDLES NEW DOUBTS FIRST THE REGRESSION OF DREAM WORK IS NOT ONLY FORMAL IT IS ALSO OF GREATER IMPORT IT NOT ONLY TRANSLATES OUR THOUGHTS INTO A PRIMITIVE FORM OF EXPRESSION
UNCONSCIOUS IS NO LONGER A NAME FOR WHAT IS AT THAT TIME LATENT THE UNCONSCIOUS IS AN ESPECIAL PSYCHIC REALM WITH WISH IMPULSES OF ITS OWN WITH ITS OWN METHOD OF EXPRESSION AND WITH A PSYCHIC MECHANISM PECULIAR TO ITSELF
BETWEEN THESE TWO PARTS THE DREAM WORK COMPLETES ITSELF THE INFLUENCING OF THE DAY REMNANTS BY THE UNCONSCIOUS NECESSITATES REGRESSION THIS IS THE DEEPEST INSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF THE DREAM
BUT TO MEN CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE SPECIAL PURPOSE AND AT THE PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE IT WAS EQUALLY DESIRABLE THAT THE IMMEDIATE ELECTION SHOULD BE MADE BY MEN MOST CAPABLE OF ANALYZING THE QUALITIES ADAPTED TO THE STATION
WILL AT LEAST ENTER UPON THE TASK FREE FROM ANY SINISTER BIAS THEIR TRANSIENT EXISTENCE AND THEIR DETACHED SITUATION ALREADY TAKEN NOTICE OF AFFORD A SATISFACTORY PROSPECT OF THEIR CONTINUING SO TO THE CONCLUSION OF IT
ON ALL BUT THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES
OR OF SO CONSIDERABLE A PORTION OF IT AS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAKE HIM A SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE FOR THE DISTINGUISHED OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IT WILL NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY THAT THERE WILL BE A CONSTANT PROBABILITY OF SEEING THE STATION FILLED BY CHARACTERS
THE INFERENCE FROM IT IS THAT A MAN ACTING IN THE CAPACITY OF CHIEF MAGISTRATE UNDER A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME HE MUST LAY DOWN HIS OFFICE WILL BE APT TO FEEL HIMSELF TOO LITTLE INTERESTED IN IT TO HAZARD ANY MATERIAL CENSURE OR PERPLEXITY
FROM THE INDEPENDENT EXERTION OF HIS POWERS OR FROM ENCOUNTERING THE ILL HUMORS HOWEVER TRANSIENT WHICH MAY HAPPEN TO PREVAIL EITHER IN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE SOCIETY ITSELF OR EVEN IN A PREDOMINANT FACTION IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY
IN WHICH A CONDUCT OF THIS KIND HAS SAVED THE PEOPLE FROM VERY FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR OWN MISTAKES AND HAS PROCURED LASTING MONUMENTS OF THEIR GRATITUDE TO THE MEN WHO HAD COURAGE AND MAGNANIMITY ENOUGH TO SERVE THEM AT THE PERIL OF THEIR DISPLEASURE
BUT HOWEVER INCLINED WE MIGHT BE TO INSIST UPON AN UNBOUNDED COMPLAISANCE IN THE EXECUTIVE TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THE PEOPLE WE CAN WITH NO PROPRIETY CONTEND FOR A LIKE COMPLAISANCE TO THE HUMORS OF THE LEGISLATURE
TO WHAT PURPOSE SEPARATE THE EXECUTIVE OR THE JUDICIARY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE IF BOTH THE EXECUTIVE AND THE JUDICIARY ARE SO CONSTITUTED AS TO BE AT THE ABSOLUTE DEVOTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE SUCH A SEPARATION MUST BE MERELY NOMINAL
THOUGH NOT MORE CONCLUSIVE WILL RESULT FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OVER THE PEOPLE WHICH MIGHT BE EMPLOYED TO PREVENT THE RE ELECTION OF A MAN WHO BY AN UPRIGHT RESISTANCE TO ANY SINISTER PROJECT OF THAT BODY SHOULD HAVE MADE HIMSELF
IF A BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS FROM THE MOST FEEBLE BEGINNINGS FROM THE MERE POWER OF ASSENTING OR DISAGREEING TO THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW TAX
ALL THE ANCIENT ESTABLISHMENTS AS WELL IN THE CHURCH AS STATE IF THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE ON A RECENT OCCASION TO MAKE THE MONARCH TREMBLE AT THE PROSPECT
IS TO MAKE THEIR INTERESTS COINCIDE WITH THEIR DUTY EVEN THE LOVE OF FAME THE RULING PASSION OF THE NOBLEST MINDS WHICH WOULD PROMPT A MAN TO PLAN AND UNDERTAKE EXTENSIVE AND ARDUOUS ENTERPRISES FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT
INSTEAD OF THE POSITIVE MERIT OF DOING GOOD ANOTHER ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE TEMPTATION TO SORDID VIEWS TO PECULATION AND IN SOME INSTANCES TO USURPATION
BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT EVEN A PARTIAL EXCLUSION WOULD ALWAYS RENDER THE READMISSION OF THE PERSON A REMOTE AND PRECARIOUS OBJECT THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE WILL APPLY NEARLY AS FULLY TO ONE CASE AS TO THE OTHER
WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES PROMISED TO COUNTERBALANCE THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY ARE REPRESENTED TO BE FIRST GREATER INDEPENDENCE IN THE MAGISTRATE
IN OPPOSITION TO THIS DUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY I TRIED IN THE FIRST ESSAY TO SHOW THAT THOUGHTS AND THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY HOMOGENEOUS AS TO THEIR MATERIAL AND THAT THEIR OPPOSITION IS ONLY ONE OF RELATION AND OF FUNCTION
BECAUSE I HAD TO BE SO BRIEF I NOW RETURN TO THE SUBJECT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR FROM INVALIDATING MY GENERAL THESIS THESE PHENOMENA WHEN PROPERLY ANALYZED AFFORD IT POWERFUL SUPPORT
THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE PURE EXPERIENCE THEORY IS THAT OUTER AND INNER ARE NAMES FOR TWO GROUPS INTO WHICH WE SORT EXPERIENCES ACCORDING TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON THEIR NEIGHBORS
IN THE MIND ON THE CONTRARY THE HARD THING IS NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR IT DENTS NOTHING IT SUFFUSES THROUGH ITS MENTAL NEIGHBORS AS IT WERE AND INTERPENETRATES THEM
IT IS ONLY TOWARDS CERTAIN SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ASSOCIATES THAT THE PHYSICAL ENERGIES AS WE CALL THEM OF A CONTENT ARE PUT FORTH IN ANOTHER GROUP IT MAY BE QUITE INERT
IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW I SHALL TRY TO SHOW ONE THAT THE POPULAR NOTION THAT THESE EXPERIENCES ARE INTUITIVELY GIVEN AS PURELY INNER FACTS IS HASTY AND ERRONEOUS AND TWO
THAT THEIR AMBIGUITY ILLUSTRATES BEAUTIFULLY MY CENTRAL THESIS THAT SUBJECTIVITY AND OBJECTIVITY ARE AFFAIRS NOT OF WHAT AN EXPERIENCE IS ABORIGINALLY MADE OF BUT OF ITS CLASSIFICATION
MAY COUNT AS FEELINGS WHEN WE TAKE THEM SINGLY BUT WHEN THEY COMBINE IN A TOTAL RICHNESS WE CALL THE RESULT THE BEAUTY OF THE OBJECT AND TREAT IT AS AN OUTER ATTRIBUTE WHICH OUR MIND PERCEIVES
PUBLISHED BY SIDIS AND GOODHART IN THEIR IMPORTANT WORK ON MULTIPLE PERSONALITY WE READ THAT WHEN THE PATIENT FIRST RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AND
THE COMMON SENSE STAGE OF THOUGHT IS A PERFECTLY DEFINITE PRACTICAL HALTING PLACE THE PLACE WHERE WE OURSELVES CAN PROCEED TO ACT UNHESITATINGLY ON THIS STAGE OF THOUGHT
INTO THE WATER WHICH IT SETS A BOILING IT IS THE VERY LIGHT OF THE ARC LAMP WHICH DISPLACES THE DARKNESS OF THE MIDNIGHT STREET ET CETERA BY ENGENDERING AND TRANSLOCATING JUST THESE QUALITIES
IT DOES NOT WORK TO ASSUME THAT PHYSICAL OBJECTS ARE GOING TO ACT OUTWARDLY BY THEIR SYMPATHETIC OR ANTIPATHETIC QUALITIES THE BEAUTY OF A THING OR ITS VALUE IS NO FORCE THAT CAN BE PLOTTED IN A POLYGON OF COMPOSITIONS
ITS VICISSITUDES OR DESTINY AT THE HANDS OF PHYSICAL NATURE CHEMICAL AFFINITIES ARE A PURELY VERBAL METAPHOR AND AS I JUST SAID
WHY THEN DO MEN LEAVE THEM AS AMBIGUOUS AS THEY DO AND NOT CLASS THEM DECISIVELY AS PURELY SPIRITUAL THE REASON WOULD SEEM TO BE THAT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE INERT AS REGARDS THE REST OF PHYSICAL NATURE
THEY ARE NOT INERT AS REGARDS THAT PART OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR OWN SKIN COVERS IT IS THOSE VERY APPRECIATIVE ATTRIBUTES OF THINGS THEIR DANGEROUSNESS BEAUTY RARITY UTILITY ET CETERA
FOR THOUGH IN THAT GROUP IT BE TRUE THAT THINGS DO NOT ACT ON ONE ANOTHER BY THEIR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES DO NOT DENT EACH OTHER OR SET FIRE TO EACH OTHER
THE SUN CARESSES IT AND THE ZEPHYR WOOES IT AS IF IT WERE A BED OF ROSES SO THE DISGUSTINGNESS FAILS TO OPERATE WITHIN THE REALM OF SUNS AND BREEZES
AND CONVERSELY OF COURSE WE MUST TREAT IT AS NON MENTAL OR AS MENTAL OUR BODY ITSELF IS THE PALMARY INSTANCE OF THE AMBIGUOUS SOMETIMES I TREAT MY BODY PURELY AS A PART OF OUTER NATURE
AND I HOPE THAT MY READERS ARE NOW READY TO CONCLUDE WITH ME THAT THE PRETENDED SPIRITUALITY OF OUR EMOTIONS AND OF OUR ATTRIBUTES OF VALUE SO FAR FROM PROVING AN OBJECTION TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF PURE EXPERIENCE DOES WHEN RIGHTLY DISCUSSED AND ACCOUNTED FOR
AND FOR THIS THE VILLAGE BOYS WITH WHOM HE PLAYED USED TO QUARREL WITH HIM SAYING FATHERLESS ORPHAN WHY DO YOU CHEAT SO ONE DAY HE ASKED HIS MOTHER WHY THEY CALLED HIM THAT NAME AND WHETHER HIS FATHER WAS REALLY DEAD
BUT THIS ONLY BROKE HER TEETH AND MADE HER MOUTH BLEED SO THAT THE PAIN WAS WORSE THAN BEFORE THEN THE BOY JEERED AT HER AND SAID DID YOU THINK GRANNIE THAT YOU COULD BITE MY IRON BOW AND ARROWS SO SAYING HE LEFT HER
